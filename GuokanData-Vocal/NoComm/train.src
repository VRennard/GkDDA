<vocalsound> Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . Um <vocalsound> I'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally , Sorry . so uh . Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . Um and that people might want it as as <disfmarker> in addition to their existing remote controls . Um <vocalsound> and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it . And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost . Um . <gap> Now uh uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um <disfmarker> the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . Um the uh the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . Um and and then we'll <disfmarker> as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh <disfmarker> Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions . Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh <disfmarker> I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer <disfmarker> they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um <vocalsound> the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background . Um now this doesn't <vocalsound> necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . Um it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that <disfmarker> we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway . Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um mm <vocalsound> uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . Um okay , so uh after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um notes sent out and uh etcetera . Okay , so <vocalsound> we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . Um again I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to <disfmarker> who who who thinks they would like to go go first ? Uh I don't mind . <gap> P fine . Uh can I steal the cable ? Oh sorry , you can indeed . Cheers . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I got a <disfmarker> how do I start there ? Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . That one . That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the <disfmarker> our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . Um <vocalsound> everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are <disfmarker> how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly <vocalsound> . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um <vocalsound> they they don't uh <disfmarker> they , yeah , they only use <disfmarker> they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh <disfmarker> I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . <vocalsound> Uh again , seventy five percent is <disfmarker> seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just <disfmarker> they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume <gap> . <vocalsound> And uh yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like <disfmarker> well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the <disfmarker> uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very <disfmarker> aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . Uh um yeah and uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . I dunno Mm . maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate <gap> , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . Maybe like it'll beep or something . And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is <disfmarker> Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new <disfmarker> like first time users and stuff . And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use <disfmarker> have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice <disfmarker> the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . Mm . Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would <disfmarker> if people would pay more for speech recognition <vocalsound> <gap> and younger people say they would . And uh there was another section on our <disfmarker> on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , Mm . Right . Mm . so . <vocalsound> May be incrementally emitting , but yeah . Yeah , I must say that um the uh <disfmarker> I c can't remember what <vocalsound> um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh um And uh <vocalsound> it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a thought and it it cuts out uh <disfmarker> I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , <vocalsound> j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry . Yeah , um <disfmarker> oh yeah , so <vocalsound> possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . Um . You see this okay ? Almost <disfmarker> no ? It's <disfmarker> sorry it's a bit <gap> . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on <disfmarker> or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , Mm . which are low relevance <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . I mean <disfmarker> and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily <disfmarker> It could be <disfmarker> oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? Have you seen the new mo mobile phones Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , Oh yeah . so you could have the most <vocalsound> used buttons on top Mm . and flip it out or something . Hmm , hmm . Mm . Yeah , like the one that like slides back Uh . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? and the buttons are concealed underneath . Yeah . Mm . If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um <vocalsound> remove them altogether . Just remove them completely ? That might be the <disfmarker> We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um <disfmarker> I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um now the the age structure we were looking at <disfmarker> um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now Uh yeah . do we know whether they <disfmarker> Forty <disfmarker> no sorry <disfmarker> for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes we <disfmarker> Um no this is for <disfmarker> pay more for speech recognition . That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at <disfmarker> um well again , we don't know the relative proportion <disfmarker> the relative numbers in the age groups . Yeah , that's true . If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . P Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ <disfmarker> It might <disfmarker> Or even <disfmarker> I mean you could even just have it left on . You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ Maybe i and never have to <disfmarker> Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box <vocalsound> and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it . Yeah . Mm . It c well it <disfmarker> I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , Mm . No . because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , <vocalsound> B_B_C_ one . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> so it probably needs to be um <disfmarker> possibly actually need a button on it Yeah , that's true . just to activate it . Oh yeah . Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then <disfmarker> Yeah . uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . <vocalsound> Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there , Mm-mm . <vocalsound> would people miss them ? But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . <vocalsound> Relevance of two out of ten , yeah . Vol volume , Yeah . yes um They're not used often th <vocalsound> but they are quite important when they're used . w we need to s identify things that <vocalsound> people actually need Yeah . and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume Mm . and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Yeah . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that <vocalsound> uh would appear to be essential . Stand out . Um . So <disfmarker> if we can design something that that looks interesting , know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's <gap> the yellow and grey , um and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option . Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . Do , please . Uh you were saying about um it could <disfmarker> technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . we could maybe have like an activation word . 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , You cer certainly could . where you just <disfmarker> you address the remote , Mm . <vocalsound> Depe uh i depends whether um <disfmarker> you address the computer , and then give it a command . if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see . B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could print <disfmarker> actually print it on the uh <vocalsound> Mm-hmm , yeah . device itself . Um . I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . S th this I th <vocalsound> that's always gonna be a problem I think . <vocalsound> Mm . Um and I I I s so I suppose one um <disfmarker> could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with <disfmarker> Oh no I I interrupted you , or <disfmarker> no no , no sorry <vocalsound> . uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . <vocalsound> Oh okay . Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . Mm okay . <vocalsound> We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , combined with uh decrease the <disfmarker> or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . <gap> alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since <disfmarker> if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd <disfmarker> it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . Mm-hmm . S s we could <disfmarker> we could make it dual function <gap> voice recognition and <gap> still have buttons on it um <vocalsound> Oh , we could , yeah . We c yeah , we could even have it as like a <disfmarker> yeah the buttons control this 'cause we're <disfmarker> and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so . <vocalsound> Certainly could . Yeah , yeah . So uh yeah , Mm . if we could uh <disfmarker> power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really <disfmarker> <gap> The <disfmarker> I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . Yeah and probably it would look better as well . No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . Yeah . yeah . Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . Mm . Lined with numbered buttons and <disfmarker> Mm , yeah . Okay , who <disfmarker> sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . Yep , yep . Um <vocalsound> given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay well , I can do mine . Hmm . Do you want the cable ? Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um . Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something . Oh . F_ eight . F_ eight . Is it doing <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Dunno . Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . Okay . Ah , Oh yeah , Oh okay . there we go . <vocalsound> it's going . <vocalsound> Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . Alright . So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are <disfmarker> what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So these are the two different ones . This one um <disfmarker> this is the user centred , <vocalsound> it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , Mm-hmm . and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you <disfmarker> it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a <disfmarker> you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , Mm , yeah . then that would be easier . Um <vocalsound> and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was <disfmarker> when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it <disfmarker> maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . So that's my presentation . Yeah . Okay , can I um <disfmarker> I'm actually gonna use the um <disfmarker> it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . I'm actually gonna use the <disfmarker> F they probably clip to you . Oh yeah , they might be movable . Yeah . Oh yeah , they're all <disfmarker> they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em . <vocalsound> Yes , rather than the uh the the traditional <disfmarker> in fact , um I won't even go that far . Um something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can <disfmarker> that's sort of a more vertical shape , um that you you sort of hold in your hand , um , well I'm trying to think uh uh uh l uh l such as <disfmarker> I mean um something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the uh the infrared or whatever source . Mm . Uh so that you know , it's flying off in all directions , Mm . so that uh um uh <vocalsound> again the <disfmarker> n need to look at the the the technicalities of um <vocalsound> actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh <disfmarker> such a source , um you know , compromise the <disfmarker> our our need for uh you know , it it being um mm permanently uh you know , available . Uh whether whether different technology <disfmarker> um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . Um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for <disfmarker> i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else . <vocalsound> Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , but again , except that um <disfmarker> you know the risk of losing it . Um anyway okay um so Kate , wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ? Yes , mm . <gap> Oh . Which one does this plug into ? Hmm I think it's all there . That one . H I can't <disfmarker> did you <gap> <disfmarker> could you see it on you screen when it <disfmarker> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> That's not cool . <vocalsound> That's kind of strange . Oh well . Anyways . Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh . <vocalsound> Oh there we go . Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um and it does this uh by <disfmarker> well , you need <disfmarker> to start off you need an energy source <vocalsound> and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is <disfmarker> that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um <disfmarker> Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , <vocalsound> uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . And um <disfmarker> oops . Uh-huh . This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . Uh this just kinda represents the energy source Hmm . which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um <vocalsound> a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between <disfmarker> so it'll light up once we start <disfmarker> once you start pressing buttons . Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually <disfmarker> <vocalsound> what ? Sends signals to the the television . And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there . <vocalsound> And so my personal preferences <disfmarker> I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface <vocalsound> um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . And that's pretty much it . Okay . Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make Mm . <gap> before we um <disfmarker> I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . Mm . Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . Um given you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing . <vocalsound> Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one <disfmarker> some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last know , five , ten years . By which time <disfmarker> I mean when all's said and done , the digital television <vocalsound> will be taking over in that time scale . Um Mm . Mm-hmm . uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh <disfmarker> Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . Oh , cool . <vocalsound> Yeah , fair enough . <vocalsound> Um it's , you know , it's <disfmarker> what it saves in cost and you know there there's a <disfmarker> well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it <disfmarker> It could have like uh <disfmarker> know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm , mm . Are are people really gonna use it though ? Um . <vocalsound> I suppose , yeah . Yeah , people are pro Mm yeah <vocalsound> I would think that people might forget <disfmarker> I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , <gap> I I th I think <disfmarker> Mm-mm . so . Yeah , <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> it's um <disfmarker> I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge Mm . and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Um . 'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> And that's pretty much <disfmarker> When it <disfmarker> yeah , wh when it's died is a problem . yeah . Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in , Yeah , yeah , <vocalsound> yeah , <gap> so uh um yeah . <vocalsound> what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ? Yeah , think that's a good idea . Uh . That sounds pretty good , yeah . No . Is the uh <disfmarker> you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here . Um . Mm . Um you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective . Do they make batteries that last that long ? I mean th th certainly . Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , <vocalsound> They usually have the little light uh <vocalsound> source , but there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example . I dunno what the heck they're called , Yeah , they have that little solar <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> but yeah , the little cells <vocalsound> Som well some do , that <disfmarker> I mean th th but there are battery ones Yeah . that um are you know , sort of permanently sealed . Mm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . In in fact I'd <disfmarker> Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , Yeah , uh uh <disfmarker> so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , Mm . but you will have the battery there for when you need it . Yeah , I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit . Mm . I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating Mm . I would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . Oh , Um . <gap> it depend if it's <disfmarker> uh depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , Yeah , some people are <disfmarker> If , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market yeah . Yeah , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . then they're clicking a lot , yeah . <vocalsound> W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight n <vocalsound> Per hour ? times per hour . Right . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Wow . <vocalsound> That's a lot . <vocalsound> Oh , I must admit I hadn't um <disfmarker> I'd I'd missed that . That does sound excessive . But then again , if you think it <disfmarker> of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . That's <disfmarker> it's less than a second , um . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Well that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , Mm . or whether it's just a <vocalsound> Yeah . sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . Um . Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , Yeah . Mm . so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . channels that way instead of <disfmarker> Mm . <gap> <vocalsound> Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . Um 'cause we're we're getting Uh-oh . um <disfmarker> right , so I'd <disfmarker> I need to sum up very quickly here um . <vocalsound> We're looking at extreme simplicity . We're looking at a radically different shape . Possibly no buttons at all um , but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . Um in the <disfmarker> I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if <disfmarker> clearly only need the main functions . Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and <vocalsound> there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . <vocalsound> Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? Yeah . Yeah . Yep . Hmm . <vocalsound> Right . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So uh <disfmarker> Oh <vocalsound> Yeah . We are doing just the television . I just have one question . So are we doing just the television or are we doing <disfmarker> so not D_V_D_ players , No . we okay , okay . I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , Mm . no ? Okay . Yeah , like in the email of television only . In fact they're <gap> in the constraints email that I got . Right . Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? Oh yeah well Mm . th that's one I s that's one I sent you , Yeah . which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh <disfmarker> what came down from from head office . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh okay . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh <vocalsound> okay . Okay . <vocalsound> That's <vocalsound> that that that that's their uh their view . <vocalsound> Okay , so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed . Okay . Cool . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> Okay . <gap> . Right . Okay . Alright . Is everyone here ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yep . <vocalsound> Yep . Okay . This is our conceptual design meeting . And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um <vocalsound> and our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um um that remotes zap a lot . Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . <vocalsound> Um and that they often lose the <disfmarker> it's easy to lose a remote . Um which were all things we were thinking we would <disfmarker> wanna make it simple . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And uh some sort of locator . Either a button or tracking device . Um <disfmarker> And that it should look different than what's out there . Um <disfmarker> Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . Um the simple versus the um the complex . The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um <disfmarker> Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different . And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> How that would power the remote and the lamp . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , <vocalsound> which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um <disfmarker> I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . <vocalsound> And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also . Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . So <disfmarker> Marketing ? Okay . We're watching trends . Yep . Can I have your cable please ? I suppose that you can have this . <vocalsound> Thanks . Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . <vocalsound> So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . <vocalsound> Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and <disfmarker> Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . <vocalsound> A banana shape ? Oh it was sort of banana shaped . <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . <vocalsound> So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . And then the spongy feel . I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . C and look at different types of material that <vocalsound> might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . So that's that . So possibly like a uh , Alright . <vocalsound> sorry , just to butt in for a second . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? That's what I was thinking yeah . Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So when you buy your remote you can buy feel to it . <vocalsound> You can <disfmarker> various coverings . Mm various covers . What's it called ? Cust you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Personalise your remote . personalised , yeah . <vocalsound> We could leave that to the cover department . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We all know they've got nothing to do all day . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Why can't I see the <disfmarker> crazy . Um yeah I <disfmarker> talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . <vocalsound> So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a <disfmarker> there is a picture <gap> . You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there <disfmarker> has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out . And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . That is a <vocalsound> possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know <gap> if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be <disfmarker> need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the <disfmarker> do it <disfmarker> or program all that on the control bit . And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . Um I don't <disfmarker> it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . Stuff like <gap> gets more and more compli complicated . And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . And that is it . Why am I <disfmarker> Oh yeah . Just <gap> . <gap> Where are we ? Uh . Just to sort of show you . M <gap> they've even got things like that . <vocalsound> Huge things . Which is just <gap> for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Notice the giant dog bone shape ? <vocalsound> Dunno . And that <disfmarker> yeah . Makes sense , makes sense . <vocalsound> Also good for animals . Yeah . See . <gap> things <gap> . <gap> . Why's my screen crazy ? Uh <disfmarker> Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do . Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . Okay . The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . <vocalsound> The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really <gap> top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um <disfmarker> So much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . <vocalsound> Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . Right . Pretty clear . Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . This is the circuit board from the other side . Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . Um you can see the circuit board itself . That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . These are the actual keys that are being pressed . They close the electric circuit . That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . That would be behind here . Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that <vocalsound> amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . <vocalsound> Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . And thus gives on the signal . Now this is the simple version . <vocalsound> Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . And not only that . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . Um <vocalsound> I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . So it's pretty squishy . <vocalsound> Spongy ? That would that would serve that purpose . Um <vocalsound> we could also use wood , or titanium . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh fya <vocalsound> I don't have an information on that . However our company <vocalsound> obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It certainly is an expensive material , I'm aware of that , <vocalsound> but I was given an okay . <vocalsound> But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these . Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . Right ? Uh a dynamo . Interestingly enough . <vocalsound> Um we could use solar cells . Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? Um solar cell is interesting . <vocalsound> May fail though , every here and there . Would you have to leave it by the window ? Mm . Yeah <gap> yeah . <vocalsound> . Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week Yeah . and <disfmarker> yeah mm . Always the <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Y probably not yeah . exactly . Yeah . Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . <vocalsound> So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . We don't need that then . Um <disfmarker> However our interface options are push-buttons . In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . Um <disfmarker> However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . And they are possible . We have an okay for scroll wheels . Okay . Um however <vocalsound> when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . This however may exclude certain um materials . If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . Hence we might not be able to put it in there . So um <disfmarker> There's also restrictions <vocalsound> to , when it comes to the chip . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . <vocalsound> So that's for the for the scroll wheel . Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for for that . Let's see now . Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right ? Mm . Or is anybody still <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go . alright . No . Hmm . <vocalsound> Alright . Yeah . Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . Um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . We would just be able to make it flat and and um yeah a straight design pretty much . Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Would the sort of <vocalsound> spongy and the the plasticky thing <disfmarker> y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a <disfmarker> it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . Mm . Like a covering . Yeah . So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know <gap> in plastic . But then where do people hold it ? Just all be sort of spongy . Yeah . The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you <vocalsound> as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? Like the iPod ? You can have an L_C_D_ screen . Um but therefore no rubber will be used . Right . Alright ? So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . Um latex is tricky . Or rubber and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . Yeah . <vocalsound> Or wood even . Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . Yeah . Or make it just push-buttons . Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . Maybe not the nicest feel . Or not much originality really . So the ru wait the rubbery <disfmarker> we can shape it however we want ? Or the rubbery we cannot ? <vocalsound> With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , 'Kay . but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . Mm . Mm . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's the tricky thing . Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . So that's <gap> thing if we did it yellow . Yeah . And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any <disfmarker> they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? S Certainly can be done yes . Um yeah . if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . Yeah . Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . I assume . Yeah . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The fruit design um <disfmarker> How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , Mm . but uh give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . You name it . Mm . What about a smell ? Just design-wise . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> T <vocalsound> to the remote ? <vocalsound> Mm . Nice one . You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . In different ye yellows . Bright citrus colours yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . I don't suppose we have to stick to co Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , Stick to the colours yeah . Oh yeah . Yellow and grey . that's yellow and grey . Yellow and grey . So what have we , lemon , banana , is <disfmarker> Mm grapefruit . <vocalsound> Grapefruit . <vocalsound> Grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . But <disfmarker> mm . I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> . Um <disfmarker> I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> like <disfmarker> Yeah . Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . <vocalsound> Well we kinda do yeah . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . Yeah . <vocalsound> And if it's yellow ? <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . Right . It's it's yellow . It's curved . I it's yellow . Grey buttons yeah . Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? <vocalsound> It's sort of <vocalsound> couple of couple of grey stripes . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey . It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . Mm . Yeah . There you go . Rather than <disfmarker> <vocalsound> rather th <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It could <disfmarker> and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , Oh . and then people would always know where it was . Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . Nice . Could look like a fruit bowl . It could be an ape . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Could be , <vocalsound> Yeah . it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . we could have a variety of options here . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . Yeah . Do you have more to your presentation ? <vocalsound> That's pretty much it . I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on Oh . <disfmarker> there you go . Okay . I'm gonna plug in here real quick . Sure . If I could . Hang on . There you go . Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . Um <disfmarker> ow . Ow . So is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ? Well we sort of <disfmarker> <gap> rid of that because <gap> gonna use a battery . And the base station might not be necessary . Oh right okay . Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . Mm . We can still do that . However <vocalsound> of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . Mm-hmm . So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . Mm . You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there . Mm . <vocalsound> But could be done , of course . Okay . Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . Probably case um material . And probably a shape also . Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . And what kind of supplements we'll have . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . Right . And we have five minutes . Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be Mm . a cheap one . Right ? 'Kay . So <disfmarker> Um I guess we should pick the case then . If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . Yeah . But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? Well what about what you said , like putting the Just <disfmarker> <gap> . just maybe <disfmarker> finger grips just on top of the plastic ? yeah . Just a little bit of <gap> . Okay . So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? <gap> as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . 'Kay . So I guess the case would be plastic , with <disfmarker> Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . Yeah . <gap> . Yeah . M more of a l lamination perhaps . <vocalsound> Yeah . So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? Yeah I think so . Yeah ? I think <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? Yes . It does . 'Kay . So <disfmarker> I guess that , is that , is that about it ? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? Right . Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Here's what's gonna be going on . Um <disfmarker> Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um <disfmarker> Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . Right . Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> maybe and and get us a prototype . <vocalsound> Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . So that <vocalsound> basically <gap> just be working on the prototype , <vocalsound> uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> Okay . Let's do it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
Mm-hmm ? Okay . Ooh . <gap> So we're 'kay ? On the <gap> or <disfmarker> No . I dunno where to put it 'cause the <disfmarker> Okay . Could you s take it off ? <gap> . Is that alright ? <vocalsound> <gap> or <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Keeps coming off . 'S fiddly . Hmm . <vocalsound> <gap> Right . How do we sta wa how do we start ? Does anybody know ? Oh , another one . <vocalsound> So that's this <disfmarker> Oh okay , right . Are we free to take notes uh <disfmarker> Okay . Uh <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <gap> . Hmm . Okay , just hang on a second everybody . I haven't actually looked at this yet . <vocalsound> Ah . <gap> um <disfmarker> Very nice . I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . If you're all ready . Yeah . So <gap> is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . Project aim is a new remote control . It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . 'Kay . Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting . Tool training . Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . Okay . Um . Uh Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ? Okay . So are we supposed to bring the little things for the <disfmarker> Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on <disfmarker> clip <vocalsound> <disfmarker> do you have a belt ? Clip <gap> . Mm . Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> okay . So my favourite animal <disfmarker> Yeah , what's your favourite animal ? 'Kay um <disfmarker> Ah . Is it rude ? It's an elephant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's a very good elephant . The back end of an elephant . Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well . <vocalsound> 'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal . Um <vocalsound> okay , it's big , it's got a great memory . Does it ? Oh . Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . Mm . Mm . And uh dunno know why but <vocalsound> looks like nice to me . Okay . Wonderful , well done . Nice animal . Do you want to use the wipe <disfmarker> the m the wiper and wipe it off ? Okay . And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? <vocalsound> Aesthetic yep , sure . I have no idea what my favourite animal is . 'Kay , my favourite animal , <vocalsound> uh let's see . Oh . It's <disfmarker> Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . It's a liger <vocalsound> , No . A what ? a combination of a lion and tiger <vocalsound> . Alright . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? How <gap> . No . No . No . Oh it's a hilarious movie . You have to see it . And and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . <vocalsound> Okay , well done . Great . Me ? Yeah . Miss mar Miss Marketing ? Okay . Not quite sure how this is gonna work . There <gap> go . <vocalsound> Cool . <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> well I'll try my best <vocalsound> to draw . Can I just draw the face ? Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . <vocalsound> Ooh . It's a cat . That's a very pr pretty cat . <vocalsound> Which also has what ? A big fat body and big <disfmarker> and a long tail . Okay , <vocalsound> Why ? do y do you wanna do some <disfmarker> write <vocalsound> you wanna just write some words about it ? Because um cuddly . And usually cats are very friendly . Usually . And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so <disfmarker> Wow , so they're kinda spiritual . <vocalsound> So , that's why I like cats . Well done . There we are , that's me . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Mm . Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal , but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Uh . I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Really ? <vocalsound> Oh that's a <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> no <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A prairie dog ? <gap> no <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh a squirrel ? That's exactly what it is . <vocalsound> Uh not a very good one <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Not bad I would say . Yeah , that's pretty good . Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . <vocalsound> Very good . Ah . Alright . Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . <vocalsound> Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . Market range internationally sold . Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be <disfmarker> can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . Ah right okay . <gap> experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? Stuff like that . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . <vocalsound> At quarter to twelve . <vocalsound> So I think before we close uh , we are expected <disfmarker> I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . S Yeah , I think we're <disfmarker> I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for <disfmarker> Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Mm . oh okay . Yeah . I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but <disfmarker> Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would <disfmarker> roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? Pretty much everybody . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , I think we've all got <disfmarker> Uh . <vocalsound> Um . Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control . Okay . 'Kay um . Well . <vocalsound> T A new remote control for T_V_ . What would I like ? <vocalsound> Um . W what <disfmarker> You want it big do you want it small . Medium . Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah it seems like there's like <disfmarker> there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , <vocalsound> Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . Maybe you <disfmarker> Mm . yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . Yeah . 'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , <vocalsound> Mm . but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per <disfmarker> how much ? Twelve fifty . Twelve fifty . <vocalsound> It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . Each . Per unit , yeah . Cost . So do we have to be realistic within the budget or <disfmarker> Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we <disfmarker> Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah . Guess <disfmarker> 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these <disfmarker> any of these ideas are feasible or not . Right . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things . Yeah . Um . Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? <vocalsound> Like so you have one in like <disfmarker> mm Yeah . it doesn't have to be really thick . I mean remote controls can be thin bits . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . <vocalsound> 'Kay . <gap> have slides . And then it all comes compact Okay , that's <gap> . into one . So it's not <disfmarker> you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . <vocalsound> Th that's an idea . Yeah . So you just flip them out . Okay . Um <gap> have uh one very complicated one on one side with <vocalsound> all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o <vocalsound> one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and <vocalsound> minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . One side for kids , one side for adults . <vocalsound> I'm not sure if that's like <disfmarker> Yeah . Or grandma as well , you know it's like <vocalsound> what is the mute button . I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold <disfmarker> like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but <disfmarker> Oh . Oh okay . Like it <gap> or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . That would be cool . I was thinking that like a flip . F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . Mm-hmm . Um , oh we've got five minutes left . Start breaking up . Okay . Um . But <disfmarker> okay . Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . <gap> . Yeah , we should uh <disfmarker> I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception <disfmarker> you know <gap> stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate Yeah . D_V_D_ players , things like that . I have got <disfmarker> I think we should also have a back-up plan of <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that <disfmarker> I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . Yeah . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just <disfmarker> that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . Yeah . Okay . Right . What do you reckon ? Yeah , I mean <gap> . See 'cause , <gap> I'm just thinking <disfmarker> bearing in mind th we've gotta <disfmarker> we have to have something that's cheap to make . Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um <vocalsound> I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , Yeah . uh simple to use , and looks decent and <disfmarker> May w you know , maybe even <disfmarker> But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people I mean if it's if it's just like <disfmarker> or so people that uh b don't see very well or <disfmarker> big buttons for <disfmarker> touchy buttons for <disfmarker> Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , Yeah . Yeah . certain certain demographic <disfmarker> Or just one that looks really fucking cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah , no I think you're right . <vocalsound> Could be really light or , I dunno , something special . Yeah , rathe rather than focus on <disfmarker> Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about <gap> do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should <disfmarker> Y <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . I mean obviously everyone <disfmarker> we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but <vocalsound> that's not gonna happen . <vocalsound> I think a flip up thing , <vocalsound> 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this <disfmarker> well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and <disfmarker> ooh , the telephone's <disfmarker> the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , Yeah . yeah . But make it like really snazzy and cool <gap> people will want it . So make it <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . Mm . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No porn channel for children . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Um alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got um <disfmarker> I guess that's good good for now . Let's move on . Mm . Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay . W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? Industrial Designer Ah ri okay . um which is <disfmarker> <gap> these are requirement specification . That's <disfmarker> Um . And I'm marketing . Mm . Yeah , there you go . <vocalsound> So <gap> <disfmarker> User Interface Designer , that's that's That's me . Okay . that's you , so you gotta <gap> you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um . Right . Right . Industrial Designer , you are the one <gap> , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um whether it's <gap> what goes into the box , somehow . Mm . Har how it works an And in marketing <disfmarker> <vocalsound> These are requirement specification . Bu User requirements specifications . So what the user requires Yeah , Do you think our two kind of overlap , because <disfmarker> in a remote . what <disfmarker> Right , okay , yeah . Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . I guess that's what it says . You two <vocalsound> you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you <disfmarker> working together . Yeah . Yeah . You're the one that's gotta go and find out <disfmarker> do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . Mm . <vocalsound> Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay everyone , well done . Good meeting . Alright , see you in thirty minutes . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> , do we take these off ? I don't <disfmarker>
<vocalsound> Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the <disfmarker> I have to make sure that this attachment will open . <vocalsound> I keep forgetting whether I've done this . <gap> . Ah-ha . Okay . We'll open that when the time is right . In the meantime <disfmarker> Closing things down , okay . Let's see what this thing does . Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? Ah , we came up together , we're good . Okay . Are we ready to start ? Okay . It's now quarter of four . This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . Okay . Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay . Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to <disfmarker> Where is it ? <vocalsound> Red . I need to open mine . Not the agenda . Agenda three . No that th I want the minutes from the previous <disfmarker> minutes . Mm . That should be there , minutes . Yeah . Okay . Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations . <vocalsound> Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? Yes . Yep . Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation . Ta-da . Alright . Over to you . Right . Well . Ooh , two . Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . <vocalsound> Ah . This is the one that I made . Uh-huh . It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter <disfmarker> takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television <gap> . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . 'Kay . Okay . Um as for what it's actually made of <disfmarker> well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right <vocalsound> in the different menus . Okay . Uh position , I presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? <vocalsound> Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just <disfmarker> if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . <vocalsound> Also with on off switch and infrared <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . So like uh <disfmarker> well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one <disfmarker> or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the <disfmarker> uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . <vocalsound> Uh material <disfmarker> yeah , that's what I have to say about material . Can I scroll down on there and see what else <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Well colour , I think <disfmarker> I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . <vocalsound> So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm <disfmarker> yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . Um well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case <disfmarker> oops , <vocalsound> that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a <disfmarker> quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um <vocalsound> the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material . Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really . I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . This one has n A banana . banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like <disfmarker> yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and <vocalsound> Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? <vocalsound> Hold them , you see , you know . Curvature , is it to your liking ? Oh I see , the on-off's in the back . Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . <vocalsound> If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . And then you can use your thumb . <vocalsound> And it was partly we thought the design looked better , Yeah . <gap> I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the Breaking , you know <disfmarker> oh right . <vocalsound> yeah . Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . Hmm . It's really kind of a <disfmarker> Yeah , <gap> we really like we really like that design , I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know , Mm-hmm mm-hmm . just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , <vocalsound> but better . Yeah . But it's also like texting , you don't <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , yeah , Hmm . I mean it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? <vocalsound> Yeah . And it's a very simple design , It's texting . there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite <disfmarker> it looks quite different . Hmm . You know , I I d I have several <disfmarker> four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to <disfmarker> Yeah . you know , this is really identifiable . <vocalsound> I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean actually how to program the menus Mm-hmm . and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , Mm-hmm . but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . Okay . The next item is evaluation . No , okay . Uh if that's <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> if you're finished . <vocalsound> Uh yeah , we're finished . Mm-hmm . shall I take your uh power ? Oh sorry . Oh . <vocalsound> Try again . Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board . Okay . So um fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap . Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . Mm , yeah , price . Hmm . We'll put price up at the top . <vocalsound> Not that we actually know anything about it , <vocalsound> but we can we can pretend . <vocalsound> Well we will soon , unfortunately . Um Okay , so <disfmarker> Come on . Did you say <gap> ? No , <gap> . Uh okay , so wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and <disfmarker> which <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . I'd call these quite uh minimalist , Yes , a plain , simple , clean design . simple and plain , but I mean I do see what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , Mm-hmm . so in that respect it is quite fancy . <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> yeah , so in that respect <disfmarker> I think we'll go with that respect . I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , Yeah . I'd say maybe aesthetic . <vocalsound> Well we have got s trendy further down , Elegant . but <disfmarker> Elegant . Elegant . Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant . Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um <disfmarker> <gap> like stylish or aesthetic . Yeah . Stylish , yeah . Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Fancy . Yeah . <vocalsound> N that <disfmarker> um Did you just break the pen ? yeah <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> the uh <disfmarker> is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level . Well d we'll just call it fancy then . Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps <disfmarker> and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow in terms of <disfmarker> I think that's a really superior <disfmarker> Yeah , I think we n we need to <disfmarker> they're both <disfmarker> they're both yellow with black buttons , Yeah . it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . Mm . Yeah . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two Yeah . that isn't <disfmarker> that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , As a banana . I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . so . Yeah . And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk . The chunk . So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , No , is it . but I mean in terms <disfmarker> Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . we have to evaluate one of them . Unless <disfmarker> do you guys wanna evaluate both ? I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . <vocalsound> Yeah , I'd <disfmarker> It's more true than false , about a two . Okay . So we say true . <vocalsound> technologically innovative . <vocalsound> I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . Yeah . I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . So we'll say <disfmarker> we'll say uh false . Easy to use . Very . Yes . <vocalsound> One , is that inappropriate ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . Oh , pardon me . Um Trendy . trendy , s <vocalsound> and I say specifically spongy fruity . Oh yes . Mm-hmm . Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific <disfmarker> We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . Hmm . I think <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , so but <disfmarker> two ? Um Yeah . Excess buttons . are there excess buttons ? No . No . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That is false . So that's false . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . True . Ugly . No . <vocalsound> No . No . People don't respond well to ugly . Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people <disfmarker> Yeah , I think they're different , like oh , Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think . aren't they ? I like it . yeah . Yeah , I do too . It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . Oh yeah . And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ? With the <disfmarker> Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? Yeah , with the energy . If it's <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . Yeah . It is going to be kinetic ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . Uh so yes . Yeah , but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , Well <vocalsound> you're still in the Play-Doh stage . but yeah . Yeah . Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . Okay . Yes , the instinct says true . So true one or should I go to two or three ? I'd put it at one I think , but <disfmarker> Okay . I dunno , I would say maybe a two , what do you <disfmarker> 'cause we still <disfmarker> we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . Yeah , true , I mean it's not just like <disfmarker> I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , it might be the <disfmarker> Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get . yeah , yeah , true . True . whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all <disfmarker> they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . Hmm . Yeah , that's a good point . <gap> uh we need somebody to develop that . Um other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna <disfmarker> instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that <disfmarker> 'cause I have to do an average . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Right . And then um excess buttons . Just putting no excess buttons . Exactly . Wow we're doing really well . Yeah , be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity . As for <disfmarker> see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . Mm-hmm . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but but we are at the upper end of the push button market . <vocalsound> Or L_C_D_ . Yeah . Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these <disfmarker> um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here <disfmarker> if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those . I think we're good . <vocalsound> Okay . Mm . Okay . So <disfmarker> We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance . Okay . Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you Yep . and I'll uh figure out the average here . Right . Thank you for everyone's help with that . Right . And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um and it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . <vocalsound> Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . Okay . Well , just kinetic then , <gap> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um what's a hand dynamo ? That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . <vocalsound> It's the wind-up . <vocalsound> Oh shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um <disfmarker> and how many of those will we need per <disfmarker> Just one . we only need one . Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple <disfmarker> Just checking that . Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . Okay , and we only need one of those . Yep . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it <gap> single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's <disfmarker> Yeah , that that one is single curve , that's uh uh one . isn't it ? Um do we have What does double curved mean , I don't understand . And that's I I think you <disfmarker> it means you reverse the curve . uh that's the the one that goes like this . Oh Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , no , we don't need that . No . Right . you can do a banana in single curve , Single-curved , I'd say . No , single curve . yeah . Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . I <vocalsound> I just wanna say plastic . We had the special colour . And did we say plastic ? Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may <disfmarker> One , two , three , four , five , six . I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , Yeah . but it depends on the cost , I guess . Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button <disfmarker> push button interface . That's what we're using , It's just button . Yeah . Yes . isn't it ? Yep . Yeah . Do we need to say how many buttons , or Whoops , don't want that , not yet . Um <disfmarker> or d is it just one ? No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . 'Kay . And the buttons <disfmarker> Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? Uh they'll be rubber , yep . So we need one of them . And are they any special form ? Well yeah , like the compass point one . Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic . 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case . Oh . Yeah , they could be plastic . <vocalsound> Okay . Um let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . It's just one , isn't it ? Uh we only need one of them . Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . What , we're in . Yeah . We're in . <vocalsound> That's us . More profit . Great . Okay , I'm going to save this into our <vocalsound> desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit . Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? Yeah . There we are . That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , Yes . go to the project evaluation , next slide . Right . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . Yeah , leadership , Sure . Yeah . teamwork , Yes . means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . <vocalsound> And Play-Doh . Uh-huh . Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yep . Okay . <vocalsound> So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above . Yep . Um did we find any new ideas ? I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I <disfmarker> that really opened my eyes . Yeah . <vocalsound> Spongy . I I only speak for myself though . And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , <vocalsound> Yeah . so . Good work as a design team , <vocalsound> Yeah , I think we're a good team actually . because we <disfmarker> I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . So we actually worked well as a group . I thought so . Right . Are the costs within the budget ? Oh yes . Yes . Yes . Yes . Is the project evaluated ? Yes . Yes . Yes . I can give you a number , Oh hang on , we haven't heard . <vocalsound> um it's uh <disfmarker> Uh-huh . the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine <disfmarker> we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , To maintain old technology , exactly . Mm-hmm . which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget . so . Yes . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So we do count as I think excellent or one . Alright . <gap> . And we've therefore <disfmarker> we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done . Okay . We done good , Bring on the ice sculptures . and we're finished in time . Nice . And then we get the product launch party . So we might have to wait . Yeah . Product launch party ? <vocalsound> Yeah . That's what I said , ice sculptures . <vocalsound> Absolutely . <vocalsound> Um I <disfmarker> one thing I want to do is <disfmarker> oh , I think the meeting's done . I believe that is the end of our meeting . Yeah . Thank you , Melissa . <vocalsound> Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved . The right files . Final meeting market
Okay um , welcome to our detailed design meeting . I'm pretty excited . Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . Okay um the agenda <disfmarker> we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . We'll look at the finances and finally a <disfmarker> do a production evaluation and close . So , starting off with the um last <disfmarker> the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . Okay ? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first . Right , do you wanna start ? Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one . Um we have our colours not <disfmarker> are not fixed , but this is the general shape . Um it's <disfmarker> you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even <disfmarker> I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push <disfmarker> if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if <disfmarker> uh the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . That's our number one prototype . Um do you wanna present the potato , <gap> like a little lightning in it . or shall I present the Martian ? Okay , um <disfmarker> The little lightning bolt in it , very cute . What <disfmarker> We call that one the rhombus , I could <disfmarker> uh the rhombus . The v the rhombus rhombus ? That's the rhombus , yep . Um this one is known as the potato , uh it's <vocalsound> it's a <vocalsound> <vocalsound> how can I present it ? It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select and that's basically it , that's the potato . Um on , off ? Uh that would be one of your channels , basically , so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , Okay . Yeah we turn it off . yeah . Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? Um not really , <gap> it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . Mm-hmm . If you pressed and held it maybe . Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . That'd work , yeah . If you like held it down , that would be on off . Yeah . On off , that's a possibility , yeah . Okay . And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . <vocalsound> We have the five preset seeds <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . So , that's for your consideration as well , Let's pass . plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . Sorry , what's the yellow one in the middle , <vocalsound> I forgot . <vocalsound> Uh the menu select button . <vocalsound> <gap> Very interesting . <vocalsound> I think that one's my favourite . So that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So that's our three prototypes . Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , Mm 'kay . maybe with with less contrasts on it . Yeah , Would <disfmarker> something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but <disfmarker> Yeah , but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy <gap> . <gap> yeah . Now that was one thing that we brought up over email . I don't know if you picked up your email , Yeah . but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . Right . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it <disfmarker> it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . Mm-hmm . So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss <disfmarker> But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . It's really <disfmarker> Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ? Do you think that would be conceptually possible ? I think it would be difficult technologically , I think <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , Mm . s so it's <disfmarker> I'm not quite sure how it would work That's true , mm 'kay . Yeah . and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . Mm-hmm . Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we <disfmarker> so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . Okay 'cause <disfmarker> well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um <disfmarker> So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? Um . I feel like this is simil <vocalsound> or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat . Mm-hmm . But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on <vocalsound> . Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ? Mm yeah , Ah , Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah . that's good , that's good . there we go . Here , stick it on . <vocalsound> Put an extra the button on <gap> <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sure . Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ? Well do we w <vocalsound> like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . Oh okay . Okay . That was <vocalsound> <disfmarker> So where <disfmarker> I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me <disfmarker> I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . Okay . <vocalsound> Do you need this or just write on the white board ? No , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing , Okay . 'cause I think it would be redundant . Right . Okay . I dunno . It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , <vocalsound> Ooh . you know , <vocalsound> Cool . <vocalsound> kinda push it <vocalsound> . Hey . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Maybe a little smaller than that <gap> . No , <vocalsound> I kinda like it . That's hard to miss . It makes look more fruity as well . <vocalsound> Oh it does , it's kind of like <disfmarker> It's like a deformed foot , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> I dunno . <vocalsound> There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem . <vocalsound> Like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers <gap> . Yeah . Yeah . Interesting . I like this one . Okay , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? Variety of colours are nice . I like the idea of the <disfmarker> I think I'm leaning towards the potato . I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . Mm-hmm . I am worried about like um using a menu . Um in that <disfmarker> like i withing menus there are submenus , Hmm . and so how do you get back to the main menu ? Yeah . Well that <disfmarker> on the iPod , for example , you just <disfmarker> every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level . But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ? Yeah . Good point . This is , it's <disfmarker> the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . Okay . You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh . <gap> <vocalsound> Could these be used for going to submenus Yeah . Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah . <vocalsound> Maybe <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> yeah , maybe it can be one of those , Okay . if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something . Mm-hmm . Okay . Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , mm 'kay . Okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that <disfmarker> The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ? Potato . <vocalsound> I think so . Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . Okay . So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . Okay . So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . Okay . So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . So like in my opinion the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion . Yeah . What does <vocalsound> each of you <disfmarker> I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . Okay , well give it a number , Okay . sorry <vocalsound> . I will give it a one . Um I dunno if it's it's creative . I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . I dunno if any of them are fancy in <disfmarker> I'd say two , because c unique . Okay . And two , I'll go for two . awesome . Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one . Yeah , one . One ? I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two . Okay . Um functional . I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , um , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . Okay . Well there's some other ones , I will address that , yeah . Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two . Awesome , okay . Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative . Did you give a functional <gap> ? Yeah , she said it was one . Okay . Um is it technologically innovative ? Mm . Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really <disfmarker> Well , the kinetic battery . <vocalsound> In the battery , that's it . I kinetic battery is a big one , so . How many people would notice that , though ? Mm . But it <disfmarker> But they'll notice it after like a year , but we know it's there . they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery . And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . Mm . Just the material . I'll give it a three . 'Cause it <disfmarker> we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really <disfmarker> Yeah . I I would say that it's <disfmarker> Yeah , like fancy versus creative it's it's different . But does that equal innovative ? I dunno . I'll give it a three . Alright . Everyone else ? I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's it's just <disfmarker> it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four . Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . Mm 'kay . I really like that kinetic battery though . Next , is it easy to use ? Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , Mm 'kay . so don't overlap them . Okay . I think it's really easy to use . I'll give it a two . Um I'll give it a one . Pretty hard to mess up . I'll say one . <vocalsound> Uh let's say two . Alright . Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I <disfmarker> it's spongy all the way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Give it a one . Yeah . Yeah . I wonder if it bounces when you drop it . Ooh , Mm-hmm . that you couldn't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it'd be harder to break , harder to lose . <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah . 'Cause there would be less impact maybe , <vocalsound> . Iain , what do you give it ? Mm . Yeah I'd I'd give it a one . Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables <vocalsound> ? <vocalsound> Uh um <vocalsound> . Well , is it gonna be yellow ? It it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ? That's right , yeah , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in <disfmarker> Yeah . We might wanna keep it yellow . um well if we <disfmarker> I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in <disfmarker> and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . <gap> Yeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something . Yeah . Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? If we had a yellow <disfmarker> Sure . Okay . Oh , Yeah . yeah . Alright , so Fruity , so fruity . So <vocalsound> I think it it's <disfmarker> it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity . Yeah . I think i it's kind of mangoey too . <vocalsound> Oh , mango Yeah . Mangoey is better , yeah . I <disfmarker> okay , Yes . that that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I'm giving it a one <vocalsound> I like mangoes <vocalsound> . the mango <gap> put me over . Mm . That's a much more trendy than a potato <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What are <disfmarker> what's everyone's numbers ? one . Uh two . One . <vocalsound> Alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one . Mm-hmm . Yeah , me too . Uh one . Did you say one , Rose ? Yes . Okay um , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . It's gonna be hard . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but um <disfmarker> Um um worth the risk , I think . I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two . Yeah . I'll I'll say two as well . Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , Mm . 'Kay . but <disfmarker> Yeah I'll I'll say two . <vocalsound> Alright , awesome . And the ease of learning it . I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , I dunno . It sort of reminds me of the iPod . I just got mine , I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay , so <disfmarker> Mm . and I'm not good at learning technology . So I'll give it a two . The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . Mm-hmm . So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , Oh , good point . Mm-hmm . but once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . So I'd I'd give it a four . Okay . I think I'd give it a four too . It's a pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We we <disfmarker> I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , Okay , so but <disfmarker> in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still <disfmarker> if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . Mm I'd give it a four . Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . Small too . Alright , we also said simplicity , <vocalsound> how w how well does it address just being simple ? Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ? I think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . <vocalsound> Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . Right . Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two . I'm <gap> give it a three I guess . I'll give it a two . Three . Alright , and fashionable ? It's totally fashionable . It's hot , <vocalsound> I'd give it a one . <vocalsound> I mean it's a mango , come on . Mango . <vocalsound> I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . <vocalsound> I dunno . <vocalsound> I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote I do like uh the little Martian one . <vocalsound> or alien or whatever he was . Yeah , the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Number . Um two . Three . One . And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? Just that it would se serve our audience . I don't see why not . Mm-hmm . I think as long <disfmarker> if we offer in a <disfmarker> in at least three different colour arrangements . Um yeah , that's good . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So I'll give it a a two <gap> . Yeah , I'll say two . Alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . Shall we uh <disfmarker> Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ . All of them should have R_R_ , yeah . And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . fine . Okay . That's me . Lovely . Okay , now we're gonna look at finances . Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um , so let me exit out of this first . Okay um <disfmarker> Whoa . Oh my . <vocalsound> I know . Let me <gap> one more space . Gonna zoom in real quick . <gap> Okay . Hand dynamo . We're using kinetic battery , Uh we're n using kinetic , yeah . right ? Um and we're having one per <disfmarker> Yeah . One , okay . Um electronics . Single . Simple , simple rather . Simple . Simple . Mm 'kay . Um the case . Uh uh uh double-curved . Guess it's double-curved . It is pretty curvy . Yeah . It's very curvy , so okay . <gap> Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know . Our case material supplements <disfmarker> oops , we just skipped by them . Well don't we need plastic , and <disfmarker> No , we we <disfmarker> the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . Provided , okay . The supplement is <disfmarker> The wood ? Oh , I guess it was rubber rather than latex . I mean the rubber . It was rubber and special colour , right ? Yeah . Mm-hmm , okay . Do we have more than one special colour ? Yeah , Uh well <disfmarker> we're using <disfmarker> we're gonna need at least two special colours . Special colours , isn't it ? Um . I don't know what the se the basic colour is though . Per <disfmarker> I dunno where it <disfmarker> yeah . Well , but we know that we're having at least three colours , So let's y say three . so <disfmarker> Well , are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , we'll <disfmarker> like we'll have yellow and black . Is that two special colours ? Yeah , I dunno . Or or is white and black , then two more or <vocalsound> <disfmarker> That I thi I thought that would be under yours . Uh . I guess it's three , We'll just say three . three three <gap> . Mm-hmm . Right . Alright . Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , so yeah . Interface , we're doing push buttons . Yeah . And how many buttons do we have ? We have six . We've got five <gap> . Oh Six , with the power . no , Oh <gap> Six . five . six . <gap> Yeah . Anything else ? No . Oh , we'll <disfmarker> do we wa Are the buttons in special colour , special f I didn't get information on <disfmarker> Oh wait . Oh , buttons <disfmarker> oh , so um . So the case material will just have one colour , right , but then the buttons will be in special colours ? Well , Yeah . does it <disfmarker> but if we're making multiple varieties of <disfmarker> this is where I'm getting confused . We're saying per unit . <gap> per unit , okay , okay . Yeah , per unit . Okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their <disfmarker> Alright , and each button s but the case is <disfmarker> could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . Yeah . Yeah . I like it like that . Yeah , okay . So <disfmarker> Special form ? They're all kind of just push button , No , I think they're fine . right ? Yeah . Special material ? Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah . Uh . Oh do <disfmarker> I have to do it per button , do I ? No , I don't think so . I think they're <disfmarker> if they're all gonna be rubber then it <disfmarker> that's what it matters . Okay . Yeah , 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , Yeah . Yeah . 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . Mm-hmm . Yeah . It's <disfmarker> I mean it's two to make it rubber . Okay . Oh wait , so maybe . <gap> Thirteen point seven . Oh oh . Yeah , what can we reduce ? Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour . Mm , I kind of like the buttons . Let's see what that would do . It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway . <vocalsound> Alright . Okay um , Uh . are we sure this is double-curved ? Maybe it's single-curved , We have no idea . we have no idea . I dunno , I didn't get any pictures . <vocalsound> It's single curved . It's single curved . Why not ? Well it's not the <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve , <vocalsound> case material is rubber and it's a special colour , Yeah . but that's important . That is important . Six buttons <disfmarker> we have to have six buttons . How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ? What ? It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen . No , okay , maybe not . I don't know what just happened . Now it's twelve . We <vocalsound> What was our target price again ? Twelve point five . Twelve point five . Hey hey . Twelve point five . So we're just just about there . So we're okay , I think . We're all set then . Yeah . <gap> Ish . Okay , we're all set . Alright . Um save . I saved that to our um our big shared folder , so you know . Um okay , back to agenda . <vocalsound> Um are the <disfmarker> are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? Yes . Yes . Yeah , they are . Yeah . Let's move on to the project evaluation . Project process . Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the <disfmarker> how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard . <vocalsound> Well . Okay . I felt very creative . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think we've been successful I enjoyed making the prototypes . in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set <gap> Yeah . and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got <gap> cost . I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , Mm-hmm . how many colours , what do colours count Mm-hmm . things , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well . Um I think we worked together pretty well . Yeah . Yeah , I mean <vocalsound> if I'd had more market research on the <gap> fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah <gap> . <vocalsound> But the fruits and vegetables , they really <gap> my creativity , so . <vocalsound> I know , I really did , the the whole mango idea was great . <vocalsound> Do you think we could <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , I mean I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . That was a bit of a distraction . Yeah . That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to , so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think we all made um very significant contributions , I don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over , um <disfmarker> Yeah . I like our little finished products . <vocalsound> Can we market this as the mango remote ? <vocalsound> They're funny . Really cute . <vocalsound> I kind of want one . <vocalsound> Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? I have a little R_R_ . I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there <gap> . <vocalsound> I know , let's think of it like a little jingle . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in . Yes . Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget . All thanks to Iain for the design of that one . <gap> . Okay um Mm . What did we find for new ideas ? new ideas found ? People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . Definitely . Yeah . Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . etcetera . Oh , I'm so excited . <vocalsound> Yeah , That was <disfmarker> I didn't even know they existed . I I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist . Mm-hmm . But in other things , I think it'd be really good . I thi yeah , that's awesome . Um okay , closing . Are the costs within the budget ? Is the project evaluated ? Yes . Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . Um so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three Yeah . which we hope um <disfmarker> yeah . Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah , Real Reaction . <vocalsound> I do like the Martian remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . Oh , that would definitely be my second choice . Mm . Although the tog toggle <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm afraid I would <disfmarker> That's cool . Let's all let's all go for the yellow <gap> <disfmarker> I would break it . <vocalsound> I would break it . It's cool . <vocalsound> It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem I think I would break it . Break the stem off . and then <vocalsound> <disfmarker> alright , so <disfmarker> Oh that's funny <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is <disfmarker> it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh Kind of looks like a penguin , like <vocalsound> with no eye <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Take me to your leader . <vocalsound> yeah , it's kind of a penguin . <gap> I like that it stands up . Mm-mm . Wow , maybe I should market it to some remote control company now . <vocalsound> So are are <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That was bound to happen <vocalsound> Oh , sad . poor little thing . <vocalsound> Mm 'kay , congratulations . Um . Anything else to say ? Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , Alright . its all timed . Oh . Um anybody have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> I got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ? <vocalsound> It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but check it out . So like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But all that you need to keep in mind your <gap> knowledge management . Um just wanna make sure you do . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and I was like why did she send this to us ? <vocalsound> Oh <gap> <vocalsound> It's very it's very work relevant , 'cause people send spam a lot . It is . Yes definitely <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Let's see , I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website . Oh <gap> . here you can you can view . what did I get through the corporate website ? It's just inspiration about circuit boards . You can just see what's up . Wow . Yeah it's it's really deep . Hold on . Takes a little while to get excited to load . That <disfmarker> the Excel thing is pretty cool . Yes . Yeah , that is pretty neat . Here , I love Excel , like , basically it's one of my favourite programs . it's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing , see . You didn't miss out that much . I see , mm . Yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . Spongy . I learned a lot actually . Mm . Oh wow . I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to . This one was cooler . I got a whole table and everything . Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and <disfmarker> I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this <disfmarker> you just need to talk about the case . That's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? And then it didn't have like any kind of table , like awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result <vocalsound> . It's really interesting though . I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . We had a lot of the um <disfmarker> I think . Yeah . otherwise the technology <gap> today was kinda cool . That was really neat how I got emails We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much . and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . No . No . Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> yeah . If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up , but <disfmarker> Mm . 'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . Yeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . Mm-hmm . But I thought we were good orally . Get crazy . I think if you had a larger group <disfmarker> And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint Yeah . Yeah . as that's not as necessary to have . And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , Mm . 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . Mm-hmm . <gap> Because we're all gonna be working in different places . Yeah . We <disfmarker> if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , Mm-hmm . but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess . Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? Uh we we worked together , Yeah . um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , Mm-hmm . um and how we could like improve on the on the design . Yeah . So it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , Mm-hmm . and then just went from there really . Cool . It was fun . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So well done with the management , I felt well managed . Oh thanks . I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , It's kinda fun . and second we actually we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . Mm . Sorry . <vocalsound> And I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That happened to me all the time though . I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . Mm-hmm . But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points <gap> at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there . Yeah , I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting <disfmarker> we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , Mm-hmm . but we were able to do it regardless , so . I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . This is what we'll do . Yeah . I found that we did <disfmarker> we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . Yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah . Especially last time , Mm-hmm . yeah . Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . you know what I mean , Yeah . like we we couldn't answer every single question . Yeah . Right . <vocalsound> Um but <disfmarker> And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , and not sort of Mm . made me really like , ooh I don't know <vocalsound> , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . I had so much information and so much to talk about . It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the <disfmarker> when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentation even . Yeah . Mm . Um . I'm a little <disfmarker> I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a <disfmarker> um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point . Yeah . <gap> that was something like <disfmarker> in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and <vocalsound> things like <disfmarker> About <disfmarker> yeah . Well the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included , Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . so there was no <disfmarker> we could be like yeah , it has it included . I think we were <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . There was no way for us to have Considered the re written down that it was really there . Yeah . yeah . I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Well it's interesting that they <disfmarker> I think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me , Mm-hmm , yeah <gap> . but <disfmarker> It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um <disfmarker> we weren't provided with information to discuss that . Yeah . Yeah . I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , Yeah . Yeah . but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that <disfmarker> I just don't know what it is , I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them . but <disfmarker> Mm . I dunno . I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever Hmm . 'cause there's only one T_V_ and there's only like three chairs . That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway . You'll lose 'em in your pocket , like you just will forget that <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , Mm . there's always ways to lose things . Yeah . It d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but <disfmarker> Yeah , or like I guess what the setup of the house is too . Mm-hmm . But , I mean <disfmarker> I am notorious for losing my keys , I just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I guess I've just never lost the remote . I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night <vocalsound> and couldn't find them . <vocalsound> 'Cause I was putting groceries away . That's funny . <vocalsound> Oh . You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room . Can't get in . <vocalsound> Can't get in , look all around the kitchen . Definitely in the vegetable drawer . <vocalsound> That's funny . So <vocalsound> . I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat . Mm . Yep . But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much . Yeah . Can't really take it into the other room . Yeah . Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a <disfmarker> robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh a G_P_S_ system , <vocalsound> internal G_P_S_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh man . Here you go . <vocalsound> We should make one that walks by itself . <vocalsound> Although if it's sitting still for too long . <vocalsound> Yes I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That really could get up and walk away <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <gap> Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there . <vocalsound> Or little <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or just just a wheel , you know . <vocalsound> Just if you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can <gap> . <gap> zoom <disfmarker> Yeah . Hmm . All kinds of possibilities . Mm . Okay . Sorry , I'm just um trying to update my minutes . I decided to <disfmarker> you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . Yeah . Just gonna make <disfmarker> I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . Oh . Wow . 'Cause that seems a little more useful . 'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do . But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so <disfmarker> Yeah , I guess <disfmarker> How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting . Most of it , mm-hmm . I added slides , um I added a couple slides each time , Oh . but that was about it . Okay . Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all Mm . in w didn't even think about adding more . Well , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . Ah yeah. . And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point . <gap> I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so <disfmarker> I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three . Right . You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like <disfmarker> The slogan on it ? No , no , definitely not . No no no . Okay good . We <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'Cause I was like , it could go around the outside . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , I don't think we need to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one . I think we just need the um the R_R_ , yeah . Is it yellow and blue ? Or yellow and blue . Lemme go to the web page . Yeah , I was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or <gap> . Oh I guess it is black , grey . Grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish . I don't really like yellow in general . Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings . But it <disfmarker> Finish meeting now . <vocalsound> <gap> Wasn't it interesting that um <disfmarker> I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> the marketing choices , you know , like <vocalsound> I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , <vocalsound> that was a bit of a conflict . <vocalsound> it's kind of an <disfmarker> they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence <gap> like we did a survey , this is what people said . <vocalsound> Yeah . S mm , I dunno . People are stupid . I guess it i it sort of a grey , isn't it ? Yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue . Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we're good . Yeah . Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway . Maybe , like <disfmarker> I don't know . <gap> That could always be <gap> . Well we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so <vocalsound> . Oh . If they ever come out with potato <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Potato mango shaped remotes . I'm gonna have to <disfmarker> I'm claiming it intellectual property . <vocalsound> Yeah . I can't believe a whole day is gone . I know . I don't feel like it's been that long . Get sucked in . Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet .
Here we go again . <vocalsound> My mouse is not working anymore . <vocalsound> Oh . Oh . <vocalsound> He's uh <disfmarker> Okay . when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep . Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I got like this big black border uh on every side . <vocalsound> Okay . Mm , okay . <vocalsound> I'll I'll fix it . Everybody ready ? Yeah , it's okay . Yeah , whatever . Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh this is the agenda , the opening . Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . We have uh forty minutes . Yes . Oh , well this is the <vocalsound> the closing already . <vocalsound> So uh <disfmarker> well we start off with the th the first presentation then . Uh , I think um in uh <disfmarker> we have to do it in uh in right order . Okay . Maybe the <disfmarker> I don't know what the right order is . So <disfmarker> Well , it <disfmarker> No . Huh . Oh that . It won't <disfmarker> doesn't <disfmarker> Maybe we should start with the the technical functions . Okay , how can I get this on the whiteboard ? Yeah ? Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . In project . Okay , I've done that . You've already done that ? No can that open . Yes . Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one . Open it there . Uh , well . Yes . Uh-oh . New thing . Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time . Mm-hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> About the get <disfmarker> And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too . 'Kay , we're going to um uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television . Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology . Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh <disfmarker> a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um , Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um <disfmarker> Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's <disfmarker> it is uh <disfmarker> can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it's all very uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh , Okay . and it's not uh very specialised uh technology . <vocalsound> I haven't come to here , but um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control . <vocalsound> Yes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . Oh . Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then . <vocalsound> What ? Okay . But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? <vocalsound> No . It's gonna be easy ? Yes . Okay . But nothing restricted for user interface ? Yeah . M With technical <disfmarker> Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah . I don't know . Okay . 'Kay . Remote control is nothing special nowadays . R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter . Okay . Um <disfmarker> But I kind of uh <disfmarker> I don't think so , Okay . Yeah , <gap> okay . because of the <disfmarker> all the televisions uh <disfmarker> there are a few <disfmarker> maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , Yes . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ? Well , we'll see . We'll see later on . Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , No . but uh I got these two , No . and I think they're <disfmarker> we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user . <vocalsound> th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? Yeah , but it <disfmarker> I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control . <vocalsound> The ones I <disfmarker> I've uh received from the account manager . Yeah . Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh <disfmarker> yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it . Uh-huh . Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . <gap> we should we should choose one uh <disfmarker> we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yes , I agree . Yeah . Yeah ? Well , what <disfmarker> that's what you want <disfmarker> trying to say . Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and <disfmarker> we have to choose for novice user . Okay . Okay . But I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use . Yeah , well <vocalsound> some of these <disfmarker> Uh , yeah . Well , some of that will <disfmarker> Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements . Yeah , probably , yeah . Yes . So <disfmarker> Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . Mm-hmm . And from that on we can <gap> user requirements what we need more . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy <disfmarker> the trends in the markets , Yes . and I don't know if there uh are any um <disfmarker> uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . <vocalsound> I haven't really found a conclusion like that . M you can just <vocalsound> you can k <vocalsound> you can keep it in mind that . Yeah . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the <disfmarker> with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh <disfmarker> Design . yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think . Sounds interesting . Yeah ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think . Okay . Yeah , that was it . <vocalsound> Alright . Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market . <vocalsound> Yes . <gap> . Yeah . It's alright . Um <disfmarker> Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um <disfmarker> yes . The working method um <vocalsound> there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , <vocalsound> three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . <vocalsound> Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um , <vocalsound> relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got <disfmarker> we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um <vocalsound> an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . So , <vocalsound> what I was thinking <disfmarker> oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them uh on one button and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh <disfmarker> there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh <disfmarker> yeah , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . Okay . <vocalsound> And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say <disfmarker> Visually presents . Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh <disfmarker> consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . That was kind of what I found . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Well , then we <disfmarker> I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . <vocalsound> Yes . Uh , well some of the uh new requirements <vocalsound> make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think . <vocalsound> Because um uh s decided to put <disfmarker> They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . Well , now I see four . Two ? <vocalsound> That's kinda strange . Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No uh , I agree , I agree . It's impossible , I think . No way . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special <disfmarker> put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or <disfmarker> Not too much , no . You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . Yeah . So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . I don't know . I think that uh that's what they're trying to say . <vocalsound> Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . Mm-hmm . But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market . Yeah , but it is <disfmarker> it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . Mayb yeah ? Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , <vocalsound> you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's what the problem is . <vocalsound> Okay . We haven't got remote controls for uh <disfmarker> Well I think , yeah . Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's <disfmarker> Not too much then , bu alright . no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . Yes . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , <vocalsound> something else nice to know . But what's our slogan ? Sorry ? Yeah , <vocalsound> you will have to look that up . <vocalsound> The slogan uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I'll have a look . <vocalsound> We put the fashion in electronics . I think it's something about the <disfmarker> Puts fashion in electronics . <vocalsound> Oh , okay . <vocalsound> I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sense simplicity . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sense and simplicity . <vocalsound> Okay well , <vocalsound> let's go back to the the agenda . So we've now had to <disfmarker> the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements . That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the <disfmarker> maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh <disfmarker> yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . Yeah . Yeah . I think we can implement more functions then , because um <vocalsound> basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology Yeah , but wha and therefore will be a more <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , But <disfmarker> because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger <disfmarker> Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . Well , ma Yeah . So why should j we put this function in ? <vocalsound> Well , I think <disfmarker> I think more <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think uh people <disfmarker> younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions . But I think uh you <disfmarker> we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have <disfmarker> Y Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . Yes . You can uh , know , you <gap> you can <vocalsound> make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was <disfmarker> that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , you know , they want to uh Yeah , control . Yeah , but uh you said <disfmarker> control , remotely . Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . <vocalsound> No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the <disfmarker> The new project requirements told us not to <disfmarker> It's n Yeah . But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other <disfmarker> maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , <gap> or n what d what do you guys think ? But you can put them under the same button . Not much more than that . Yep . Yeah , if <disfmarker> as far as possible . Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . So t But what do you think ? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that <disfmarker> to control other devices ? No . <vocalsound> No , you don't think so ? No , new requirements say no . Yeah , the new requirements say so . So <disfmarker> But you can put a play and stop and and rewind . Well , maybe it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . Yeah , but <disfmarker> You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with <disfmarker> Yes , but we <disfmarker> Y yes . I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th <vocalsound> with lot more functions . <vocalsound> Yep , exactly . That's that's wha But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , No no , you don't <vocalsound> <disfmarker> No no , you don't need it . No , no . No , no . Exactly . Huh . just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward . Okay , but we have to think uh <disfmarker> w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , Yeah , I know , but uh <disfmarker> so um but uh from my experience it's kinda <vocalsound> a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . Mm , yeah . It's c sometimes a bit difficult . Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh <disfmarker> Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . <vocalsound> Yes . Yeah , but just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> keep it simple and look more at th And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . No . It's only for television . So <disfmarker> Okay . Yes , but there are there are <disfmarker> It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , nothing more . Exactly . Okay . Alright . Um , but what televis But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh <disfmarker> dozens of of remote controls that have <disfmarker> Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And simple . <vocalsound> The user interface is easy . Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels . And the basic <disfmarker> yeah , basic functions , yeah . <vocalsound> Yes , definitely , yeah . Uh , It's too much integrated in the other . Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off . Yeah . Probably . Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not <disfmarker> nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , Oh , okay . then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . <vocalsound> Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it <vocalsound> quite often . Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And Will you look <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we have to <disfmarker> well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . Look at the market . We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . Well <disfmarker> I don't know what you th guys think . Might be . Might be . Yeah , I <disfmarker> uh , it's <gap> <disfmarker> <gap> Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but do you like to have a <disfmarker> such a s stop button ? Or do you think it uh <disfmarker> I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function . Well , uh when you uh uh <disfmarker> when you look uh <disfmarker> for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the <disfmarker> for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th Yeah . Okay , it goes <disfmarker> Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why <vocalsound> it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements . Yes , but you could put Yeah , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . If you have seven pages , you can go up and down . Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using <disfmarker> Yes . True . I think we should just put one teletext button on it . Then we meet uh the new requirements . we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess . A simple <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ? Or do we <disfmarker> uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , Yes . Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also . But trendy , yeah . yep . I don't know . Or maybe you should place them on a <disfmarker> uh , in a special way ? Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick . Yeah , something or uh <vocalsound> somethin special way to to zap through the <disfmarker> it has to <vocalsound> s it has to be <vocalsound> <disfmarker> yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly . Original . It was uh <disfmarker> Yep . <vocalsound> If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . True . Yeah , and it <disfmarker> the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid <disfmarker> at a rapid pace . Yes . Oh , what should we decide on then ? I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then . But <disfmarker> Yeah . No , it's o just signals uh <disfmarker> and the television d uh does the rest . Yep . Maybe uh <disfmarker> No , okay , but we don't have to <disfmarker> uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . No . Uh maybe we <disfmarker> uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries . The most standard batteries . I think I think that we should use uh d I think double A_ . Yeah ? <vocalsound> yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind Yep . <gap> <disfmarker> th the most uh <disfmarker> Well , it has to be simple , and I wi Yeah . The most ordinary uh batteries . Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know . Okay . Yep . Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? <vocalsound> I think about twenty minutes . M m m more than thirty minutes ? Uh ten twenty minutes . But i in a way we have to be uh uh special . <vocalsound> Well , uh these these shouldn't <disfmarker> Early break . Yeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's <disfmarker> Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can <disfmarker> what the extra touch can be . Maybe th m Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or <disfmarker> Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . <vocalsound> I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh <vocalsound> ten to twelve or whatever . <vocalsound> To find him . That's maybe <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I don't know . I don't know . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i <gap> has something nice . Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep . Yeah . Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should <vocalsound> <disfmarker> or an <disfmarker> or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . Yeah . It's gonna cost twenty five Euros . <vocalsound> Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . <vocalsound> Yeah , but the <disfmarker> well , it's already been done . Yeah , but that's <disfmarker> yeah . Nah . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's true . But <disfmarker> and I think it's gonna be uh very uh <disfmarker> it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . Yes . <gap> it has to be used something special , Yeah . Yep . and you really <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know . No , that's true . So maybe uh that's i I think that's <vocalsound> when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it . Be original , yeah . Uh , also for you maybe , when t you <disfmarker> it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend <disfmarker> use friendly as well , you know . Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah . So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Must brain-storm . Uh-huh . Yeah , a swapable front or whatever . Yeah , or just different colours would be uh <disfmarker> I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . Well <disfmarker> For the remote control . <vocalsound> It could be be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Why not ? Yeah , you never know , but <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> More money for us . <vocalsound> But it <disfmarker> and I think we have to make it quite big . Yeah . Quite big . Yeah , you think ? Yes , definitely , definitely . Yeah , That's to be uh a formed for your hand . <gap> people <disfmarker> So , and and also because uh it is expensive . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions <gap> <vocalsound> want to be <disfmarker> you don't want to get it l make it <disfmarker> Yes , it <disfmarker> it it should be f <vocalsound> be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o Mm-hmm . And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh <vocalsound> A standard or something . <disfmarker> yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah . Yeah , you have to put it on its <disfmarker> So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . A face ? Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah . <gap> no no , <gap> put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something <gap> <disfmarker> More like a joystick then . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep . It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that . Yeah yeah , but <disfmarker> yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in <disfmarker> If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . That it's it's fashionable . <vocalsound> <gap> I <gap> I don't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . Oh , yeah . That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second <disfmarker> Uh fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . Yeah , but but when you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it <disfmarker> No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in . <vocalsound> Oh , okay . On the television . Oh , like this . <vocalsound> Uh , that's kind of nice . If an <disfmarker> a button in in that uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or you can <disfmarker> And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable . <vocalsound> A char <vocalsound> chargeable . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , that w yeah , but <disfmarker> yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't <disfmarker> Yeah . Why not . Maybe you , but <vocalsound> we don't know much about production cost , but when you <disfmarker> you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money <disfmarker> there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , <gap> rechargeable units . With recharger . <vocalsound> It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ? Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So , it's not gonna be that expen Production . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . <vocalsound> It should be possible . Uh I I think it's a great idea . I think it's a good idea . Yeah . S some kind of be To make a base or something ? I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays . Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah . Yes , but is that handy ? Well , I <disfmarker> well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one <gap> . It's it's it's it's And uh you can always find your remote control up <disfmarker> But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries . it's not the purpose to be handy , it's Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could <disfmarker> when that's <disfmarker> when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , And then you <disfmarker> but you will <disfmarker> you do need uh also an <disfmarker> uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda <disfmarker> Yes . Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . Or <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah , but that's not <disfmarker> it's ugly , I think . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah . I don't know . Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . No . On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still <vocalsound> still put a bleep function in it , <vocalsound> Yeah . but um I think the bay is definitely uh <disfmarker> I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um <disfmarker> Well , we uh <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . We can save on the on the functions . We just <vocalsound> put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , Sure , why not . Yep . it's also nice . And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to <disfmarker> we uh <disfmarker> that's uh <disfmarker> Yeah . it's not a easy market . Yeah . We have to something special . Yeah . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , True . Yeah . and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , Definitely . because we aren't gonna put <disfmarker> With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely . Yeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this <gap> <disfmarker> and then you also you got the stand-up thing . Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have . Yeah . Definitely , yeah . Oh , if it <disfmarker> let's <disfmarker> well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . Yeah . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . And the first thing we <disfmarker> the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that . Yeah , we c But it would be nice . <vocalsound> It would be nice , yes . It's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo <gap> <disfmarker> I've experienced that that <disfmarker> Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so <vocalsound> yes . Yeah , okay . So , easy functions . Well , we will we will <disfmarker> I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down . Yeah , why not . Yeah . But it's also annoying . <vocalsound> <gap> 'cause as long as it stays <disfmarker> as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . Hmm . Yeah . <gap> true . Then it beeps all the time and <gap> . No , that's true . You don't want to have <disfmarker> ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable <gap> . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma Why not . <vocalsound> But you pay for it . Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look <disfmarker> get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of <disfmarker> they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , Yeah . I think it's brilliant . Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I've never <disfmarker> it's so simple , but I've never seen it . Yeah . No . Nearly . And you can leave it just there . M maybe we should really <vocalsound> do this . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> <vocalsound> Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't uh synched . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> Oh , now I've put uh <disfmarker> well , <gap> it is twenty p Yeah , I'll <disfmarker> Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ? Something like that , yeah . Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think . Uh fifteen minutes . We've decided on the functions . Well , there is some <disfmarker> oh . There is a closing sheet . We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . <vocalsound> Oh . Oh <vocalsound> okay , I'll make sure <disfmarker> I'll <disfmarker> I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . <vocalsound> We'll see . I think these are more important than the first ones , so <disfmarker> Can you make an uh uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? <gap> . That not not everything in one one uh folder . Maarten , five minutes . Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh <disfmarker> the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones <gap> well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do <disfmarker> put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get <disfmarker> it's not working <vocalsound> when you try to write second uh paper or something . Yeah . Maybe . No , that's true uh , yeah . And then you <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen . Should we by the way draw um <gap> this kind of looks you like . on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of <disfmarker> Of the shape . yeah . Or the sh Yeah , probably , it would be nice . I dunno . Has anyone got um <vocalsound> a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? <vocalsound> Do you get an idea of the shape ? I don't , for one . Maybe like this pen . A bit bigger I guess , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , bigger . A little bit bigger , yeah but <disfmarker> The shape is nice , it's um something different , and we want we want that . It has to feel nice in your hand . Well , I I <vocalsound> I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , Yeah . <vocalsound> or I think some <disfmarker> maybe we should <disfmarker> no , that will be too costly . Oh , uh look <disfmarker> uh look at the pictures . We shou we could also , that was a <disfmarker> would also be an idea , but I don't think it <disfmarker> I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it . <vocalsound> Okay , yeah . That would also be nice . But that's gonna <disfmarker> then you c then you don't Yeah , but <vocalsound> twelve and a half Euros ? Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it <disfmarker> that's not something i that's in the production cost <disfmarker> <gap> a one <disfmarker> it's a one time , you know <disfmarker> s was <disfmarker> it's a single cost . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , m but but then you can <disfmarker> nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . Yeah , that's true . Would be a nice idea though . I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r <gap> it has to have round forms or something . Like something like that or so or so Something like that is very ergonomic . And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round . So <disfmarker> Put it in there uh <gap> wire on it . <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well . <gap> Yeah , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that . Volume and programme , yeah . Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part . And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers . Yeah . Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess . Yeah . And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of <disfmarker> no , no , you have to <gap> <disfmarker> Maybe on the side of it . Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry . Yeah , side of it . Along the side uh strip of <disfmarker> yeah . Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah . Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote . Oh . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Well , theys have to be <disfmarker> Well , uh probably at the side . You know look at the front , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just <gap> like that . Yeah , exactly , And then you have a strip of uh lights or something and then there is <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , something like that , yeah . Okay , yeah . Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . <gap> maybe put something on top of it <vocalsound> or , you know , like that's <disfmarker> looks funny . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> I don't know . Or some bump . I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . Maybe some <disfmarker> Yeah ? Bumper or something . We'll have to think about it . I think we're we're done . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yes , we are . We can save this one . <vocalsound> Alright . Lunch break . Yes , I guess it's lunch time . Okay then . Mm mm . <gap> <vocalsound> I don't know . <gap> <gap> Half and hour ? I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour . Okay , five <gap> uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that was what uh <disfmarker> I don't know about the lunch break . Mm , we'll hear about it . Well <disfmarker> Oh <gap> . <gap> . <vocalsound>
Uh fourth meeting . <vocalsound> We have to do what ? <vocalsound> W what ? Alri alright . We'll see . Some extra deciding . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Oh . <gap> I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting . <vocalsound> Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype . Yeah . Then um <disfmarker> I guess that's your bit ? Yeah . I I didn't s see anything about it , so <vocalsound> I already uh thought you uh you were <gap> to do that . <vocalsound> So the you're uh <gap> . <vocalsound> I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design . Mm . Yeah , that's important too . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bit late . <vocalsound> And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close . Alright . Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh <vocalsound> I'll show you the notes . <vocalsound> I don't think it's very interesting . <vocalsound> I think it is . Oh nei . Uh no . <vocalsound> Alright . This is copy paste . So <disfmarker> From me of course , yeah . Of course . You had some very strange layout . Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's a nice chorus , yeah . <vocalsound> Well um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We ge we went through the agenda , <vocalsound> and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . Repeat it yeah . Alright . So uh <disfmarker> This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that . Okay . And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . Alright , we both uh will ? Yeah . Or one of us will ? <vocalsound> Alright . Uh <disfmarker> No you go and I'll uh supplement you . Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Correct . <vocalsound> Right . Uh well <vocalsound> this is our design . Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um <vocalsound> which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . <vocalsound> Um then we have uh the lower part <vocalsound> of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , Mm . uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . Yeah , it's a double R_ , but <disfmarker> Yeah ? It's a double R_ . It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo <disfmarker> But <vocalsound> it's very difficult to to draw that in <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , Yeah , alright . but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . Okay . Yeah . Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round <disfmarker> I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . Oval yeah . Alright . So <gap> uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m Channel up and volume ? Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh <vocalsound> uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And then we've here the Menu button and the <disfmarker> Alright . Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . And the video button . The <disfmarker> Mm right . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . 'Kay . Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . Well if I look at it , the side the side view <disfmarker> Well , at the back <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk Yeah . and then you can add suggestions . Oh yeah alright . Yeah <gap> . Maybe I I don't want to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . <gap> Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh <disfmarker> Yeah the back . Yeah . <vocalsound> We thought about <disfmarker> Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . <vocalsound> And we thought about the logo big in the middle . Mm-hmm . Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back . Mm-hmm . Maybe that's too much Okay . but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . No I don't think <disfmarker> And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . And the <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . That's basically what we were thinking about , <vocalsound> and <disfmarker> Okay . And about the side view um <disfmarker> This the front won't be as thick , W <vocalsound> but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh <disfmarker> Well I see , but <disfmarker> Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , Well . Yeah I see it . the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . Yes . And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . <vocalsound> When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible . Well , it won't be visible . Mm ? If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But <disfmarker> Why ? <vocalsound> Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , <vocalsound> mean uh the the the the <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , I agree . Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . <gap> If y <vocalsound> If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . <vocalsound> In the middle in the <disfmarker> You you have it a bit uh <disfmarker> Yeah . It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it . And how large is it ? Yeah . Yeah , that's the question . That's the question . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh well <disfmarker> Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? <gap> This was Mike's prototype , <vocalsound> Well uh <disfmarker> and y you seemed to agreed on it . But now you have a totally different <gap> . Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh <gap> ? Well , they lay there all the time . The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean <disfmarker> They the the the the the side view , Side ? Uh oh the side ? we didn't uh <disfmarker> W we we he drew the s the side , Yeah yeah . but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea <gap> . Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . Yeah . <vocalsound> But you you hold it like this . Yeah you you don't you don't grab it , You're not holding it like this or something . you you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Well y y y you don't have it like this . You have it more like this . No no no . <vocalsound> <gap> You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way . Like you're holding your telephone . Yep . Yeah . So you <disfmarker> Yeah . So <disfmarker> Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . Hmm . Yeah well <disfmarker> That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , I agree on this . And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , so <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point <disfmarker> No but but <disfmarker> Well the the <disfmarker> Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils <disfmarker> Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it . But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . So uh I c I c If necessary . But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh <disfmarker> Well , we'll we we'll do it like this . Yeah ? Alright , if you think that that's the way it should <gap> <disfmarker> Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . No <disfmarker> No , But do you when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> In the market uh <disfmarker> But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think . No not totally . <vocalsound> Not totally , well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that . Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh <vocalsound> every everyone into account . So <disfmarker> No <gap> <disfmarker> And you might be uh <disfmarker> You might be target customer . Yeah . Well uh who who else thinks like you ? Yes but <disfmarker> Mm . We don't know . Maybe a thousand people , Yeah , we don't know , but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . or a million people . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> let it be like this at uh at this moment . <vocalsound> Let it be . <vocalsound> Alright . Okay ? So that's that . Uh any other suggestions ? <vocalsound> No , I think it's great . Yeah . But what about the redesigning ? <vocalsound> Comes to that later . Okay . <vocalsound> Um you . Uh c You can uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Walter . <vocalsound> You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You're very personal again . <vocalsound> Alright . Great . <vocalsound> That's more useful than just <vocalsound> speaking . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , this is just a short intro . I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . Yes . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I made a <disfmarker> I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . Mm-hmm . And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm . 'Kay . Well <disfmarker> Hmm . I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ? Well d we designed it , so of course we are very <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this . Yeah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . No , I know , Well we designed it to be good-looking . but <vocalsound> I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire . So and we ha we have answer now ? To the customers ? To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? Yeah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> Yeah , but I can't can s Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know . Hmm . But um <disfmarker> Well <vocalsound> we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> Yeah , I think it <disfmarker> Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh , you know <disfmarker> We dis we di <vocalsound> we designed it to be perfect . Yeah . So <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But we have to be critic critical about it . <vocalsound> And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we <vocalsound> we know where we stand . Well , one . <gap> 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . Well so it's point four . Right , so <disfmarker> Easy to find t Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . <vocalsound> Right . Uh is it good-looking ? Well , I guess uh I think uh <vocalsound> it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . <gap> Two . <vocalsound> That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um <vocalsound> uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that <disfmarker> The titanium might be uh f for older people . Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So <disfmarker> It you put uh put a black front on it or something . Hmm . Uh no . <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also <disfmarker> Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking Right . and not only for youth uh young people . I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh <disfmarker> Right . No . I totally agree . Yeah , the fourteen yeah . We we have to get get on , go through this . Right , a number please . Yeah . Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so . So the last one is seven . Easy to change channels ? Um , no it's uh <disfmarker> No , not false . It's one . Oh , sorry . <vocalsound> Yeah , right . Well uh two ? Change channels ? Y Well we have to go through it <gap> . <vocalsound> I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh <disfmarker> Right . So I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . You <disfmarker> How can you make it any easier ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? <vocalsound> With two huge buttons . Yeah , huge is a <disfmarker> Yeah . Yep . Two . Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? Well , no . D we d we don't we don't have uh that s We didn't implement anything about that . <gap> Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , <vocalsound> Well six then . <vocalsound> because of the colour . But <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Six ? Right . Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , Are the functions easy to learn ? but um um <disfmarker> Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an <disfmarker> <gap> We have so few functions , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , I agree . And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? Well , I should <disfmarker> I think two , Yeah . because <vocalsound> the voice recorder is n not self learning . <vocalsound> Ah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <gap> Alright . Two ? Mm ? <vocalsound> Yeah , but just do some <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> We we <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I th I th I think this is too time consuming . Are we take too much time ? Uh not not towards you , Yeah , I agree . No . but towards this all . Th this is <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Right , We you have to put it to the customers . R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? <vocalsound> R_S_I_ sensitive ? Uh well well a bit , so four . Four . Um <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah , very much . <vocalsound> One . One . And features included also one . And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> One . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so . Yeah . Device fancy feeling . And I think fancy-feeling too , Yeah , cool man . because of the titanium back . Yeah . Yeah . Right . Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's great . Is the device easy to use ? The <disfmarker> Yes we have <vocalsound> not many buttons . So well maybe two Well , with the uh <disfmarker> because of the voice recorder . Two <vocalsound> two . Two , three . Three . T Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? F Well in our covers , in our fronts . Yeah . So yes , one . Yeah . One or two . Yeah . One or two , another two . Nah f four I think . Four ? <vocalsound> If you look at this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true . <vocalsound> No . But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . Oh okay . Okay <gap> . Well three . Three , alright . And you can also have <gap> front with uh with fruit on it . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's true . Is the material attractive ? But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah . Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . <vocalsound> So I would say at least two . Right . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Yeah . This is the last meeting ? Yes , but we we have to design much more , The average will uh come later . Yeah . because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . Oh . There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point . My god . I had to fit it in . It has to go to twelve , right ? I twelve and a half . Twelve and a half . So <disfmarker> Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four . The what ? The <disfmarker> The sample speaker , Out . the s sensor . That's easy . Kick it out . Kick it out . The what ? Yeah . We have to go to twelve and a half . The speaker . The speaker costs far , by far the most . Oh . Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option . That's some wrong info , man . <vocalsound> It it isn't worth it . No . No , d th No . No . We could make two different versions , one with and one without . It's uh <disfmarker> But for this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's just extra . Kick it out . So , zero . <vocalsound> Yeah . Then we go to fourteen point six . What more ? Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . <vocalsound> Batteries are uh quite <disfmarker> No . L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on , <vocalsound> Uh no , no no no . Um <disfmarker> w a remote control has a battery . N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . Because uh <disfmarker> Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said . <gap> the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah ? Hmm . Can't we do that with a regular chip ? No . Why not ? Because uh that uh y <vocalsound> Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ? because my information says it . Huh ? What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? Yeah . Regular is normal . Yeah . And simple ? Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but <disfmarker> Simple . <vocalsound> Nothing . <vocalsound> Elementary . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , Well <gap> ? I I read something about it , Your part . but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report . What happens if we do <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Single <disfmarker> Well you have to use a chip . So <disfmarker> Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . How much do we win ? We we we <disfmarker> One . Why ? <gap> We have very little options furthermore , for the <disfmarker> But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Uh well we have to put that in . Yeah , we need to have the <vocalsound> the L_C_D_ screen . That that's a fact . Uh <disfmarker> Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , No <disfmarker> <vocalsound> because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour . Yeah , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's only one half . Nah . No , that's n It's not relevant . Uh it d it doesn't <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah , you must change the chip uh back . then you s then you only have one half left . You must change the chip back , Nils . Yeah . Uh yeah . But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . No , <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Then the whole concept is uh Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> No <vocalsound> we oh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> You can make you can make it cheaper . You have to use it . But if you don't sell <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , Yeah . <vocalsound> and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double . Yeah ? Y we don't need both . No , <vocalsound> the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah . Says <gap> . Says , his <disfmarker> Uh that was in the second meeting , I think . Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well I I did single curve to <disfmarker> Well you said s double curved , I ? <gap> ? uh he , Yeah . because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . <gap> No We can also make it flat . Well <disfmarker> no no no . But what what did what do n But <disfmarker> Sorry , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> What do they mean with the curves ? Is th Is this a curve ? Curved ? Yes , that's curved . One curve ? Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . Yes . It's how you <disfmarker> It's how you look at it . No , it's one curve . <vocalsound> One curve . <vocalsound> One curve , simple . <gap> Well then we have a huge problem I think . W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . We have a big financial problem . Well we make it more expensive to buy . Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But <disfmarker> Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . But uh I <disfmarker> Yeah or we could replace it <disfmarker> If you if you make it cool to have <disfmarker> By the way , we also have this one . Oh , that's just great . Oh , costs nothing . Oh , alright . <vocalsound> That's nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . Plastic is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> Yes , but I just got it . <vocalsound> Well that's pretty uh l Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , That is pretty stupid . <vocalsound> N not very practical . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> uh titanium-coloured plastic ? Who ? <vocalsound> You want to dump the titanium ? Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there . <vocalsound> But I'm n I don't agree . But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . I think <disfmarker> Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . Ah no no . <vocalsound> It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same . No , I don't think so . Y Well , I do think so . I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the <disfmarker> Yes . And the feel , <gap> feel . and th that it is strong , and <disfmarker> And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i Yeah , I agree . Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . We still <vocalsound> we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , Yeah . but not lose the one <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think the titanium is very important . Yeah alright but then we we won't get there . Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think . I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . Well what else ? W I mean uh <disfmarker> No , nothing . Or you shou <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> Amen . Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah . Because you have lots of functions <vocalsound> in it too . <vocalsound> Yeah , well yeah . Alright . Yeah . Why can't I <disfmarker> I agree with that . But <disfmarker> So we u we use uh <disfmarker> Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . Yeah , I agree . So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . I I'll talk to the managers . <vocalsound> No no no no . W Titanium stays there . Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah this is good , Osl <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but it it's not good enough . <vocalsound> So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . Ah those <gap> those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Come on . Riot . <vocalsound> What do we <disfmarker> Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So <disfmarker> Yes , yes . No because we did not know anything about it . If you don't have the money , you can't make it . Yeah al alright , yeah . One and a half Euros . Hmm ? But we have to deal with it now . So <disfmarker> So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive . So ? So <disfmarker> So we have to make it cheaper . Titanium gone and add plastic . Right . Yeah , but then we've got money left . And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ? Well , no it's just uh all plastic . No <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well alright . Huh . <vocalsound> No yeah well <disfmarker> <gap> <vocalsound> Oh six . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's just free , man . A lot of plastic , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Four . So <disfmarker> No two for the to make it clear . But then we can add the special colour ? Yeah . As we have money over uh left . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . W And we still have money left . What do we want , guys ? I want gold plating . <vocalsound> Yeah right . No no um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I want chrome . <vocalsound> Well I think uh the case is double curved then . Yes . <vocalsound> We have we have to uh fill <disfmarker> Because you y have that curve and you have that curve . <vocalsound> Well , th that that is the problem . Y Oh no . <vocalsound> W we ha <vocalsound> Yeah well uh <disfmarker> Alright . No no no , but th that's not f um <disfmarker> Safe . Well y we have curves in all directions . Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped , so it it can be done . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> alright . <vocalsound> But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven . Finance ? I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it . We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . Well , guys ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Guys ? <vocalsound> We have to dump our titanium , Shoot . and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , Objection . <vocalsound> Pro project . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> project . <vocalsound> Well , <vocalsound> satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think it's uh <disfmarker> Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , me too . That's really bad . Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but <disfmarker> But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason , And uh unrealistic . but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity . Well we we we used our creativity , Right . but we just had to adapt it to the costs . <vocalsound> Which isn't very practical , <vocalsound> but <vocalsound> that's the way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nei . Uh no . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , alright . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Uh leadership <vocalsound> Terrible . <vocalsound> next . Uh teamwork ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Leadership . Leadership ? Well <disfmarker> Well it's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It was very democratic . <vocalsound> Uh yeah well <vocalsound> I think so also . Yeah . Yeah . I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements . <vocalsound> But o alright , the teamwork ? Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements . <vocalsound> It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess . No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications . <vocalsound> Alright , teamwork ? Well <disfmarker> Well great I think . Right yeah . <gap> Yeah , think so too . Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? <vocalsound> It was a complete disaster . <vocalsound> Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ? <vocalsound> No <disfmarker> Uh it it it uh it is uh <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen . It's also a It's both the SMARTboards . Or not ? <vocalsound> No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard . That's the digital panel . I liked this SMARTboard , This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ? but I hated that one . Well it's both a SMARTboard . That's that's the smart Yeah right . B but you <disfmarker> This is just a large t large television . Oh they're both SMARTboards . <vocalsound> No . You u you use the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A televi Yeah . <vocalsound> It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw . Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But <disfmarker> Well , wi w which one did you like ? <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah . Left or right ? <vocalsound> That one . <vocalsound> That one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That one isn't accurate . Yeah . <vocalsound> It just doesn't work . Yeah . <vocalsound> You can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But I I think this is meant by the digital pen . Yes . Th that is so . Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the <vocalsound> these th Well I didn't use uh <disfmarker> Yeah . We're now talking about the SMARTboards . I don't need a SMARTboard . Nei It it's much m <vocalsound> <gap> Well we we used that one , Yeah , and we needed it . I think . but <vocalsound> give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper . Yeah alright , but <disfmarker> Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an <disfmarker> I I like it . Right . Yeah I like that one , Okay , alright . but that one is terrible . But uh you can uh <disfmarker> I I sent it about three times now . Uh <vocalsound> a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . Yeah . Yeah , it is . Yeah . The simple uh sch school board . So <disfmarker> I agree . And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ? No . I I didn't use it . I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop . I used it uh just to check it out , but uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> That's the <gap> <disfmarker> You you can't send that to anyone , <gap> Yeah . <vocalsound> because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , It isn't practical . Right . and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no . W <vocalsound> But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block . Your notepad . Yeah . So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into <disfmarker> It's , no , it it's useless . Well I I drew this . <gap> Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah alright . For drawings , For drawings , yes . but not for personal notes . Yeah for drawings . I think that's not very <disfmarker> <gap> N notes mm . Uh I mean <vocalsound> you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that . If you've <disfmarker> If you've <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict <disfmarker> Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , right . So it doesn't d doesn't have any <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That Stefan use . Yeah I understand . But I think uh d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . <vocalsound> You can't <disfmarker> It's not very uh ni No , I don't think so . Yeah well a lot of documents are <disfmarker> Yeah . It's it's only useful if you have to draw something . Yeah . But then uh it's really useful , I think . Yeah . Yep . Alright . Mu Yeah right . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ? Yeah , great . Yeah . <vocalsound> Of course great . Yeah . Hmm . Can we keep them ? Uh . Yeah . You can . <vocalsound> B by my <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Wireless uh wireless things . Thanks Project Manager . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Other uh things we used here ? I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . <vocalsound> Well these chairs , man . <vocalsound> Really great . But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well did you really uh <disfmarker> Did you really take uh take those in account ? <vocalsound> I <vocalsound> half of time I didn't notice they were there . So <disfmarker> No . No . I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . <vocalsound> I don't care about it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But we shouldn't talk about that . Well I did . <vocalsound> Because <vocalsound> this is a realistic environment . Well w why not ? Uh etcetera <gap> <disfmarker> We <disfmarker> <gap> Right . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> N new ideas found ? <vocalsound> What kind of ideas for n a future schedule <vocalsound> <disfmarker> What ? <vocalsound> For future um meetings <vocalsound> you have got ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I missed uh the option to uh to email , Communicate in between . yeah . Email or chat or something . Yeah , right . Yeah . <vocalsound> But yeah . W well th that's just the the environment they set us up f with . So <disfmarker> Chatting and emailing . Yeah alright , but that's one n new idea . <vocalsound> Yeah , I agree . Well , new ideas found by this . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not . Nothing . Well , more more information in the beginning . We don't want this . We hate this . Yeah . <vocalsound> That's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Digital pen is useless . So <disfmarker> No it isn't . Yeah , for drawings . Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . So it isn't useless . But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I'm not going to uh <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful . No <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop . But it's still an expensive uh expensive <disfmarker> Because this is huge Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh this v very very uh expensive paper . Well you you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand . Yeah , I agree . With the mouse it is <disfmarker> No . <gap> But if w Yeah . Yeah . Well and if <disfmarker> Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching . Uh indeed . And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? <vocalsound> A Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you can't draw anything uh neat . Really ? Yeah , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , <vocalsound> yeah , very precise <disfmarker> Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li I if it if it would be perfect following . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well th th then still it's it's it's very expensive uh towards a a just a green <gap> uh <gap> school board . Well it isn't , <vocalsound> Yeah , mu but maybe that thing is uh is <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , board , a school board , yeah . Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yep . I it has <disfmarker> It is useful . Yeah . It saves time . Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . So uh if we get in uh if we get another one <vocalsound> and you make sure it does work , Yep . I think then it's pretty useful . Yeah . Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then you can save it immediately . Well , they are now . Hmm . Celebration . It is . So , congratulations crew . Did you type that ? Hmm . Celebration . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Se <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Yeah , we can go to the bar and uh with our <vocalsound> newly earned money . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Finally my beer . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , that's it I think . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um I don't know how long we still have . <vocalsound> I dunno how long uh we had for this last meeting . But uh <disfmarker> Maybe till four o'clock or something ? <vocalsound> Well dunno . Yeah . Well yeah , it is a bit uh <disfmarker> Well we still have to make the end report and uh all those things . <gap> I have to do that . Yeah . <gap> You better get started . <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> Di did you um save this one in the folder ? Oh . No . No no no no . Can you do that ? No we must save this thing , yeah . In the shared map map . But Nils you've got some work left . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't know what you have to do . Map , is it a good word ? The folder , yeah . Huh . <vocalsound> I have to go to a physiotherapy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Oh it worked . Two times quick . <vocalsound> Wow . <vocalsound> Oh , alright . <vocalsound> Cool . <vocalsound> So it is useful , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> It is handy . Oh great , man . No but uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This is nice . I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Radical . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> D design . Do you believe it yourself ? S Oh . He saved them all ten . Well alright . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well they they wanted everything we produced , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> My big bird . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Your big beautiful bird . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Where is this <gap> ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe the pen is just uh uh broken and the board isn't . <vocalsound> Of or the other way around uh <disfmarker> Maybe you are broken . <vocalsound> Yeah I think so too . You know . I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . <vocalsound> I think she's listening . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I also think so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Who is she you're talking about ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> She already knows . Oh you mean our uh coach , our f personal coach . She ? Big brother . Our manager . Is she also our accountant ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh . I don't think so . Close your laptop . Because then we have to confront her with our <disfmarker> So she can see we're ready . I feel watched . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Let's take this remote into uh production . We put the fashion in electronics , <vocalsound> but we couldn't because of the costs . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> That that's the title of our uh end document . That that's our new slogan . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics . <vocalsound> Blame our accountants . Do that . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's a nice title . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> But we couldn't , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very catching . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Well I th Yeah . I'm sure management would like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> She's on the move . I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , that's just great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um <vocalsound> remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no <disfmarker> we're not doing D_V_D_ , Okay . we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be a television remote . <vocalsound> Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . <vocalsound> For reasons that I don't really know . There's <disfmarker> but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh <vocalsound> um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . <vocalsound> Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on <disfmarker> Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ? Gotta plug you in . Oh , right yeah . Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . Yep . Cool . Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation . Brilliant . Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely . So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was <disfmarker> since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . Mm . The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Fair enough . Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . 'Kay . Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits Fine . which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , <vocalsound> Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics 'cause we were thinking <disfmarker> that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white <disfmarker> like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , Right . It needs , yeah . you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do . Okay , okay . <vocalsound> That's the end of my presentation . Cool . Great . Thank you very much Nathan . <vocalsound> Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well . <vocalsound> S plug yourself in here . Mm . <vocalsound> Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Looks like you're in okay . Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting . Th There you go . There you go . Sweet . Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before . Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um <vocalsound> now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well Oh yeah look at that . Mm . <vocalsound> but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions Mm-hmm . because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . So my personal preferences . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nice . <vocalsound> Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there . <vocalsound> Okay . Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh <gap> . Great . Thanks for that Ron . Right . <vocalsound> 'Kay Does that mean I'm up ? yep that's you . I think so . Okay . I can plug you in . Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . Slide show up and running . Or not . Uh . Give it a little bit . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort <disfmarker> like watching a hundred people <vocalsound> use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . <vocalsound> And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their <disfmarker> the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . <vocalsound> Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , <vocalsound> and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . <vocalsound> So it's a good start for us . <vocalsound> That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um Need to unplug this ? yep I'll just uh switch that back here . Need it back . I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . There you go . <vocalsound> Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um <vocalsound> through you guys's presentations um <vocalsound> we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . <vocalsound> Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , Oh right . <vocalsound> um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics <vocalsound> um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so . <vocalsound> Yes . So maybe this <disfmarker> we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So Right . <vocalsound> uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um , Right . which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly . Uh . Um so um . How <disfmarker> th this voice operation thing is <disfmarker> I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . Right . Mm . Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ <vocalsound> but we might be able to say um <vocalsound> volume up . Yeah . Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . Mm . <vocalsound> Oh . That could work . I like that . With a simple command like locate . Yeah . And then it could start to beep Something very basic . Right . and <vocalsound> Right . therefore be found . Sounds good . Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ? Oh yeah I think that's very doable . Okay . The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away <disfmarker> Yeah . It's a good point . If it's hidden under the couch <disfmarker> but then again you have this wee <disfmarker> this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . Mm . And you just say something to <disfmarker> into that Yeah . and it Yeah . Yeah . finds your <disfmarker> K <vocalsound> Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing Yeah . but <disfmarker> yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . <vocalsound> The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . True . And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k Making it just an option ? Mm . exactly Yeah . and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . Right . <vocalsound> Yeah . I was thinking uh <disfmarker> Are we still thinking about this screen <disfmarker> sorry . Oh go ahead . Go ahead . The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? Mm-hmm . 'S definitely an option technically . Okay . I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , Okay . they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . We're doing okay . 'Cause it seems like an interesting option Okay . especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have Mm . <vocalsound> menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things Yeah . that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for . Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . Mm-hmm . True . Worth looking into . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . Yeah . The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . True . Okay . Yeah . So it's just something to consider . Okay . Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . Mm-hmm . Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many , Mm . we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um . Yeah . <vocalsound> I appear to have lost my microphone . Mm . <vocalsound> Right um we don't have many people <vocalsound> or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . Um right . I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um . The thing with <disfmarker> I see <vocalsound> would there not be a <vocalsound> we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? <vocalsound> Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct , I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . Okay . Mm . Just the casing . Okay . We could have the casing , the the face plates . Okay . Back to the uh the cost <disfmarker> the material . <vocalsound> We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That's something I w for <disfmarker> say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . Mm . Mm . And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? Yeah . We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether <disfmarker> Right . See if there <disfmarker> if there's even interest out there . Okay . Okay . Right . Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to <disfmarker> who all Mm . Right . it's not like with cell phones like where you have a <disfmarker> you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , Mm-hmm . so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ <disfmarker> Mm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house True . True . True . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and most people have their televisions in the living room . Uh . <vocalsound> Alright well we can <disfmarker> we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . Yeah . Oh yeah . Sure . <vocalsound> True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um <vocalsound> yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um <disfmarker> Yeah yeah okay . Um <disfmarker> Interface ? Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally <disfmarker> let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have <disfmarker> Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . <vocalsound> Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . True . 'Cause it would have a docking base ? Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well . Yeah . Hmm . <vocalsound> So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years <vocalsound> even with the touch screen ? <vocalsound> Do they ? Those new ones . Okay . Can we afford that ? Can we afford to include one of those ? <vocalsound> And will somebody buy it if we don't ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . Right . Okay so let's go with a um touch screen <vocalsound> with um some kind of <disfmarker> you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology <disfmarker> For twelve Euros ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple It is . Fair enough . <vocalsound> you know so <disfmarker> you know . Well yeah I mean The basics . you can put the <disfmarker> we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics . Mm . Okay so we'll <gap> touch screen and the battery , 'Kay . focus on um <vocalsound> uh presentation . Um <vocalsound> it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um Right . and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while <disfmarker> to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep . Okay . Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into <disfmarker> go into the next round of individual work on this . Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . Be interesting . Mm . What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um <vocalsound> And <gap> oh . logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said . Yeah the <vocalsound> the fashion We put fashion into electronics . do . Yeah . W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and <disfmarker> Yeah I think perhaps <disfmarker> 'S too much . good idea Yeah . but yeah I think that that one m might just be um and they just <disfmarker> yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular <disfmarker> For now . a P_D_A_ would <disfmarker> they would <disfmarker> makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but <disfmarker> I dunno , what do you guys think ? Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . Yeah . Nice . That'd be okay . Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . Um . Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading Hmm . and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary <disfmarker> Mm . Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . <vocalsound> Mm . True . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Y <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah you would think . Jus But . But apparently not . If it comes from above . People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . So . <vocalsound> They just want it to be on and ready to go . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it <disfmarker> the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Well Kind of if i all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . Mm . Oh to wake up okay Yep . or go into like a dormant mode . Goes into a sleep mode . Okay . <vocalsound> Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . We're good ? Sounds good . I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference . I've put my files in the shared folder as well . Brilliant . Yeah . <vocalsound> That's fab guys . Cool .
Okay . Right . Conceptual design meeting . Right . Okay , so <disfmarker> Right well um from the last meeting <vocalsound> I was trying to send you the minutes , but uh it didn't work out too well , so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had . <vocalsound> Uh right , so <disfmarker> Wishing I hadn't closed the damn <disfmarker> Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . We had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements . And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . So . So basically what decisions uh have we uh made ? Uh have there been any uh changes ? I think we all have a presentation again , so if we go through those and then um Right . Yeah . Three presentation , yeah . <gap> . Shall I go first again ? <gap> So <disfmarker> Yeah , fine . Okay . I see <gap> this a little more smoothly than the last one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay right , let's get started . Um basically the uh for the <disfmarker> Um I'll <gap> back actually . For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . Then there is a chip and still the sender . So um yes <gap> including the power s supply as well . Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , um . <vocalsound> There's a dynamo . Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up <gap> um . There's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . Um that's one option , Mm-hmm . but I think that was gonna cost a little more . And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is <disfmarker> Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , Okay . which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal <disfmarker> for like uh like modern computer . Um there's a scroll wheel which is <disfmarker> you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . You could do do that . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . Um moving on to the printed s What would be the cost do do we know ? Um that's on the next <disfmarker> <gap> I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . Um which is the next section . Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just <disfmarker> see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . Mm-hmm . The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each . So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . Mm-hmm . Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . And that's it . 'Kay . <gap> with the printed circuit boards you were going for the <disfmarker> Thanks . <vocalsound> Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . Mm-hmm . Uh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into . But are we going f R right . Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um . So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , Yeah yeah . We decide . Yeah . Mm-hmm . so would it not be best to <disfmarker> rather than <disfmarker> I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . The other way would be to do the presentation Mm-hmm . and then make the decision at that point in time . Um . Maybe w Yeah , that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . 'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular <gap> and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time Um . and then that would be the end of that issue . Does that make sense ? Yes . <vocalsound> Um I have a lot of the information there . Mm-hmm . It might not be very clear . Is there <disfmarker> Unless you want to plug it back in to yours . Um . We could do , yeah . Um yeah we should <gap> . <vocalsound> As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it didn't <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um . No the scroll wheel required the regular , so the <disfmarker> Yeah if if you <gap> down um . It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted , Hmm . but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , <vocalsound> which is in the higher price range . Okay . I think the scroll wheel um <disfmarker> The display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . Also the display's for something else which we decided against . Um but that bit <disfmarker> Okay . And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down . Down . Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? Mm-hmm . I I've got um pictures well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it , and they don't really look great . Right . Okay . 'Kay . So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the <disfmarker> So . So we're going for p Okay . So <gap> is um <disfmarker> So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? Yeah , a simple pushbuttons . Okay . Simple push button . <vocalsound> <gap> Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? The um it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message um and replies to you . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So it is basically the concept we discussed before . <gap> Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . I'm guessing it would , but <gap> got like the definite information . Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than <disfmarker> So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? Or are we going for the regular ? Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . Mm-mm . But is there any other <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean okay , that's true for the <disfmarker> for for that element , but we have to take all <gap> el elements into consideration . And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S Mm . Hmm . I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we <gap> m make a decision . But <disfmarker> But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , Right . it just <disfmarker> it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . Oh yeah , I suppose so , yeah . Mm-hmm . So maybe that would be something separate , yeah . So I don't think it would effect our circuit board . Yeah . No . Okay , so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . Oh that makes sense . 'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo . Mm-mm . It might be useful to say like where are you remote . Here I am , Jo . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ? Okay . Yeah . Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . Yeah , just as a fun way to find it . <vocalsound> Okay . Um . Simple circuit board . Simple push button . Okay . W w kinetic . And it says that <disfmarker> I think it said the cost of that isn't too much . You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . Um yeah I I thought so just for <disfmarker> just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um . And how does it get uh charged up ? It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . Mm-hmm . Okay . So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it . Okay . Yeah . So the speech recognition was <disfmarker> Are we going for speech recognition ? No ? 'Cause that required the advanced <disfmarker> Um I think it would be helpful to find it , but I don't think it'd um <disfmarker> Just <disfmarker> Uh yeah I think <disfmarker> did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected <disfmarker> Yeah , I think so . Just just for the call and find thing . It was just <disfmarker> I had speech recognition requires advanced req require Oh no th that's what that's what I thought , but maybe maybe it doesn't <gap> . Um I think I might have got that wrong . Oh . 'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it , So okay . it's not part of the <disfmarker> Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . It's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah . And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . Would that be <disfmarker> 'Kay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . 'Kay shall I pass on to you now ? I think <disfmarker> In fact , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ? I'll just just check what it said . Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so like it's already kind of <disfmarker> Yeah . I assume it would cost extra , but <disfmarker> Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . <vocalsound> And then have to change all <vocalsound> change <gap> everything at the last minute . <vocalsound> Okay . S Um . <vocalsound> Oh , that was quick . Um okay , so very brief presentation , um . From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . All of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons . Does that move it ? Sorry ? It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . <vocalsound> Yeah , I've found that <gap> try and get it back . If you right click and then go onto a previous slide . Ah it's alright . Um . There wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . <vocalsound> Okay , right . Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . Um so that's a bit of competition there . So I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control Yeah , yeah . rather than trying to compete with the functions . Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . And there's no real advantage and <disfmarker> because it impacts on other <disfmarker> on the materials and the price it's not great . On the price , yeah . So you were saying the scroll buttons <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . 'Kay . Mm-hmm . Um but I don't know if that's really in our field ? But that's something that's out there . I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , <gap> maybe not , but <disfmarker> Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude <disfmarker> Hmm . The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a <disfmarker> You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . But that's really where your field is . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should <disfmarker> Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . Hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . Right well that's something that we can be aware of . Is that So so what are we deciding to do here ? Um . I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . Right . Mm-hmm . Uh the fi Yeah , the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . Yeah . Yeah . So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . Okay . Oh yeah . S s so um <disfmarker> Different languages might not be compatible . Yeah , yeah . It w it would make it quite complicated , Hmm . where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the <disfmarker> Hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah , 'cause I think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question . Yeah , yeah . Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it . Yeah . Yeah . So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . Hmm . Maybe And you were talking unless something else comes up . Mm . And you were talking about scroll buttons ? Um yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit Okay . Yeah . <gap> b and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it . Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , was that right ? Yes yes . Hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote . Okay . So not to be focused on . Yeah . Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . Um just to avoid ambiguity . So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume , <disfmarker> Um let's think how they did this . Good in in <disfmarker> I'm just gonna check so I do this right . Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down . An upside-down V_ . Um . What did they say ? So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down . Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see <disfmarker> Actually that can't be right , can it ? Right . Oh well , no , they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , Mm-hmm . whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . Mm-hmm . So , be careful what you put on the buttons So maybe we could have like <disfmarker> and be careful of the shape that you make them , Mm-hmm . Yeah . because they might be kind of two um contradicting kind of shapes . Yeah I I know what you mean . So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . Yeah . Yeah . You could have volume up and volume <vocalsound> Possible . <disfmarker> Volume up , down and <disfmarker> Like that . Mm . And 'cause the idea was to have limited um <disfmarker> it was to have sizable amount of information on it . Yeah yeah <gap> . Limited number of buttons . Yeah . 'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were <disfmarker> Yeah we got it down to not too many . Mm-hmm . Um and I think that's all I had to say for that . Okay . Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ? Um <disfmarker> Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . Yeah , maybe we should see yours first . Oh okay . Okay . Cool . Right , um I've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one <disfmarker> that's the one I talked about last time , that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You know <gap> yourself . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . 'Kay . And second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . And apparently , the fashion trends <vocalsound> are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , <vocalsound> which is contrary to last year , apparently . I presume it must have been not not spongy last year . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . <vocalsound> And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that . <vocalsound> Right , so that'll be it . <vocalsound> Maybe a banana or courgette or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ? I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people . And I would've thought the functionality <disfmarker> 'cause the people get cheesed off by things <disfmarker> by having to read instructions et cetera , so . Yeah . Yeah . .. . Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple . <vocalsound> Maybe yeah . <vocalsound> And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , Okay . Now ? Yeah . <vocalsound> and it wouldn't confuse the numbers . Stand-by button . <vocalsound> No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . Mm-hmm . Well I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , But what are they gonna be next <disfmarker> Yeah . What are they gonna be next year . <vocalsound> maybe <disfmarker> Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Hmm . S But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh <vocalsound> I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I'm not <disfmarker> That means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , Yeah . so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest . I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . I don't know . I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> to something which is maybe more universal . Mm-hmm . Well <disfmarker> But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , Mm-hmm . um even if the design kind of changes , <disfmarker> We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly . Mm-hmm . Ah d d But if <disfmarker> Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um . Mm-hmm . Well . Yep . Maybe still with a rubber design we could <disfmarker> Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this <disfmarker> Or was <disfmarker> the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? It was , wasn't it ? Yeah . It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . So the <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Um . And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look . Oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case . Mm-hmm . Oh right , Um oh no no no that fits , doesn't it ? sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . That's the way round . If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . Which makes sense . Right . Um . Rubber buttons require rubber case . <gap> And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber . Mm-hmm . Uh so , yeah . The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay <disfmarker> you want to basically mint them out Mm-hmm . 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock Mm-hmm . and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . Yeah . Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that , and especially 'cause then you could make it something that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Well , you might be limited in space , that <vocalsound> yes . <gap> would or not . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine . Hmm . Yes yes . <vocalsound> Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions <vocalsound> like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , Mm-hmm . whether that would just increase the costs , Hmm . make it more complicated . That's possibly it . So you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing . Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , Mm-hmm . but you could change the the way it looked . Yeah and then you could have <disfmarker> Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , Yeah , that's true . but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that . Yeah you you could do a colour change , so therefore you would yeah yeah <disfmarker> I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in <disfmarker> rather than all in black Yeah . Mm-hmm . or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? <vocalsound> Hmm . But uh so <disfmarker> So it is a possibility , um . But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ? We haven't really seen that yet Yes oh that's true Oh okay yes Yeah . uh that might no that is <disfmarker> It might <disfmarker> and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things . Well not necessarily , because you could have your company uh <disfmarker> We're we're meant to be finishing up . You could have your company badge and logo . I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge Mm-hmm . so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing . Mm-hmm . 'Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it . Mm-hmm . And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So . Hmm . And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . <gap> Mm-hmm . Well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well , Yeah . Yeah . and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ? Yeah , I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing but I'm <disfmarker> Yeah . I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , people see you with it all about and <vocalsound> Yeah I suppose , i if it where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time . It's uh in in the house , isn't it , Yeah . I suppose . I think <disfmarker> Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case <disfmarker> So don't change case . Mm-hmm . Change case colour . And we're sort of saying no to that . Did we decide on the rubber case ? The spongy feel , or did we think that that might go as a trend ? Well , it was different last year . The trend was different last year apparently . It was not not spongy feel . But <disfmarker> I don't know whether the trend will change . I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . Yeah . Yeah , less likely to <disfmarker> Sounds reasonable . <vocalsound> <gap> So then th th that would <disfmarker> If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could <disfmarker> or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . <gap> it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . Okay . Okay . Um . Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . <vocalsound> There's flat , there's single-curved and there's double-curved . Um . I'm not exactly sure what these things look like . Mayb Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well it says that <disfmarker> When you say d when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ? I'm not exactly sure . Okay . <vocalsound> Um I'll show you the remotes that I've got . See how uh <disfmarker> Let's just get that bigger . See how uh the one <disfmarker> Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ? No you're not connected to me anymore . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> That doesn't help . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> One one thing to cons Shall I just turn it round for time ? one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um <disfmarker> by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other <gap> That should come up . therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can <disfmarker> if you can store them up on top of each other . Mm <gap> . Mm-hmm . Whereas if you do um fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that . And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product . Yeah yeah . Mm-hmm . Hmm . So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of <disfmarker> So but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . Um it's not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there . No . Mm yep . Right . I'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ? <vocalsound> That's what I was trying to work out . <vocalsound> But um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there . Oh right . Shall we S so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ? <gap> We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so . Definitely a single , maybe a double . Yeah . 'Kay , so shall we quickly <disfmarker> Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? We'll go for single curve , yeah . Okay . <gap> Okay , Single curve . curved or double curved ? So it's single curved . So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? The one you move around ? Yeah I think that think that's a good idea . Yeah . Yep . Okay . Um <disfmarker> <gap> And the rubber push buttons , rubber case . Rubber <disfmarker> Rubber buttons and case . Um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we , but possibly a sticker . Oh we ca Yeah yeah , we'll still have the <disfmarker> Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated <gap> . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board . Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Um . Yes . Yep . And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to <disfmarker> that we seemed to leave out . Okay . And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . <vocalsound> Or veg . Yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years . Uh what sort of shape do we want ? Don't know , maybe just So we've got spongy feel buttons as well , have we ? As well as <disfmarker> or w or was that <disfmarker> Yeah . That's ru rubber buttons , yeah . Yeah , it was just <disfmarker> So it's rubber buttons , so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . 'Kay . Yeah . <vocalsound> With a rubber case right ? Yeah , Reasonably spongy I guess , yeah . so it's not too wacky . And the standby button is gonna be different . Yeah okay . Um I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape . If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird . <vocalsound> Yeah <gap> . Okay so what what shape are we making the standby button ? Apple ? Vote ? A apple . <gap> Oh oh <disfmarker> Sorry ? Yeah . Shall we vote on it ? Yeah . We will go for the a a a apples apples . Anyone got any suggestions ? Apple apple a a qu Quite a big one , as well . <vocalsound> Okay . Ah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A big apple . Uh <disfmarker> Well it could be red . <gap> Could be a red apple , yeah . Either , don't mind . A red apple ? Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , Is it ? once we find out um <disfmarker> Okay . And then we're gonna <disfmarker> are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? Just like the <disfmarker> Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time . Mm-hmm . Um . Yeah . Yeah that seems pretty straight forward . Yeah . 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain . 'Kay . Mm-hmm . Okay . Sorry what was that last thing again there ? Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple . Right <gap> much option on that . I thought you were going for a single curve and <disfmarker> Ah just the uh shape of the buttons . Alright . And j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . Yeah . Fairly sort of self explanatory . Right , so shape of buttons simple . Okay . So that's that , I guess . We should now go away and get these things sorted out . <gap> I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay , so um . Is that the end ? Okay . Looks like it . <vocalsound> Okay .
'Kay . Hmm . Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of <vocalsound> our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think <disfmarker> looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um <vocalsound> so actually I think <disfmarker> Yeah um f <vocalsound> you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay well um . So our design looks something like this . This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your <disfmarker> to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes <disfmarker> You could change the vegetable , or fruit . yeah , I can change the vegetable . Oh is that broccoli ? <vocalsound> This one's broccoli <vocalsound> . Yeah . So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . This is a mango . The <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . <vocalsound> You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'S a very bright strawberry . <vocalsound> So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . It's been a l And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . <vocalsound> It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . Mm-hmm . Oh yeah . And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was <disfmarker> or design yet actually , would be the um thing <disfmarker> the locator . How how <disfmarker> so <disfmarker> Well the locator is just chip that's inside there . Okay so that's just <disfmarker> And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere So you have to have a button on your on your <disfmarker> you have to attach the button to the <disfmarker> Yeah we didn't design that . Yeah we have <disfmarker> that that has yes yet to be designed . But it would be coordinating with that of course . Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset . Yeah . Mm-hmm . You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So . Tada . Oh . Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed <disfmarker> I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be <disfmarker> My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . But it's really not very clear , Oh . Okay . because you got single curve and double curve and <disfmarker> d I dunno what that means . Right . One side is curved and then the other side is curved . Well <disfmarker> yeah . If we're talking about the area just <disfmarker> oh I d I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? Mm-hmm . Um and lots of special colours actually . <vocalsound> Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ? No I think that's alright . Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . <vocalsound> And if we sold a lot of squishy things . Mm . Boo yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> S So <disfmarker> Mm . Did y what did you work on ? The <disfmarker> Um evaluation criteria . Okay . Do you wanna <disfmarker> I've got a presentation . Okay . I think that's <disfmarker> So I need <disfmarker> where's the cable ? Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . Um . Right . This doesn't <disfmarker> okay . Um the method is <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is <disfmarker> everything's listed down . Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And <vocalsound> we we have therefore in total um <disfmarker> We have five <disfmarker> we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um . No . This is the table . Can you see this here ? Mm-hmm . Um so the que the questions I've given you <disfmarker> c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um . I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told . <vocalsound> Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah it's in the um <disfmarker> it's in the project documents . Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes . It's called evaluation criteria . Okay . And it's under evaluation . Huh , the PowerPoint one ? Hmm ? Yeah . Okay . Cool . You've found it all ? Yeah . So it was um <disfmarker> Yeah true's one . True's one and false is seven . Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? Um we can do it separately and then discuss it <vocalsound> Yeah okay . if if that's what people wanna do . So it's actually a scale . Wait , one is true and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , so these are the questions we're answering . yes And one is <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> if it's fancy you put one , One , right okay . if it's really unfancy it's seven . If it's somewhere in between you put four . <vocalsound> Yeah , something . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Does it feel fancy ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Feels like play-dough . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> They shouldn't really be questions . Should be more like <disfmarker> Are the batteries easy to insert ? <vocalsound> I'm gonna say yes . <vocalsound> Yes ? Very very true . Okay . <vocalsound> I imagine they're somewhere on the front . We have a little case that you slip 'em in . Okay . Are we just about ready ? Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we <disfmarker> um is it necessary ? I don't think so . It's <disfmarker> We'll just do um <disfmarker> yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Okay . Our animals will forever be there . <vocalsound> Un unless you feel you need it t to <disfmarker> I don't feel any <disfmarker> <vocalsound> okay okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We'll <disfmarker> right um <disfmarker> Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle . One . 'Kay Five . Right . Ooh I don't know . <vocalsound> Right . One ? Five . Five . Five . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ? <vocalsound> I I think we should <disfmarker> It's four if you wanna do that . Yeah . Yeah ? It adds to sixteen , so that's four . Yeah . Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two . Oh I thought she said five . Hmm . One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . I think that's um <disfmarker> next ? Um three . Six . Six . <vocalsound> Really ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Two . <vocalsound> I wasn't cheating I swear . Uh-oh . Right . One point three is <disfmarker> So it's a one was true and seven was false ? <gap> Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ? Huh ? Uh . Yeah . I really <disfmarker> Oh I thought it was the other way round . Wait a minute . I thought it was the other way round too . Well uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sh Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top <vocalsound> . Yeah yeah . It was one is true and <vocalsound> false is seven . <vocalsound> I should've kept the table up . Oh gosh . Okay . Well <disfmarker> I'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem . Yeah . Right , well I'm glad this came out . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I thought you guys hated it . <vocalsound> I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> No . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh that's quite funny <vocalsound> . Okay . Okay . <gap> Yeah . Okay . So , starting again , one point one ? One . Say two . Three . Two . Okay , one point two ? Uh three . Two . Two . Two . Okay . Um , one point three ? One . One . One . Ha . <vocalsound> Two point one ? Uh two . Two . Uh two . Two point <disfmarker> I think I missed two . <vocalsound> Wait , is that two point one ? Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason . Yeah . One point four , one point five . Okay right Oh dear , okay . Sorry . that's <disfmarker> I have two of them . Mine has all kinds of problems . Two and one . Sorry about that . <vocalsound> T two point two , which is one point five . One . Uh three . Wait why did I put three ? Uh one . I meant one on mine too . Okay . Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ? Uh one . Three point one . I have four . Three . One , four , three , three , three point two ? Three . Three . Uh . One . Three point three . One . One . Two . Four point one ? One . Two . Five . Two . Four point two . Two . Three . Four . Two and four point three . Two . One , two . One . Two . Right so I put one on that . <vocalsound> Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . No no that's um <disfmarker> I didn't know how else to do it . I think we should look at the ones that <vocalsound> like where s where people said four , where <disfmarker> um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one . Mm-hmm . Do <disfmarker> does every ones have the slide ? Three point one . The <disfmarker> that was material . Slide show . Material <vocalsound> technologically innovative , okay . Um , Mm . do you want to change it ? What are the suggestions ? I don't know , anyone ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ? Mm-hmm . Yeah that <disfmarker> it's three point one was not that good . Four point one . Does the shape <disfmarker> The shape . I think <disfmarker> Four point two ? See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining the <disfmarker> is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It <disfmarker> I think the wheel would probably be <disfmarker> mm . or bigger ? Because <disfmarker> What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And like then it <disfmarker> you could hold it in your hand better . I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish . Yeah . No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get <disfmarker> Yeah . that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of <disfmarker> The flat one . Yeah . Yeah . so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position . I didn't <disfmarker> yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat <disfmarker> Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . And would it even resemble fruit that way ? <vocalsound> I mean <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah like certain ones <disfmarker> you'd have to limit the fruit selection , Yeah . like you could probably do a strawberry still . Yeah . I think the broccoli would be out . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You could do <gap> , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like <disfmarker> sorta like a joystick . Yeah that I I <disfmarker> when you were holding that before , it actually looked <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . That looked really good . I don't know . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ? Uh . Not that I can think of . Rhubarb . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think that broccoli is my favourite actually . <vocalsound> Rhubarb . <vocalsound> These obscure fruits . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh despite the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think we needn't <disfmarker> What if um the <disfmarker> it was just patterns on like <disfmarker> we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . Huh ? You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah . Oh okay . So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry . Yeah . That could work . Yeah . <gap> Or I mean we could even have fruit like around <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . I mean <disfmarker> Yeah . I dunno . But if we if we need <disfmarker> Yeah and just have the colour match or something . yeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the <disfmarker> Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Mm . Or like <disfmarker> I dunno , <vocalsound> some of 'em you can kind of think <disfmarker> see as like <disfmarker> like you could <disfmarker> if it was only this <disfmarker> you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable . Yeah . Yeah . So like maybe that's just too big Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , because <disfmarker> Yeah it's sorta like a joystick . which is a nice kind of <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . But <disfmarker> <gap> I dunno . I guess <disfmarker> I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? 'Cause like kind of <disfmarker> We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Or like even <disfmarker> Dif We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . Or even like <disfmarker> Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . Yeah . You know ? Yeah . Like uh we could do <disfmarker> I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped . 'Cause that , I think <disfmarker> I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And you still have the comfort of holding it like that . Yeah . Mm . And you could <disfmarker> like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Alright . But I mean it <disfmarker> do we have any other ideas about that ? Um <disfmarker> We could tr I don't know . Think the critical ones came out to be <disfmarker> yeah that one . <vocalsound> . Batteries easy to insert for some reason , <vocalsound> which can be easily <disfmarker> I think that's not a problem any more . The batteries are going in the back ? That <disfmarker> everyone gave that a one or a two . Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote . No . The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one <disfmarker> I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip <disfmarker> No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door , no you could <disfmarker> Just like any other one . yeah um like on a normal remote . Okay . Yeah . Right . So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably . Okay . I think everyone's under three anyway . Mm . So I think it's <disfmarker> yeah those are the only two points . Cool . Well <disfmarker> Yeah the broccoli I guess wins . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape . Yeah . Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We were a bit off task . <vocalsound> Um so uh I can't think of any <disfmarker> So we'll have to like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah I dunno . You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , but you could do like <disfmarker> It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . Yeah that's true . Yeah . Yeah . And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular . Yeah that's true . Mm . I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . Yeah . Which is why printing might be like <disfmarker> just printing the fruit on <disfmarker> <vocalsound> fruit . <vocalsound> Hmm . Mm . <vocalsound> Not really <disfmarker> Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . <vocalsound> Um so project evaluation . Do you want this and we can all <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No . I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied <disfmarker> oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah . It's alright yeah ? Um <disfmarker> Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of <disfmarker> Sure . Yeah . I did . Yeah . I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sponginess . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The prototype making was very creatively stimulating <vocalsound> and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria <vocalsound> . And how was our leadership and teamwork ? <vocalsound> I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . Well I thought my leadership was crap personally . <vocalsound> Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Um . I think you were fine . You did a good job leading . Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together . Yeah we didn't <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> uh it all c sort of blended quite well . Yeah . Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like <vocalsound> I don't know , all had ideas about it but <disfmarker> Yeah . Very democratic . <vocalsound> yeah . No spats , that was good . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um and the means for like <disfmarker> the materials we used , how convenient were they ? Like the the pens , the whiteboard , <vocalsound> I mean we used <disfmarker> Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . Are you a Mac person ? <vocalsound> No no I never touch Macs either . <vocalsound> I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things . Huh . Hmm . Which isn't very user-friendly though . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well the problem is if you don't <disfmarker> like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now . But yeah I mean I guess it's okay . I felt like my <disfmarker> I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my <disfmarker> the information that was available to me was kind of just like <disfmarker> or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda <disfmarker> it was kinda like okay , I don't really think <disfmarker> I dunno what I'm doing here . <vocalsound> Mm . So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations , Yeah . so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , <vocalsound> think it's kinda stupid . Yeah . Yeah . I never use it . Yeah but uh <disfmarker> I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . Yeah . Like I <disfmarker> It didn't really <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . It <disfmarker> I though it was brilliant no ? <vocalsound> My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . Really ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think . <vocalsound> Yeah it probably does . So like a f I mean m my problem <disfmarker> I think it depends on the role no ? Yeah I think so . yeah , yeah . 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like <disfmarker> they'd put <disfmarker> send you to sites and stuff right ? Yeah . See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . And when you were talking about it I was just like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things , 'cause I <disfmarker> Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . Yeah . <vocalsound> As if you'd wanted to . Yeah . Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um System . a whole system , Yeah . 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah I mean , it <gap> Yeah . Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Yeah , huh . It seems planned you know . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah I kinda thought that um <disfmarker> I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated <vocalsound> because <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I dunno Yeah . I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um <disfmarker> Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like <disfmarker> we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? <vocalsound> Yeah . No . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So it's <disfmarker> If I hadn't been told that fruit was <disfmarker> But I think that <vocalsound> it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . Oh right . given certain information or <disfmarker> Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input <disfmarker> Just <disfmarker> yeah . I don't have a clue , anyway . Mm , mm . Um what's next ? Looks like <disfmarker> oh no that's not um <disfmarker> It's quite <disfmarker> What do you guys think of the pens ? It asks about that . They're pretty cool . Mm . They're kinda hard to write with though . I wanna s Yeah Yeah . and I I've f forgotten once or twice to <vocalsound> check the box . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the <disfmarker> They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write . Mm . But even so , I dunno . <vocalsound> And new ideas found ? <vocalsound> Yeah it's all very new , <vocalsound> Yeah . no ? It's all very new . Yeah I think I'd like to um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I dunno . Like it was <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> Sorry . I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're <disfmarker> like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like . Oh yeah . Well they drop off if you like move too much . Yeah I dunno . But they're they're okay . But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . Maybe we are . I don't know . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I think , and I think that uh Mm . all this technology like <disfmarker> I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , Yeah . Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company , or like <disfmarker> I dunno . and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . Like usually I missed meetings deliberately . There's just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . Yeah . Hm . It's mostly like rehashing old stuff . And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . Yeah . It's like the <disfmarker> there's just really not a lot of information that goes through . Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . It seems like way overkill . Yeah . Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . Yeah . I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and <disfmarker> Yeah . I guess it would be <disfmarker> it's gotta be worth it to <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . How about a p <vocalsound> a <gap> <vocalsound> ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um I dunno . Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Any other ideas for <disfmarker> What what's the end ? Are we are we supposed to um <disfmarker> you supposed to write a report ? Or we ending ? Um we still have time if there's any other input . Is that the end ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean the <disfmarker> I think we did really well personally , which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly . 'Cause I mean we've all <disfmarker> we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . <vocalsound> <gap> Yeah . <vocalsound> So . Um . End of meeting . You have to tell her , she <disfmarker> So I think that's all for today . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay we have to fill in all this stuff . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Stuff stuff stuff . M meeting adjourned . Meeting adjourned . Yeah . I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think it would be a good idea , I like it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . Especially if you have food . So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . 'Cause <disfmarker> All of us ? I don't know . Hmm . Well there's al eight , nine . <vocalsound> Ooh . Oh ooh . Hmm . Or is that just me ? <vocalsound>
Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . <vocalsound> Alright so twenty five . Mm 'kay . So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . <vocalsound> So yeah , I've <disfmarker> The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things Yeah the universal ones . Yeah . where they're , yeah . Mm . So presumably that might be an idea to put into . But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure . Slim . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Uh 'cause I mean , what <disfmarker> uh twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? Mm-hmm , it's about that . And that's quite a lot for a remote control . Yeah , yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control <gap> functions , Uh-huh . so maybe we could think about colour ? Mm-hmm . Make <disfmarker> that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , Okay . you know those things ? <vocalsound> The the keyrings , yeah yeah . Because we always lose our remote control . Right . <vocalsound> Uh yeah uh , Okay , that's cool . being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? <gap> Okay . What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , Okay . like <disfmarker> and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with <gap> or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <gap> They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , Yeah . Okay . so , yes , 'Kay . all this . Uh , what do we think a <disfmarker> So , we're looking for <disfmarker> <gap> 'Kay . What do we think a good size would be for this ? <gap> We're <disfmarker> <gap> Sorry , <vocalsound> 'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky carry on . <vocalsound> Yeah . and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . <vocalsound> Then you lose it , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like , For for uh 'cause <disfmarker> remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . <vocalsound> Yeah . No , I wasn't , no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ Okay well right but we'll have to um <disfmarker> I'll <disfmarker> we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um Okay . we should all look into a bit uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . So you do the looking around at other remote controls . Yeah . Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um <vocalsound> basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how <disfmarker> what sort of materials are available to you whatever . And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . Right . Which will probably just usurp what I said so <disfmarker> So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? Shapes and colours and <disfmarker> um basically how to make it attractive . Yep . Okay . Uh . Mm-hmm . <gap> And you look at competition and design . Yep . Cool . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> So we have uh <disfmarker> <gap> Wait for emails ? Uh . <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , groovy . And no doubt we'll get um <disfmarker> Oh no , <gap> . Sorry Sorry . it's okay . We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well . Okay , cool . <vocalsound> Okay . I shall <disfmarker> I can't imagine these <gap> are worth much . <vocalsound> Okay . Hmm . Fashion into electronic . Okay .
Okay . Um welcome to our second meeting . This is the functional design meeting . And I hope you all had a good individual working time . Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . And then we're gonna close up the meeting . And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . <gap> Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of <disfmarker> 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Oh , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> well let's go ahead and , <vocalsound> <gap> back , previous . So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . Who would like to start us off ? I don't mind going first . 'Kay . Okay . Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ? Yeah , it's in the <disfmarker> should be in the m Project . Okay . Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or <disfmarker> You know you could you could do it yourself actually . Oh . Did you send it ? Save it in the project documents . Put it in Project Documents , yeah . Okay . Mm-mm-mm . This one ? Sure . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . Okay . Great . Okay . Um well , the function <vocalsound> of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . <vocalsound> And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . <gap> And we can decide if that's what we want , <gap> , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . Okay . Okay . These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , <vocalsound> and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is <disfmarker> fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating . Right . And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . Okay . Ready . And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . <gap> So that's it . Alright . Very good presentation . Thank you . You speak with such authority on the matter . Mm . Left . <vocalsound> Okay . Who would like to um follow that one up ? Now , that we've discussed <disfmarker> I can go . Okay . Do you want me to run it or you wanna <disfmarker> Yeah , you should run it . Okay . <vocalsound> Functional requirements . <vocalsound> Mm yes . 'Kay . Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the <vocalsound> users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Seventy five percent think they're ugly . Eighty percent want <disfmarker> they've <disfmarker> are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they <disfmarker> it needs to be snazzy and it <disfmarker> but yet simple . So that's really what we need to do . <gap> Wait . And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So <disfmarker> And that meaning what ? Like <disfmarker> They like I guess use the buttons a lot . Okay . Yeah . <gap> I don't know . It's from my uh research . Right . Okay , what do you m My team wasn't very clear . Only use ten percent of the buttons . Oh , I'm sorry . <vocalsound> That's okay . What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . I I think it's like the engineering versus user , Okay . whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex Oh , right . and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . The buttons . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . Okay . We only use ten per cent of our brains . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good point . It works . It's a necessary evil . <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> Ready for the next slide ? Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , Hmm . much like any small appliance like a cellphone , Lost . and they <disfmarker> we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go <disfmarker> we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , S but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . It's okay . It's very important . <vocalsound> Yes , it is important for the remote control world . Wait , <vocalsound> is that like your <disfmarker> ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? Sh Could be , yeah . Uh possibly . Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? Like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I Channel , volume , power . don't know . I think that's a pretty good guess though . Yeah , I would assume so . <vocalsound> I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . It's like if you're holding it <disfmarker> Yeah . It's okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . Okay . Next slide ? Yes . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . User-friendly . Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in <disfmarker> like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . <gap> And also we found <disfmarker> our team found that speech recognition is <disfmarker> it's like an up-and-coming thing they really <disfmarker> consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . And so just to <disfmarker> just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? I guess so , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , that'd be lovely . Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . Yeah . <vocalsound> Didn't they <disfmarker> um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would <disfmarker> the remote would beep so if you have lost it <disfmarker> It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . You know like go to the base . We could definitely include that if we wanted to . Yeah . If it's within our price . Okay . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? Yeah , I'm just trying to move it . Okay . 'Kay . I think it should be there , working design . Working design . There we go . <vocalsound> 'Kay . 'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . Oh my bad . <vocalsound> Oh that's fine . Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . Help me . We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . <vocalsound> What exactly is a smart chip ? Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . Mm-hmm . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . Okay . Ready ? Um yep , nothing here . <vocalsound> That's okay . Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . <gap> Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . Um a large on-off button , <vocalsound> demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . <vocalsound> <gap> Hmm . Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . Um smart chip that perverts <disfmarker> uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . <gap> Uh this is my fifty second design . <vocalsound> Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? This is just like a rough schematic . So this would be the front ? So this is the internal workings . So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? Oh okay . Yeah . Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , Okay . but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . The l <vocalsound> the light up kind of <disfmarker> Like that we know the battery's working . Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? Yeah . Hmm . Okay . It'd probably be lighting up the key too , We can skip that whole thing . right ? Yep . Yeah . Yeah . 'Kay . So you can put it in the dark . <vocalsound> The buttons . Yeah , and that's good . We should make it glow in the dark . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , definitely . 'Kay nex R Ready ? Yeah , that's it . 'Kay , any p 'Kay ? <vocalsound> Mm 'kay . Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . I think that that's a good idea , Anything else ? because you know that's one of the most important buttons . Just <disfmarker> Okay . Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? I think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in <disfmarker> like in <disfmarker> for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , Mm . I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . Ovals . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay , let's talk about all of our <disfmarker> We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and <vocalsound> I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . <vocalsound> Wait , come back . Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . <vocalsound> Okay . It's not gonna be multi-functional . <gap> Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . We're trying to get our name out there in the world . <gap> Okay . And you know what teletext is ? Yeah . <gap> in States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , I know . What is it ? <vocalsound> it's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen , Yeah , it's like black , black and white kind of <disfmarker> not even <disfmarker> Yeah , just black with just text . Like running along the bottom ? Yeah . You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so <disfmarker> It'll give you the sports . Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? Kind of . Except the entire screen . It's the entire screen is just running information at random . Yeah it's the whole screen . You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , So anyway <disfmarker> Seemingly . you know it's like <disfmarker> So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? Right . Right . Yeah . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , <vocalsound> and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so <disfmarker> Those are our new product requirements . Okay . Okay . So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? Alright . Mm-hmm . Yes . It's part of the logo . Okay . Company colour being yellow . <vocalsound> What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright . <gap> Whatever . Okay . So our target group is <disfmarker> You mentioned um older people ? Mm-hmm . Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically <disfmarker> It's gonna make it nicer . Yeah . non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so <disfmarker> Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , Yeah . Yeah . then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ? No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . <gap> They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range <disfmarker> Yeah , I think we need it all . Um what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? <gap> Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person . We should go for the lowest denominator . Okay . Yeah . Right , okay . High school educated . So so they need no technical experience to operate <disfmarker> <gap> how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . Mm-hmm , volume . And channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones . Right . And we wanna keep um <disfmarker> I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent . Yeah . 'Kay . Hey , what else ? Um . Um . <vocalsound> Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? I think so . What do you <disfmarker> Sure , yeah . <gap> A finding kind of device or <disfmarker> And I need <disfmarker> we we need a like homing device . like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? Yeah , ho homing device . <vocalsound> Oh right yeah okay . Mm 'kay . Tracking . Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . Okay . Right . What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , But you got a base . and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . Do you think people'll really go for that though ? Because <disfmarker> It's useful for the remote phone . Hmm . Yeah . Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . Right . Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . Yeah . Hmm . Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . Yeah . Okay . I I think we can make a decision about that later . Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . So that would include battery source <disfmarker> Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . Right . Do w Well , then we could <disfmarker> If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . Mm . Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge You could um It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , <disfmarker> we could hook it up . Oh . but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So <vocalsound> basically older people don't really care . It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . <gap> I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . Mm-hmm . They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has <disfmarker> just sitcoms and stuff . Right . So <disfmarker> Well , then then do you put the voice recognition <disfmarker> do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , Right . whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . Yeah . <gap> and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . Right . A certain phrase then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there . Yeah . Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Still <gap> fifteen minutes . Um . Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ? Um . Wait , on the remote itself ? Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . <gap> Well , we definitely need those . How how , yeah , how would you leave those out ? Yeah . Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can <gap> like well <disfmarker> I don't know , Unless you could say the channel . if there's just a way of leaving them out ? I think people would find that too foreign . Yeah . Yeah , that's true . You definitely need <disfmarker> And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . <vocalsound> So I couldn't <disfmarker> whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . It's when we get satellite . Mm . <gap> get your own remote , or digital cable . Yeah . 'Kay . Um . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um . Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so <disfmarker> 'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . The colour being yellow ? Wait . I'm guessing . And how do we <disfmarker> I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . And the R_R_ . R_ the double R_ . We could just have the logo in yellow , Can't make it entirely <disfmarker> or maybe a yellow light for the keys . Or is the l Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights . Yeah , <vocalsound> yellow could be and it could <disfmarker> doesn't have to be huge . Yeah . Well if you have like a <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Hang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom <gap> the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . Right . So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , Right , yeah . Yeah . or no menu buttons . So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um can we go back to <disfmarker> I'm gonna look really quickly back at those Two examples . examples Yeah . and see if there is anything . Which one is yours , technical functions Oh , it's a <disfmarker> or functional requirement ? Yeah . Okay . Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? The T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . Hmm . Yeah , 'cause we need to <disfmarker> we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . and so it's like <disfmarker> It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , I don't <disfmarker> well , I don't know . you know ? Right . So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . Well , that could be <disfmarker> For the menus . No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . Mm-hmm . That's true . Yeah , okay . Channel is just up and down . Okay , yeah . And then add a <disfmarker> Something that looks mayb you know . Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . Y right , right right right . Yeah . That one ? So we just have it like <disfmarker> add a menu button then for the various things needed , Right . including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now In the middle perhaps . included in the menu . Yep . Ooh , I just got an idea for a design . <gap> good . Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? I had something , but I forgot . <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> get out of here . Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm . Alright . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . And then we're gonna have lunch break . And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . Um I'm gonna put the minutes <disfmarker> I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . 'Kay . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? No ? Okay , well , this meeting is officially over . Thank you all .
Two . <vocalsound> Good morning . Hello . Hello . Hello . Ah . You have to put it exactly on the on the <disfmarker> Plate ? <vocalsound> yeah . Okay . Good morning . Good morning . I took your mouse . Should I bring my uh pen too ? Yeah just <disfmarker> yeah , Or <disfmarker> no , that's for me , I just have to make some notes . <vocalsound> Okay . I got my uh mouse . Uh I also forgot my mouse , Mouse . <gap> <vocalsound> yeah . but I don't need my mouse , I think . I do . Come on . There we are . My laptop is crashing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Damn computers . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Cr <vocalsound> Help help help . Let's just check one more time . Mm . Can you hear me ? Hello ? Test . Uh actually my laptop doesn't work , I dunno . <gap> switch it on again . Check . Oh no . Okay . I think it works . Test test . Yes , it's working . So you all read what we are going to do or not ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Yeah . We're gonna make a remote control . Yeah , that's right . I think my laptop is a bit <vocalsound> etchy . I just made a a simple uh presentation . So you <gap> put some things in it . <vocalsound> Okay . How does this work ? I dunno . <gap> One uh <disfmarker> most to the right . Uh p Yes that one . This one ? Yes . Press F_ eleven . Ah cool . <vocalsound> Okay . So that's my name , <gap> . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to <disfmarker> uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . So um the <gap> thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things <disfmarker> or , not yet , Yes . okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly <gap> that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it <disfmarker> that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for <disfmarker> what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . <vocalsound> Okay so <disfmarker> uh no , this is a <disfmarker> these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . And you already saw <disfmarker> you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . Folder , yes . Folder , okay . So no okay <gap> have a look at that one . Okay . So uh what we're going to do first is um so you can read . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and um and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have <disfmarker> this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . Yes ? Ah I can see it now . Yeah . Okay . This a new page , it's okay . Use pen format . and a different colour can use here <gap> no I just take the pink . You take <disfmarker> oh there's no pink , okay , oh Purple . just purple , okay . No blue . And uh line width <vocalsound> ten . Okay uh just take <disfmarker> what I'm going to draw is an elephant . Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . It's a very nice elephant , you can see . I dunno what it looks <disfmarker> but it doesn't matter . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Looks very nice . <vocalsound> I just h Something like this ? Oh no <gap> <vocalsound> It look like a dinosaurs . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . <vocalsound> A pink elephant . Because I like <disfmarker> uh okay . <vocalsound> Just takes so long , okay . Whatever , just . You erased this one . It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . Okay . Okay , so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . Let me try one . Just don't um <disfmarker> yeah , just u use it like that , yeah . That's okay . Okay . <gap> Mm . Okay and then uh what's the colour ? How do I do <disfmarker> It's in format . Yeah . Ah . I'll take this one . Uh there has to be water , Just <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No it has to be an animal , so if that's it's <disfmarker> Yeah yeah , it should be a shna snake or something . but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . Okay . Okay okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> The water is important . <vocalsound> So I first uh draw the water . <vocalsound> Uh . Okay , <vocalsound> and now I make the animal . It's a fish . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wow . Okay , cool . Mm-hmm . So . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is a worm . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> Hmm yeah , that's nice . <vocalsound> Wow . <vocalsound> Okay , who next ? Uh <disfmarker> Uh do you have to write down why <disfmarker> uh that doesn't matter , just <disfmarker> it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay . Okay . Just make a new blank new blank page . Yeah . Well Paul ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Like this ? Yeah , not too far to the to the t pen top . <vocalsound> Okay . Um let's make it um a dog . Ooh . Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that <disfmarker> no , to the <disfmarker> yeah . <gap> I think it's a pig . Ah okay . A pig ? <vocalsound> I can make <disfmarker> No , Or a dog . it's a dog . <vocalsound> a dog . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> Um <disfmarker> A sheep ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh we d only have twenty five minutes , so <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Take it easy . 'Kay , I make a cat of it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I was gonna make a cat too . <vocalsound> Use your fantasy . <vocalsound> Oh , not too quick . Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have <gap> No I have it . okay . I just draw too quick I think . Okay , that's it . More . No , that's okay , thank you . <vocalsound> It's just to get used to it . Okay . I thought these pens would be just um <disfmarker> uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No . No , not yet , okay . Yeah , that's right , it <disfmarker> but you actually got to write on the paper . But it's just <disfmarker> Sorry ? You really got to write on that paper . Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word , Yeah yeah , it's a real pen . Yeah , so that's not but it's just a picture . just <disfmarker> it's just a picture . Oh . So <vocalsound> You really <disfmarker> Y you can you can't edit in the <disfmarker> edit it in Word . it's not that cool as I th thought it would be . No . No . Oh , okay . It's a donkey . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure . Uh I think it was uh <disfmarker> Half past . Half past ten . Yeah . Okay . Brilliant . Okay , Nice , perfect . eh ? <vocalsound> Yep . Yeah , thank you . Now we just have to save everything , so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> this is definitely the best one . <vocalsound> Uh . Okay , so uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros . Excuse me . Okay , that's <gap> . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe . Piece of cake . The production cost are about half the price of selling price , sorry . Uh easy . So can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have <gap> a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the <gap> and everything , so just have a look how it <disfmarker> we think about remote controls . Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a <vocalsound> a universal remote control ? Oh yeah , that's a good question . Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . I think it's <disfmarker> I'm not I'm not sure , So I <disfmarker> it's not mm <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> Yeah , it probably would be universal . Universal . Because <disfmarker> <gap> And only television ? Or more devices ? I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so <disfmarker> not sure , but <disfmarker> Hmm , maybe , Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros I don't know . Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Yeah , I think . Ah okay . Okay , perfect . And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and <disfmarker> Yeah , everything just <disfmarker> okay . so a lot of buttons <vocalsound> on the remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah , probably . Not just a T_V_ . No , just everything . Okay . <gap> . so yeah , Okay . what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not <disfmarker> nothing very special , but um <disfmarker> Well we can try to make it special . yeah , that's right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability Well <disfmarker> Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , or user <vocalsound> <gap> <disfmarker> we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . <vocalsound> Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons . Um I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh <vocalsound> use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . Hmm yeah . <vocalsound> That's right . Should be a good point . Yeah . Okay . Nothing <gap> And how big should it be ? N No . Yeah . <gap> It shouldn't be too big , I dunno um <disfmarker> but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so . Yeah . We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think . Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . Yeah . Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . Yeah . Yeah . Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , Yes maybe more trendy . But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . Fold open , where you can see uh more options . I think <disfmarker> Okay , yeah , that's cool . Ah that's that's <disfmarker> Yeah Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , n Yeah , if you just <disfmarker> something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . Ah right right . Yeah , or you c Yeah . Oh O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . that's good , yeah . Yeah b I wanted <disfmarker> Yeah . Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? <vocalsound> Uh maybe be uh it's it's <disfmarker> There are buttons on it . No you can make an uh manual in it . Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . Okay . Yeah , But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . but But that's <disfmarker> Uh like a a to have <disfmarker> Yeah , I think it's much uh <disfmarker> too expensive . Yeah Yeah , maybe it would . but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . <gap> And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , Yeah . because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken . Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . Yeah , too fragile . Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh <disfmarker> No . You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . <vocalsound> Kid-proof . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah <gap> . <vocalsound> And uh how about the batteries ? Um <disfmarker> Uh should you put it in a recharger or a <disfmarker> just <disfmarker> Oh maybe that's a good idea , Ma maybe a home station . just to put it on your television and just s recharge , Yeah . you never have to use any batteries . Mm yeah . Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think . Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ? Yeah . Yeah , I dunno . Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ? I dunno . Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , <vocalsound> Ah yeah . but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . <gap> Maybe have <gap> uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably <disfmarker> it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . Yeah , 'cause well <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are <disfmarker> uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place . Yeah , that's right , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Maybe it's <disfmarker> Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive . Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately . Yeah . You can <disfmarker> yeah , you can buy it with it . Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh <disfmarker> Rechargeable . Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , Yeah . or you can change your batteries , Oh yeah . so . The option , just the option , that's cool . Yeah . Uh I I set something on paper already , <gap> size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , Yeah . uh it has to lay good in the hand , Yeah . you you have to uh <disfmarker> Has it be <disfmarker> has <disfmarker> does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know or <disfmarker> Well if we <disfmarker> I think we have to look at that , 'cause well you can do <gap> the standard way , but then you won't <disfmarker> You can make it very special , to create our own um looks , Yeah but it's very hard to <disfmarker> N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . Nah . Well you can um have uh <vocalsound> the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . Yeah . But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . Yeah . So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , Yeah . so you can do something unique with that . And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you <vocalsound> can still uh do the th the functions . Yeah yeah , what Paul already said . Uh on on top are the the basic options on top , Yeah . Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine . But n <vocalsound> yeah , Yeah , yeah . but uh i <vocalsound> and if you fold it open <disfmarker> basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , But maybe it's <gap> Yeah <gap> . That's what I meant . so . maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh <disfmarker> what's it's called ? Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an <disfmarker> uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . <gap> Maybe it's hard t Uh <disfmarker> No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control <gap> . Okay , but yeah . Just think about it . Yeah . We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . Okay . There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to <disfmarker> what you have to do ? Okay . Yeah . Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , what you want to do with it . Yeah , I think this <disfmarker> if you <disfmarker> you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Okay . Yeah , Also from a user , but all these things together . it's also about strength and uh for everything uh . Yeah , everything . Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff that you want on a <disfmarker> Yeah , no maybe not not uh <gap> , that's not a f that's something for for for <disfmarker> yeah . Technical fun fu That's not for you . Okay . Just if <disfmarker> what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . I already wrote some down , some ideas . Yeah , it's alright . Yep . Yeah , just <disfmarker> is that okay ? Okay . Yep . Okay . Okay . There's already a document in the folder about it . Yeah , me too . So see you in thirty minutes . Okay , well done . Okay . Okay . For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so <disfmarker> your laptop . I will . Oh Paul . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It didn't say that . No , sorry . Your fault . Ciao . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bye bye . Bye bye .
Okay . Here we go . Alright , the agenda for thi oh . Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting <vocalsound> is um <disfmarker> we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group . Okay . And um <disfmarker> So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ? Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them . Alright . Thank you . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Do you want to present it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is what we came up with . Yeah , here we are . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . <vocalsound> And <vocalsound> we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mango shape . On ? <vocalsound> A mango . Okay . Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here The L_E_D_ . and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind <disfmarker> Oh . Okay . yeah . I'm sorry . What was the <disfmarker> where's the L_E_D_ ? Oops . It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . Oh . Okay . And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be So it's palm-held . accessible from your thumb <disfmarker> yeah palm-held Yeah . and all the Yeah . buttons are accessible from your thumb . Notice you have a number ten button . So you don't have to <disfmarker> Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Right no , that's a zero . You just need the nought . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Take that one off . <vocalsound> Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No problem . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah . And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . So one plus one would be eleven , <vocalsound> You can go one , three or something . or <disfmarker> Oh . You press that first and then you go one three You press a plus button ? yeah . Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before . Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and <disfmarker> Yeah Yeah . because if you <disfmarker> on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to <disfmarker> um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . Yeah . Oh , there's no e okay . So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . So the plus and then <disfmarker> Oh . yeah . I Okay . But <disfmarker> Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? No no , th all <disfmarker> that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um these numbers all work independently up to nine . <vocalsound> Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . Yeah . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? Sixty . You p Oh . No you press the plus first . I I <disfmarker> well it doesn't <disfmarker> Oh . we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , <vocalsound> but she says plus <disfmarker> <vocalsound> press <disfmarker> which <disfmarker> Well I don't mind , we can further define that . what do you think is simpler ? I th It's a <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . Yeah . Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . Yeah . But I was just wondering But I suppose it's not as snappy . like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . Well the there is a <disfmarker> there's a delay on remotes I think . Oops . Where you can have it <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . it's like a five second input time . Yeah . If you don't put it <disfmarker> So as long as you hit them dada Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> it should be fine . Yeah . As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Was there <disfmarker> so on the top there is volume and <disfmarker> And channel , A channel . which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like <disfmarker> Channel up volume up . Okay cool . C_ and V_ . Just so we can flick <disfmarker> Right , Yeah . where um where's the power button ? It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . <vocalsound> It's the bigger R_ . It's the R_ . Oh okay . So it's just like <vocalsound> . Yeah , so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote . Yeah . We deci Yeah . Yeah Mm-hmm . um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . Oh okay . Uh e ergonomics are all considered . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And <vocalsound> it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . <vocalsound> It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . Okay . <vocalsound> But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The spon yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , Yeah . and it just feels feels different . Yeah . Bit of a stress ball feel . Yeah . <vocalsound> Would you like to feel it yourselves ? Yes . I would . <vocalsound> How it fits in the palm of your hand ? My goodness . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thanks . <vocalsound> There you go . And you ? <vocalsound> Yes Genevieve ? Yeah . <vocalsound> . Oh it's nice . Oh I think I killed the five . <vocalsound> I did . I killed the four . And something hmm . <vocalsound> Oh god . <vocalsound> O Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . Oh it smells good . <vocalsound> Of Play Doh yeah . But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination . Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , Oh right . or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and <disfmarker> more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . Yeah . It looks more <disfmarker> Think like vanilla and banana would . Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company <disfmarker> the yellow and black . Yeah . Okay yeah . So that <disfmarker> for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the <disfmarker> Kinda Christmas , you know . yeah , seasonal . Yeah , yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki <disfmarker> Yeah . The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated <vocalsound> customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . Cool . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . Yeah . Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it . Alright , thank you very much . <vocalsound> Good work everyone . <vocalsound> Bravo <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . Mm-hmm . So , I have something I'm going to <disfmarker> You want the <disfmarker> Oh wait a minute . Do you need to do a presentation first ? <vocalsound> I don't know what order it goes in . Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second . I have one . Mm go <disfmarker> <gap> What time is it anyw Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation cri Okay . Evaluation criteria is next in line . That's me . Yeah . Hello . Oh there we go . Okay . Come on my computer . Come on . <vocalsound> Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . Just press um function eight again . Should I press it again ? Last time I did that it sh Okay . You're right . And then again I think . One more time . Oh . Still not there . Yeah . Yeah . Okay now I think for this one I could <disfmarker> Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on <disfmarker> right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . Um and looking looking back at my notes from our <disfmarker> both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . <vocalsound> Okay so question number one . Does the remote <disfmarker> whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able <disfmarker> um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . Okay . I'll write down our scores up on the <disfmarker> Ooh . Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? Mm . Feel I think . We've been quite successful with the rubber coating Yeah . and <disfmarker> The look is a little bit more playful . Well <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . It's not your traditional <disfmarker> Oh definitely different yeah . yeah . I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean <vocalsound> th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . Mm-hmm . Yeah . It's not the kind of <disfmarker> ooh uh at all sleek Oh you were only given red and black ? <disfmarker> red , black and yellow , and orange . Oh okay . Yeah <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> not very sleek <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . Yeah . So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . Yeah . But if you can imagine that in like a s just a <disfmarker> maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Well I know know it's for rubber . Yeah . Polished . I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . <vocalsound> Okay <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I kinda <disfmarker> I like the potato look . <vocalsound> Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . <vocalsound> We we were <vocalsound> we were thinking about <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's mango . <vocalsound> It's very different . It's what ? It's mango . <vocalsound> Oh sorry the mango the mango look . <vocalsound> Potato's fine . Potato's fine . <vocalsound> Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable . So I myself would say a one or a two . Yeah . I would say two . Personally . I w I'd say two I think . It's a two ? Okay , For the and p Fanciness . fancy <disfmarker> Yeah . One being true . So <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> uh two , Two . three . <vocalsound> Okay , Yeah . actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was <vocalsound> is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . Yeah . Yeah and the use of the rubber . <vocalsound> Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . Yeah . For the anti-R_S_I_ . Yeah . The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative Isn't <disfmarker> Mm . and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . Mm-hmm . Yeah . In some aspects it is , like we said . Yeah . I'd say maybe three . I'll go for three as well . Yeah . And I think <disfmarker> I mean it it's tough to say because we were <disfmarker> we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . Yeah . Though it was our specification . No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah . Yeah we want it simple . So I mean I <disfmarker> we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ? I think so . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah very . Yeah . Yeah . S I think one for that . Yeah I think it's <disfmarker> Yeah . One . Yeah . you can't really get confused with that . Yeah . No . I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number <disfmarker> the plus system . Th The plus number thing . Yeah that's the only thing yeah . But once that's figured out , it should be fine . Yeah and perhaps the turning on but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? Mm . Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <vocalsound> It's definitely <disfmarker> Again I think the colour comes into this . Yeah colour will definitely be a factor . Mm-hmm <vocalsound> . I think that the logo could be smaller . Okay . Yeah . And maybe not such a prominent way . But the <disfmarker> Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . Not in <disfmarker> Whoops . Oh it just had to be on there I guess . Should just not touch it . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Don't worry . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This time it's the three I killed . <vocalsound> I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . Or <disfmarker> I suppose I've got quite big hands . I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . Well <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> But you know what I've just thought of there now . What <disfmarker> where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . and then the rest is like Yeah . But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand <vocalsound> . round . Oh . That's true . It would still be comfortable I think . <vocalsound> Yeah . Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . We c we could handle it I think . Maybe , it could <disfmarker> it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . Yeah . Like that . Oh that would be nice . <vocalsound> Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying . Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha . Yeah . I g If it's weighted maybe . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . <vocalsound> 'Kay we're done designing . <vocalsound> Details , details . <vocalsound> Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Come on . Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? <vocalsound> Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit <disfmarker> it's more interesting than other remotes . Yeah . I think , it was another colour and it was like <disfmarker> I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two . Yeah ? I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . Okay , so should we say two for that ? Sure . Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um <disfmarker> will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . I think we have to market it in the right way , that um <disfmarker> to say that it is simplistic . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . Yeah . We have to market it . Yeah it <disfmarker> the marketing will have a lot to do with it . Yeah . And <vocalsound> the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . Yeah . ooh no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Shake it and the buttons fall off . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Durable . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But you know , those'll be firmly on . <vocalsound> Don't shake <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh no the plus . <vocalsound> You're No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , <disfmarker> use the zero . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Make a new one . But you're our Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> I know I am , aren't I ? I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . But you don't have to buy batteries . Fifteen ? So in the long term this can actually save you money . Yeah . Mm , yeah , that's true . Oh . Exactly . Exactly . So we'll market it that way too . Yeah . Good point . So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . I would give it a two still though . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? <vocalsound> Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . Or <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics <disfmarker> Yeah . I think it does very well . Oh yeah . Because <disfmarker> we said <disfmarker> yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . The zap <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . And it's just <disfmarker> you won't have to think about it . Yeah . yeah . You don't have to look down to find them . <vocalsound> They're clearly there , easy to use . Yeah . Yeah Simple . I guess the <disfmarker> I think the key word there is average , Uh <disfmarker> 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . Yeah . But they're not you and I really . Mm . So . Yeah . Okay so one ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . Now is there the <disfmarker> We have the alarm system . is the alarm system still <disfmarker> was it implemented ? Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the <vocalsound> lights <vocalsound> behind the <disfmarker> and it'll vibra <vocalsound> It <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . It'll be again in the marketing . I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . Yeah . The light <disfmarker> it will . Or or was it gonna make a noise ? But <disfmarker> Yeah . But when the alarm's not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah But both <disfmarker> <vocalsound> . If you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You press the button it makes a noise <vocalsound> It turns into a duck and starts quacking . right ? Yeah . Yeah . You could s <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , that would be brilliant . Yeah . Awesome . Awesome . Yeah . <vocalsound> Here I am . I'd be tempted to <disfmarker> Well the thing is , if it was <disfmarker> had an alarm system , <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . Yeah . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . It would have to be in the market I though w it was gonna make a noise . Okay . Yeah . Alarm , Yeah but you still couldn't see it . but you can't see an alarm inside uh <disfmarker> the alarm system itself . It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . Okay . We <disfmarker> oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . But yeah , it'll be there . So we can <disfmarker> we could say that <disfmarker> Oh okay . Whoo . Okay . <vocalsound> Sorry . We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Yeah , totally . Yeah . Okay . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sorry Heather . That wasn't very clear . No problem , mm . Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . So it has to be <disfmarker> Totally . yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . So the plu the plus <disfmarker> The plus thing needs to be worked on . w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , Yeah . Yeah won't it ? Yeah . I think <disfmarker> just because it's <disfmarker> we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . Well <disfmarker> Yeah . Do <disfmarker> Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an <disfmarker> just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter . That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press <disfmarker> <gap> Mm . I don't know why . <vocalsound> Yeah but you don't have to press zeros . You could just press six enter , Oh okay . Right . And <disfmarker> or sixty six enter , y or one two enter . And then like twelve , enter . Alright , aye . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um , okay so we can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I'd say w yeah one . we'll say yes it's uh one ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Ooh . Mm . Question number nine . Oh . Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? Yeah . Injury . Um , which affected over a quarter of users . <vocalsound> Hmm . S I think so . It's like right in the <disfmarker> But if you're zapping <disfmarker> Your thumb might get a little bit uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's what I was thinking . yeah . I don't think it will f We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . Yeah , Yeah . the biology . But it is soft . Mm-hmm . It's soft , And that's kind of what the um and <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . And people could <disfmarker> the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . so <disfmarker> maybe it is but <disfmarker> I don't know what other options there are . I think we're getting <disfmarker> Yeah . that's true . Could <disfmarker> I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . Mm . So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So , one or two do you think ? I I'd say t I think <disfmarker> yeah , I think too . two . Yeah Two okay . Yeah . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Yes we did . Yeah . <vocalsound> Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> N We we can't really do that Is the yellow <disfmarker> because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . It won't stand out . So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . It sounds like the colour's something that we <disfmarker> Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . Yeah . Gray , yeah . So it could be grey on the banana one . Yeah , could be grey . Yeah . But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , depending on the <disfmarker> Yeah that's right , we didn't even rea So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . I think this is the the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . Okay . Perhaps a metallic Mm , yeah . or or <disfmarker> like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ? Yeah . That isn't rubber . And the buttons in the middle . <vocalsound> Okay Yeah . <vocalsound> So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ? Four I think . Four ? Well I don't <disfmarker> what do <disfmarker> what <disfmarker> Well we have good reasons for it , Hum . so we <disfmarker> but we can still put a a four ? Okay . Okay . Okay , and final question . <vocalsound> Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . <vocalsound> I would say so . <vocalsound> Following that briefing we did . But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . With the with the colours . Like um the colour scheme names and stuff . Yeah . No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? <vocalsound> I think I missed a few <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . they are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> okay . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more <disfmarker> That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . Mm-hmm . It is . I think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . Well we haven't got a big banana but <disfmarker> The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Be like <disfmarker> No . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe if it was scented . <vocalsound> Oh that would be class . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . There we go . That would be great . <vocalsound> Yeah we have money for that . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? Yes we do . So I <disfmarker> wh what was I gonna put for that ? A two for fashion ? Oh . I would say two . Yeah . Two . Okay . Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven It's <disfmarker> is <disfmarker> One point nine or something ? It's <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> I don't know these things . Between one and two . Um , between one and two . Between <disfmarker> okay . So that's pretty fantastic . Close to two . <vocalsound> Um . Yeah . Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . I got <disfmarker> Alright . Does that seem right then ? Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down . Okay . Mm . It seems like it should be more around two . Uh , aye . Yeah . Yeah . Uh , should've added five . Do we have an online calculator ? I'm attempting to do that <vocalsound> right now . <vocalsound> This is <gap> . Okay . Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh . Yay . Oh wow . Well done . Go Heather Pauls . Well that's excellent . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . And um my computer's frozen . And now it's not . Okay . So um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um Sorry . I'm going to um steal a cable . Are you gonna do that ? Okay . Um it's it's um Is that the project document ? it's an Excel file . Oh . Production costs . Yeah . Yeah . 'Kay there we go . Um , production costs . And um I have to access that as well . It says it <disfmarker> One moment . <vocalsound> 'Kay so far I've added what I think <disfmarker> or what is going on ? Great . It's blinking at me . It's locked for editing . Read only . I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . I have the original in my um my email account . Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ? I dunno . I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . Or <disfmarker> okay . Have you have you completed it ? No . Oh right . Okay . No , I was hoping that you guys could . Okay . Um , there we go . <vocalsound> Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , Yeah . oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh right . Um we're using a regular chip . Yeah . Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . Double double-curved yeah . That's another three . We're already at five . Um , we're using plastic and rubber , Yeah . so <disfmarker> Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . Um <disfmarker> What about a special colour ? S Are we using that ? Yeah . I guess we should do it just for one kind . Yeah . So it's like special colour <disfmarker> well we'll have two colours right ? Yeah . Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . Mm-hmm . So we can <disfmarker> Yeah . Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . And a special material . And a special material . Yeah . Oof . Which puts us just barely under budget . Hurray . Congratulations guys . Mm . 'S good . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Good work guys . So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . That's good . Awesome . And back to our PowerPoint . So we've <disfmarker> 'Kay . Yes we are . <vocalsound> So we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably um <disfmarker> I dunno . A different extension of a <disfmarker> Of the actual project rather than the product ? Yeah . Hmm . A project ? Is is <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . Yeah . Alright so um <disfmarker> Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? I think we were pushed . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Pushed for creativity ? I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . The ma Or materials . <vocalsound> Yeah . So I think we could've done with a bit more time . <vocalsound> Ye Okay . So it'd be like need more time and materials . Yeah . But you were allowed m creativity ? Yeah . I think so as like <disfmarker> but you were supposed to have creativ Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m Yeah . Yeah . Well we were just limited by resources really When we can down to it . and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . Yeah . Okay . Right . So that did limit Creativity . creativity . Right <vocalsound> Just resources . Mm-hmm . Okay But yeah . The fruit and veg idea . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Great . <vocalsound> Leadership ? <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . Yeah . Yeah we did . Yeah . We've , uh <disfmarker> seeing as we've come out with what we intended . A pro um a product within the budget . I think that's a sign of good leadership Mm-hmm . and also our personal coach helped us along the way , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so you know <disfmarker> Yeah . And the timing was good . I think it's been fine . We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Good timing . Oop <gap> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And project manager of course . Teamwork ? I think we worked great as a team . Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Was good teamwork . I think we are well-suited to our roles . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright how were our means ? Um <disfmarker> We needed more Play Doh colours . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah and more Play Doh , 'cause that was all the red we had . Yeah . So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . Yeah , it c it might've been bigger . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh really ? Okay . <vocalsound> But ever everything else was satisfactory ? Is that good <disfmarker> Yeah . The computer programmes are good . Yeah . The <disfmarker> Yeah . It could be really straightforward for the computer . Yeah . I don't think there was anything <disfmarker> I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah ? Mm . <vocalsound> They'll probably still be there . Uh me too . Yeah . New ideas found . I don't really know what that means . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , like the n um <disfmarker> Yeah . Through discussion . yeah . Just about each different <gap> . Got new ideas from each other . <vocalsound> I'm not sure , new ideas found . Hmm ? Yeah well I guess we really <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> we bounced off of each other , which was cool . Yeah . Yeah . Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah , worked well . Yeah . And we were a able to modify each other's ideas Mm-hmm . Yeah . to fit in with our areas of expertise . <vocalsound> Yeah . Each other's <gap> Oh does it have smart materials by the way ? Sorry ? Does it have smart materials ? Mm . Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Well mm , did it come into the into <disfmarker> If if it if it <disfmarker> I dunno if we counted that in the costs . <vocalsound> If it can be afforded . <vocalsound> Okay ? Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide . <vocalsound> Yes our costs are within budget . Yes . It's evaluated generally positively . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then we celebrate Uh . <vocalsound> By watching T_V_ ? <vocalsound> Yay . Fantastic . in such a way that I have no idea . <vocalsound> Okay , brilliant . Alright ? Yeah . Thank you very much . <vocalsound> Okay , bye . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . Conclusion ? Dadada .
<gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> How do you wear this thing ? Hmm . Mm mm mm . <vocalsound> Not too many cables and stuff . <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Original . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is recorded ? Okay ? Okay so welcome everyone . So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . So I will first start with a warm welcome opening <vocalsound> stuff , <vocalsound> then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be <disfmarker> you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So <disfmarker> Uh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , <vocalsound> so maybe you could hurry up a bit <disfmarker> <vocalsound> sorry ? It's true . I have another meeting so if you could uh <disfmarker> You have another meeting soon ? Yeah . <vocalsound> So you have to be quick . Yeah , for the lawnmower project . Okay . Okay . So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . <vocalsound> So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . <vocalsound> And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing <vocalsound> and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . <vocalsound> What an original idea . <vocalsound> Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? <vocalsound> Orangutan . Okay <vocalsound> that's good . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No no n <vocalsound> n n <gap> Can I give you the You should <disfmarker> <disfmarker> no ? But I don't have to say anything . When I'm drawing the orangutan . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh <vocalsound> I'll let you uh comment . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . Okay it's an abstract drawing . Yes . I think it's nice and original . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You should write y the name I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't have a red colour . Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen , so <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Yes . You want to draw something Christine ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay uh sorry . You have to imagine a little bit <vocalsound> um . <vocalsound> This <disfmarker> Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sorry too <vocalsound> uh . Yes . I know . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is this uh <disfmarker> Wha what is this strange beast ? Is it beautiful ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is it a monster ? <vocalsound> Do you know ? It's a cat . <vocalsound> It's a cat ? <vocalsound> Isn't it ? <vocalsound> I thought these things did not exist . <vocalsound> Yes yes <vocalsound> Me <vocalsound> is it <disfmarker> like that . Is it better ? Ah yeah . Yeah . Ah yeah <vocalsound> Ah okay it's pretty . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> It's my cat . <vocalsound> Okay it's your cat . <vocalsound> Does have a name ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The name is Caramel . Caramel . Ah-ha . Caramel . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Olivier , do you want to <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And you <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think I'm too short for the cables . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure . Next time I concentrate . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm a bit short on cable . <vocalsound> Okay . So what could I draw ? <vocalsound> Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . <vocalsound> I don't know if it looks like a cow <vocalsound> <vocalsound> He looks like a bong . <vocalsound> Like a what ? <vocalsound> Okay . Sorry . No . Quite squarey . Scary ? <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> He also . <vocalsound> I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact <vocalsound> I would say . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I think we will be finished this uh <disfmarker> Mm . Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control . Is it for uh for putting a <disfmarker> for logos , no . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> Let's move on . So <disfmarker> Here the uh financial objective of our project . That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros . I is there a matter for a new remote control ? <vocalsound> Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? We have to discuss that point . Ah this is not defined at all ? On <disfmarker> yeah you you can suggest points like this . Ah , okay . So what what <disfmarker> so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . <vocalsound> So what's <disfmarker> what are your ideas about that ? Maybe I can have the <disfmarker> your opinion from the marketing side ? Well uh do we sell other stuff ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . Yeah . <vocalsound> Do you agree ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . So maybe it should be for multiple devices . And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ? <vocalsound> I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . I think <disfmarker> No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Few buttons . Okay . <vocalsound> And do you have it also to be <disfmarker> to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? Might be a good idea . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend <disfmarker> the trend in domain , what it shouldn't <disfmarker> it should look like , or things like that ? <vocalsound> Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box . Mm . With rou okay . Like for <disfmarker> okay . Something like that , least fits in your hand . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . The basic requirement . So . Fit in your hand , yeah . <vocalsound> Only a buck . And also it have , i it may be <vocalsound> it may be important for the remote control to be uh <disfmarker> To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Waterproof . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Water-proof as well . <vocalsound> And I think we should have a device <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh <disfmarker> in your bath whereas the others can't . Maybe water-proof would be very original . <vocalsound> Sorry . <gap> Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath . Mm . That could be uh <disfmarker> B it seems uh so , but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very <disfmarker> And , and that's one of the <disfmarker> that's one of the shock <disfmarker> I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . Yeah , mayb B That's people <gap> they actually do it themselves . But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . Yeah . <gap> directly . I it will look a bulky in that case . Yeah . Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . That might be good uh track to follow . Like as an optional thing . Optional or selled with it ? <vocalsound> And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control . We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . Yeah . Maybe we can have uh <disfmarker> But we don't design the T_V_ . <vocalsound> Ah yeah . Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Barks . <vocalsound> Barks . Yeah , barks , yeah . So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ? Yeah . Yeah whistle . I don't know , whistle-able ? <vocalsound> Whistle tracking . <vocalsound> Th <vocalsound> Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . <vocalsound> That's that's quite cool , but uh of course we <disfmarker> you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? Yeah d d uh . So i it's just going to add t to the cost . Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to <vocalsound> have an advantage over our competitors . I think this is a good advantage . <vocalsound> It's cool . I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you , who is giving <disfmarker> who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to ask <disfmarker> Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> yeah <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Which is you . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so try to find that for next meeting . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh . <vocalsound> Don't pani . <vocalsound> Don't panic . <vocalsound> So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working <disfmarker> any working function we have discussed . Mm-hmm . So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . Mm-hmm . And also um <vocalsound> I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . So . And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . <vocalsound> Mm . So . Thank you I think that's all for this point . Good . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Thank you <vocalsound> Uh , so we come back in five minutes ? Half an hour . Anyway you will receive some messages . <vocalsound> Be careful . You eat it ? Does it move uh ? Okay , but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh <disfmarker> We'll see . Ah . <gap>
Okay . Hi Team . <gap> Hope you had a good lunch . <vocalsound> Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . Um let's get started . 'Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . We're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . And we have forty minutes again . 'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . Okay . Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . Who would like to go first ? Just trying to move mine right now . Okay . Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ? Yeah <gap> . Okay . Trend watching ? Yeah . 'Kay . Okay , so trend watching . Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . So what they want . Right now customers want fancy versus functional . Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they <disfmarker> like of the product that they want , describing like the <disfmarker> in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . So the customer basically is confused . They don't know exactly what they want . They want us to tell them . <gap> They want everything , but simply . Yes . Exactly . <vocalsound> Okay . So we can go to next . Mm 'kay . Okay . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to Mm . Mm . rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . I mean do you guys know what I mean . <vocalsound> Yeah th Right . Yes . Yeah . Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , Right . <vocalsound> I I can <disfmarker> Right . because <disfmarker> People don't buy a new remote every so often . Yeah . I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now . I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation . Okay . Awesome . Okay . Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product . <gap> And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . Actually right here . So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . So it's classically retro . Hmm . So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . Very good . I like it . <vocalsound> Okay , ready for the next slide ? <vocalsound> And , yep . And that's it . <vocalsound> Op mm 'kay . <vocalsound> Okay . Great . Great presentation . Ready ? Okay hang on . 'Kay . See if it's there . <vocalsound> Which one is it ? <vocalsound> I don't know . Hang on . <gap> Interface concepts , no ? Interface concepts new . Either refresh it , or it sh <disfmarker> Oh wait , Y maybe I didn't put it there . Hang on . 'Kay . Mine will always read copy of something or other . Sorry ? <vocalsound> I I copied mine before I sent it over . Oh okay . Sorry , hang on . Don't know <gap> . Oh there we go . Okay . Okay , um <vocalsound> <gap> looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . Uh if you wanna start the next slide . Sure . Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . And then also there's the idea of the base . That's sort of like an idea there . And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . It's becoming really <gap> and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both <gap> kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like <vocalsound> using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but <disfmarker> Anyway , next . Mm 'kay . Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . Mm . And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . Um but then you have <disfmarker> you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way . Mm . Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . Okay . Okay . Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . Um this is particularly geared towards children . That's cute . Um it's very cute , <gap> and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain <disfmarker> <vocalsound> channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that , <vocalsound> uh keep them away from other channels . So that's like another ar Um , Okay . I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . You have the wider section for the main controls there . Uh you could see how many buttons there are . And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ <vocalsound> function which we are not gonna be using . Um . So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction . 'Kay . And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way . <vocalsound> Yeah . Hmm . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this . Mm . Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . <vocalsound> Right . I have four of those remotes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good lord . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Ready ? That's it . Oh , yeah . Okay . Great job . Okay , my turn . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Whoo . What's the title ? It'll be copy of component design . Got it . Yeah . Th that looks like it . 'Kay . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . So that being said <disfmarker> Next slide , please . Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . Next slide , please . Thank you . Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . <vocalsound> Next slide , please . Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . So next slide , please . Hmm . Interesting . Suggested casing options . Okay . We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters <disfmarker> <gap> That would be amazing , though , yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> No , splinters would <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um certain restrictions do apply here though . Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . Double-curved , you can't do titanium . What is that ? Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you <disfmarker> the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . Mm . Mm . Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . And uh so you <gap> functions what <disfmarker> for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . Right . I think I have one more slide . 'Kay . No , I didn't . No , okay . Um the manufacturing division also has said that um <vocalsound> they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . Mm . Right . Okay . Hmm . And that's all I got . Okay . Alright , well thank you for those informative presentations . Let's go back to um <disfmarker> Now we have to make some decisions . Where were we ? Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , Sure . and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . Um . Oh this <disfmarker> the thing we were talking about earlier . Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for <disfmarker> So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , <vocalsound> but I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme <disfmarker> do we program the responses and the questions . So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , Mm . or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . Right . Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . Right . So that way the remote reads it . Right , so it's got like a limited memory and <gap> programme it . So it's sort of iffy , but that's kind of what you'd say . Mm . I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really <disfmarker> Hmm . Programme . I mean we could do it , but <disfmarker> If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology <disfmarker> Technology . <vocalsound> Well , we are making the chip . Hmm . So , I mean <disfmarker> But , I guess , we have to look at w what <vocalsound> our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like Yeah . Mm . the , I mean just like the more advanced it is , Yeah . the better it'll sell . I I thought <vocalsound> offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know <disfmarker> I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . Hmm . So that we could reduce cost . Yeah , 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy . <gap> Yeah . Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um . Okay . Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? Oh the base , yeah . The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? I think the p I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before <disfmarker> 'Cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , Hmm . that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up <disfmarker> Yeah , W and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . It's not gonna be a huge universal remote . We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want Right . What size battery and <disfmarker> and exactly <disfmarker> Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , It could be like this . Yes . I'd , well uh <disfmarker> 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever , Are you gonna lose it easier ? because <disfmarker> But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that . That's true . So we can make it small if we have a l locating device . If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Hmm . So i That's the other thing , it's like <disfmarker> You know <gap> Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size <vocalsound> period ? Two double A_s , for this size . But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be <disfmarker> have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . Right . Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact <disfmarker> Right . I agree , Yeah . it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just <disfmarker> So we sh Smaller , without <disfmarker> Yeah . A battery like this guy . Yeah . Mm yeah . Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? You wanna vote ? I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced . I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of Yeah . I'm a away from the base . bigger and the base . Yeah . Yeah . 'Kay so <disfmarker> That just seems so clunky and <disfmarker> Yeah , because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , Smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> yeah <disfmarker> Okay . The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> You're kidding . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You know it happens . Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . I've had three watches go that way too . <vocalsound> Oh watches I've <disfmarker> but I've never washed a cell phone . <vocalsound> Ouch . A phone , whoa , that would <disfmarker> wow , that would hurt . Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? Pieces everywhere . Well , we have lots of options . I don't think wood is a viable option . Yeah wood . No . Well , titanium s Oh what did you <disfmarker> Oh sorry , go ahead . I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then I would probably <vocalsound> lean away from that . Yeah , 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive . Right . However , What would you recommend ? well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro Yeah . right ? Yeah . 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , That'll <disfmarker> Yeah , exactly . Mm . make them a rarity so to speak . The selling point , yeah . We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if <disfmarker> Are we restricted by this ? Yeah . Well the original <disfmarker> I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm Twenty five Euros Okay . not sure that we'll have the time and money to <vocalsound> produce a whole array of <gap> remotes . If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think . Yeah . Good plan . Good plan . Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ? Honestly I'd recommend like um <disfmarker> Hmm . uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , <gap> because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , Oh . Mm-hmm . Mm . because this year is all fruit , <vocalsound> God only knows why , Yeah , who knows . um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know <disfmarker> Okay . So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? O or we could like take off this . They could buy cases , maybe , They could come back . And buy the extra case . Okay . if they wanted . I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could <vocalsound> give two latex covers to start . Yeah . The <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . what the top face , right ? Okay . Okay . Yeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . That's in . Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic . Right . Right . Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? How complicated <disfmarker> Are we gonna go with the voice activated <disfmarker> Yeah . I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . A tracker , yeah . <gap> could we <disfmarker> Yeah . 'Cause that uh <disfmarker> what it type of , yeah , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , Hmm . because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . Right . So uh <disfmarker> Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing . Ooh . <vocalsound> Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's <disfmarker> it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech . Well , my little sister got <disfmarker> for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . Yeah , see that would just irritate me . And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . Oh dear . Oh , So it became highly irritating . then maybe voice Okay . maybe voice activation won't be good . So I think having a key-phrase is much better . Okay . Alright . But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ? Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder . But then it <disfmarker> Just a <disfmarker> No . Okay , alright . Hmm . Okay . But do <disfmarker> can your <disfmarker> can the department make <disfmarker> That would be like a mid-class um <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh , brilliant then . So we don't actually have to go for <disfmarker> Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . Why not introduce it in this way ? No . Yeah , good point . Mm 'kay . Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ? I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter . Two ? Could it run off of two <disfmarker> I mean more more come in a package . Well , that depends on what the energy is needed . Yeah . I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? So they're more widely available now . And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . They're more expensive though , too . But if you only have to replace it every five years . Mm . That's a good point . Thoughts anybody ? As long as we sell it with it . Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , 'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . Right , that's what I meant . We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . Okay . Yeah . Alright . Yeah . We still have one more meeting . Okay . So we've covered that first category , User Interface Concept , meaning design . What's it gonna <disfmarker> Yeah , what's it gonna look like . Okay . Um . I ki I kind of <vocalsound> like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that <disfmarker> the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? It might be the four way scroll , too . Yeah , it could be whatever , I mean if <disfmarker> Yeah . as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , Mm . Oh , that's true . because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? Good point . In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , Yeah . Yeah . which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , Oh , I see what you mean . that could be particularly useful . I think so . So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? Yeah , I like that . 'Kay . But we definitely <disfmarker> If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . Mm . Yeah , like on the side of it . Well , if it's just up and down <disfmarker> Oh if it's just up and down . But is that for <disfmarker> <gap> Volume or channel . Which ? <vocalsound> I don't know . Well , you could do some on both sides . Do we have both sides ? Can we ? Mm yeah . We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , Yeah . So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan 'cause oth <vocalsound> otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . That's squishy . That's squishy . Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . <gap> have buttons . Mm . Okay . Yeah . Yeah , <gap> that . Hmm . 'Kay any other ideas ? Um what colour ? Oh , yeah . Latex covers . W <vocalsound> We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . Yeah . And that's at the bottom of it . I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , Which button ? I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some <disfmarker> the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? Every cover ? Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . Yeah . So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . If we want it to be visible and <disfmarker> Um are all those <disfmarker> those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? Yeah . But those are plastic , right ? Yeah . They're not titanium . I kind of like that look . Uh but , or if it was really <disfmarker> For our base one ? <vocalsound> Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool . Yeah , What are your thoughts ? or like a gun-metal grey , Gun-metal gray . 'cause then it combines the silver and the black . There you go , gun-metal gray . <vocalsound> I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . Why ? It'll wear off . <vocalsound> What's the button <disfmarker> Yeah , buttons wear off . Well , w w then what's the button do , Mm . and how do you know that that is what the button does ? I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing . Right . Hmm . There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But we want it to be seen . On the back ? But you don't <disfmarker> It d visible <disfmarker> But uh , yeah , you don't see it . We need it to be seen . Visibility though <disfmarker> 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . Well , hang on . The other option is <vocalsound> , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if <disfmarker> I can find it again . Yeah , it's like the second to last slide . Okay . And yours was called Interface Concept ? Interface , yeah . This one ? Yeah . Um . Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly . <vocalsound> Okay , it's the very right one . You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . Mm And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . Okay , yes If c you envisioning it ? And so that stays the same when you have the logo , yes . and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes . Okay . The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so <gap> it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , Hmm . so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Like a little cut-out kind of <disfmarker> Yeah . Right . That's like , you know , <gap> a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened . Okay . Right . And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ? Yeah . Some of tho Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . Mm . Well , kind of . Mm . Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . Yellow . Yellow , I like that idea . Yeah . Like if we <vocalsound> like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . Mm . Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . Mm . So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . Oh , that one . I like the yellow illumination idea , very good . Yeah . Okay . Any other ideas or thoughts ? We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so <disfmarker> Um . Ha hang on <gap> <vocalsound> Let me catch up . Mm yeah . 'Kay . Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we <gap> just everything that we said before ? I think there will be time for that later . I'm guessing . 'Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put <disfmarker> We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , right ? Yeah . <vocalsound> I guess . 'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . Great . Play Doh . <vocalsound> Yeah . Fun . <vocalsound> Okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . Alright . Well , thank you for a very productive meeting . Wonderful Ooh .
Right uh . So um . So where's the PowerPoint presentation ? Sorry ? Microsoft PowerPoint , right . Right , okay . So . Right . Okay , so we've got uh so we've got new project requirements . Um . So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to uh <disfmarker> for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . Um . Three presentations . We have a <disfmarker> I guess we have a presentation each , 'cause I've got one . Um . Yeah . Yeah , I've got one too . I see , right . That's nice to know , one from each of you . Um new project requirements . Um so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to um <disfmarker> W I I got um <gap> or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . We discussed that last time Mm-hmm . and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . Mm-hmm . So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled <vocalsound> in a sense . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <gap> Um we've got uh teletext outdated . Um did you get any information on that ? Uh we didn't , no . No . Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . I d I didn't personally . Hmm . So I I got that in email form . <vocalsound> Um . Right okay . So I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . So we'll start with yourself Okay that's fine . on the basis that uh <disfmarker> I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one . Sorry , yep . <gap> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> What is it ? I'm not quite sure how it <disfmarker> I think you've got to do um control F_ eight . Control <gap> <disfmarker> Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . Shift F_ eight . <vocalsound> <gap> Alt function F_ eight . <vocalsound> Again not doing anything . <vocalsound> There's usually a little thing in the top right for the <disfmarker> Oh hang on , Oh . Ah there , it's just coming on . it's doing something . <gap> pressed about five times now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , that's me <gap> . Okay , um I have to go <gap> again . <gap> it going ? Hopefully that should be it this time . Okay , I think we're there . That's good . Okay , um <disfmarker> Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . Um <vocalsound> of the of the remote control . Um I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . Okay . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . And then the sender , which um is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television . <gap> . Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , so . I'll just go through there . S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? Oh I'll j I think it's that little <disfmarker> Uh there's the rubber on the right , I think . Oh I see . Oh okay . I'll get rid of the bear <gap> it's magic . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay that's great . Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no , a power supply which we'd probably get <disfmarker> it's probably gonna be the battery . Um we then have a particular button , which may be <disfmarker> <gap> that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . Um but this is how the basic system works . Um that sends <gap> after you press that that sends the message to the chip , which um then sends <disfmarker> It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . <vocalsound> Um . So that's <gap> . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . So this is the uh user interface . Um this is the chip itself , which then <gap> , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . And the sender sends a message to the receiver . 'Kay . So the the top bit's the power source , yes ? <gap> . Ah yes , that's the power source . Um . <gap> going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . <vocalsound> Um and then the sender , and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . You don't have to be point directly at the television itself . So the battery is the <disfmarker> in the sender . Um <disfmarker> Yes . 'Kay and that's it for the moment . Okay . Okay . So , now more design . <vocalsound> Right . Thank you . Mine's not quite as complicated as all that . <vocalsound> That's what we like to hear . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Did I press function ? Yeah . Is it control function Oh . ei Oh , th there you go . Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . <vocalsound> Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . Um here are two example remotes . Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . So , <vocalsound> it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . Um they're nice , kinda clearly labelled . Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . So it's very very user friendly , and it's got a little splash of colour . Could maybe do with some more colour . Um . Well there's a couple of things there . Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product . Hmm . Do we get to see that ? <vocalsound> I haven't as yet , no . Will you be presenting that in a bit ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . So uh I'm guessing that uh uh I notice on the bottom there it's got uh what's that ? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red . <gap> Hmm . Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . What do you mean by the circular section ? Possibly ? Like all of that bottom bit ? J yeah yeah yeah j yeah <vocalsound> just this little bit is that <disfmarker> I think that's still um a video remote part , Yeah . so maybe we could get rid of that as well . Yeah . And I don't really think that you need nine numbers . Well b uh w I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . Well th the on the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Like how often do you hit nine ? Mm-hmm . Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . It's just people are used to seeing that , But but <disfmarker> so if we didn't have them then they might think it's <disfmarker> <gap> But , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh I mean <vocalsound> how many channels do we have to um <disfmarker> actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? I would have thought that uh <gap> it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got <disfmarker> although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six <vocalsound> and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others . Mm-hmm . Hmm . So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather <disfmarker> Hmm . Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second <vocalsound> 'cause you have to be able to stop it . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . Mm-hmm . <gap> Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting <disfmarker> rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty <gap> Hmm . and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want Mm-hmm . and that would cut down your time . Mm . Um . Anyway . But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers <disfmarker> Okay , yeah . <vocalsound> Whatever . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Limit the number of buttons , user friendly . But I suppose nine's not really excessive . I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you <disfmarker> uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . I suppose it does make a good pattern . So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with <disfmarker> Yeah Well that's true , yeah , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , Yeah . Yeah . that that makes sense . 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . Yeah . Um . Mm-hmm . Does . Okay . So w so what was the circular thing that you were <disfmarker> Um I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all . So we could get it down to what ? If it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment . Mm-hmm . So we get to <disfmarker> How many buttons have we got ? We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . I guess . Mm-hmm . Um which isn't really too many . That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . Mm-hmm . Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market <vocalsound> was one of the considerations . 'Kay . I'm <disfmarker> I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , Mm-hmm . or was I meant to give you that information ? Um I'm not sure . I had I've had some market information , but not from the company , no . Right . Right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . 'Kay . We've only got about another four hours left . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so is everyone happy with that ? Ah yes yes , that seems good . Okay . Right well that's the end of my presentation . 'Kay . I'm gonna pull this off . <vocalsound> I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up . Yeah , I think she said twenty seconds to um <disfmarker> Uh-huh . Okay . I'm sure we'll have by the end of today . <vocalsound> I'll give it another go . Yeah , there we go . <vocalsound> <gap> Right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and um how do people use it ? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age <disfmarker> forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . <vocalsound> Okay , so <disfmarker> My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some <vocalsound> sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech <disfmarker> A design which looks high-tech , basically . Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . That's worth thinking about . Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . That that might be the market that we're we're looking for . And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to <vocalsound> speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . Mm . <vocalsound> Okay um , and that's the end of the slide show . That's it . Cool . Do <gap> a lot of um <disfmarker> What was that last wee bit there ? Um about speech recognition ? Speech recognition , <vocalsound> Yeah . But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't . Youn young people pref Yeah , they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . No what I maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition . Um . Yeah . Yeah . Well that's right . Yeah . And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have <disfmarker> You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can <disfmarker> <gap> some kind of buzzer system between the two . Yeah . So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . Uh-huh . Yeah . Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but <disfmarker> That is true , yes . Hmm . There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , Yeah . and then they whistle back , or something like that . Sounds reasonable . Yeah . That'd probably be really simple , they're cheap . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So <disfmarker> So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the <disfmarker> or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . But if you <disfmarker> I know . Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . <vocalsound> You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . <vocalsound> Yeah . But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then <disfmarker> <gap> you could have an option to turn it off . Or <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Perhaps , um . Yeah . So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . Mm . <vocalsound> So uh <vocalsound> Any sugges Well , any conclusions ? Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? <vocalsound> Mm . Considering <disfmarker> Well if it does then we can't . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's that simple , because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had <disfmarker> The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for <disfmarker> because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . Mm-hmm . And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . Okay . So that means that uh <disfmarker> 'Kay . so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project . Mm-hmm . So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . Yes . So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick Has to be simple enough to <disfmarker> because time to market is is critical . S <vocalsound> <gap> I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . Um . Mm-hmm . It would . But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . 'Kay . Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , Mm-hmm . which effectively now is sort of four hours . So <disfmarker> and if <disfmarker> and we've gotta get to the end . Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . So <disfmarker> <gap> Right okay , uh so I need to <disfmarker> Right . So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time . But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions About five minutes . and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . Yes . Mm-hmm . Um . <vocalsound> We'll also know w when the next meeting is I um <disfmarker> so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . <vocalsound> Does that make reasonable sense ? Mm-hmm . Yes that seems right . Yeah . Okay , yeah . So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Do it via the email Okay . Yep . so that rather than coming you know <disfmarker> If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . Okay . But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh <disfmarker> on what they come up with <vocalsound> effectively at the next meeting . Yeah . Okay . Mm-hmm . Right , is there <disfmarker> So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S I would guess so . Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . Mm-hmm . Yeah and <disfmarker> 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . Yep . <vocalsound> I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . Yeah . I don't really know about the voice recognition thing . I <vocalsound> w well uh i Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , Something simple . and if something comes back <disfmarker> Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . something that's quick and simple . Yeah . So , And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , sounds good . 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . On the basis that if we've got <disfmarker> if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , <gap> now something that doesn't like whis uh No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? <vocalsound> Well I I I don't know . Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , <vocalsound> but if <disfmarker> I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , No , clapping , I think clapping , I'd go more <disfmarker> Yeah , f more for clap . yeah . Yeah . so uh so clap option . Yeah . Okay . 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? Uh . Is that one of the <disfmarker> Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Taking out teletext , okay . so so take out teletext . Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers Right . and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . Yeah , I think so , so zero to nine . Mm . I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , Yeah . so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together . Okay , ten numbers <vocalsound> and then some kind of device to allow uh <disfmarker> Yeah . I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . Yeah . Or multiple digits . Yeah . Did we decide anything about um the other functions ? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? You had an had an idea about the menu ? Uh <vocalsound> we could possibly put an L_ <disfmarker> a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that <disfmarker> But just thinking um people probably <disfmarker> I mean you don't have <disfmarker> you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . Yeah . So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . You can't really avoid that . Mm-hmm . Hmm . No . Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves . Yeah . So that'll be in <disfmarker> But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic Yes . and if it is at the moment , that's fine . But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it <disfmarker> uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances Yeah . Yeah . Yeah yeah . and the idea is to have an international market Mm . which is <disfmarker> Yeah . And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech . Yeah . I s I suppose um if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote Possibly . 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , That's right . so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . <gap> Yeah . Yeah . So how would this menu function work ? Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . <vocalsound> Yeah , Yeah , that would be a good idea , yeah . like the volume or something . Okay . Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . My dad was watching a film the other week Mm-hmm . and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . <gap> <gap> we're gonna have the the individual numbers Hmm . and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide <disfmarker> Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu <gap> use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . Uh <disfmarker> I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one <disfmarker> the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . <vocalsound> Right , okay um . So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you're basically pressing <disfmarker> <gap> that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . Right . Okay . Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? Okay , well . Mm . Yeah . So y So you don't use it that much , Ah That's a very good idea . you don't have to see it all the time . But it's all there if you need it . That is that is a good idea actually . Yeah , yeah . Sor sort of a second . So you keep um <disfmarker> Like a hidden panel . Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . Okay . I don't know if you've got the same . Uh not quite , but I guess <gap> . Okay . So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . Keep the other buttons but hide them away . Hmm . And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , Ah . Mm-hmm . but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly . Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> Yeah . So um <vocalsound> we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess . Yeah . That's right . Yeah . <gap> data functions hidden at back . So th the <disfmarker> Can bring out when needed . The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , Yeah . uh sorta <disfmarker> That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . So sh We have to decide . Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . I guess so . So on the <disfmarker> So on front , <gap> about the number <gap> . numbers , Um the volume up and down . And the volume ? <vocalsound> volume . Shall we have a mute button as well ? Um . Sorry ? A mute button as well . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Yeah Or <disfmarker> I think they're handy . Mm-hmm . And probably a power one as well . <vocalsound> Dunno . I know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity <gap> . Have you seen the adverts ? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm-hmm . If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time . <vocalsound> Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . Yeah . Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . <vocalsound> Uh-oh danger sign . I think you probably should . Yeah , <vocalsound> but a little bit smaller . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Compromise . Well <vocalsound> <gap> . Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . Okay , so we'll have um <disfmarker> Right . So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? Um . Channel up and down . What else have we got ? What was that , sixteen ? Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , th Yeah si Volume button . How many volumes ? One up , one down . Right okay . On mute . And a mute , yeah . That's sixteen isn't it , yeah . Is there anything else ? Um . I don't think so , no . Power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . So is that it ? <gap> so . <gap> Okay . That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . And then at the back ? You've got brightness and contrast . Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . And then <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . So on the back it'll have brightness , contrast , Mm-hmm . anything else ? Uh there's audio functions . You're also gonna have the channel tuner <gap> , as it were . Yeah . So tuner up and down , I guess . Yeah . Tuner , would that have up and down ? <gap> . Um up <disfmarker> Tune one way , tune the o I think they normally do . <gap> okay <gap> . Okay . I I dunno I dunno possibly . Yeah . Yeah . And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . Oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select . Yeah , okay . Um I guess we're keeping s it simple . We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up , volume down . Um up volume , yeah , I would have thought so . Um . Yeah . So I think um there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . Yeah . Okay . Do they have their own <disfmarker> do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , Um maybe for the younger market . or do you have to do it via the remote ? Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . Yeah I suppose if we've got their <disfmarker> if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . Yeah . Yeah . Oh no , I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote . Oh , okay . Right . Mm-hmm . But I don't really know what they're for , I've never used them . Um . I just know they're something to do with Dolby . Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think <disfmarker> Well you might get some research . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well shall we look into that and just get back together . Okay . Okay . Right . Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting . Right . And we'll meet back at I'm not sure . Um forty minutes , I believe is the time . 'Kay . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Come on .
<vocalsound> That went well , thank you . <vocalsound> 'Kay . That's great . Perfect . Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it <disfmarker> 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . <vocalsound> And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . I'll go first . Go ahead . Alright Nathan , take it away . It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? No Nathan's fine . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good . It's either Nathan or participant two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mister participant two that is . <vocalsound> Uh . <vocalsound> Nice . Okay . Um , Nice . basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so <disfmarker> Mm . Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look <disfmarker> if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um <disfmarker> the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . Hmm . Mm . So we'll have to look into that . Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah . Okay , brilliant . Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . Hmm . Right . Um and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Nice . Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record <disfmarker> if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part <disfmarker> use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . Hmm . So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . Interesting . Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> M Maybe <disfmarker> Mm . Good call . is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like <disfmarker> Choose it . Yeah . I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course <disfmarker> Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea . Yeah , just as a fun gimmick . Yeah . Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? Interesting question . 'S a bit of a challenge question . Mm . Well Yes . I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? Mm . Right , that's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is <disfmarker> I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about <disfmarker> I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we're not so confined by one style and say some <disfmarker> you know , say our <disfmarker> the one <disfmarker> Right . if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . Mm . Right . Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind <disfmarker> before we launch <disfmarker> can we see how they're received ? Um <disfmarker> It's an option , uh but actually there's <disfmarker> I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now Okay . Okay . which actually might even come into play beforehand , Okay , it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway . perfect . Great , thank you very much Nathan . Oh yeah , you're welcome . That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . <vocalsound> I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Did you ? <vocalsound> You waiting for me ? <vocalsound> Fascinating , compelling even . I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . <vocalsound> Right . So current market trends . <vocalsound> Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now <disfmarker> basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting <disfmarker> they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um <disfmarker> that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , Mm . v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be <vocalsound> Tomatoes . <vocalsound> a different shape <vocalsound> or <vocalsound> okay , <vocalsound> not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of <disfmarker> and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> uh not something I I've come up with a <gap> <vocalsound> I like it , I like it . <vocalsound> though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something <disfmarker> Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use <disfmarker> we can use a rubber as part of the case , Mm-hmm . it has a consistency of those stress balls . Yes . Mm . <vocalsound> Might be an interesting way to go . Fabulous . Slick , slick . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new <disfmarker> I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Mm . <vocalsound> Um . Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . Yeah . I like the idea of of rubber too because it's <disfmarker> tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . Mm . True . 'Cause so many <disfmarker> you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls . Very true . Very true . Yeah , it's like , yep <vocalsound> Taped with duck tape and what have you , Very much so <vocalsound> . Um you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber . it's ubiquitous We can have a duck tape casing . isn't it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We could . I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It could go with the granola crowd . but worth a shot . <vocalsound> Ah , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it could be , it could be , <vocalsound> Great , um . Yeah that's what I know . thanks for that Sarah . No problem . Ron ? Phew . Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls <vocalsound> that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . Yeah Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um <disfmarker> with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team <vocalsound> On the remote control <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Very true , very true . at the <gap> <vocalsound> right . Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod Mm . which I am sure most of you know about . Mm . Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern <gap> a bit bulky , a bit crazy , Mm . Mm . I don't think that's we're necessarily going for . No . And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your <disfmarker> for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I <disfmarker> again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I can see . <vocalsound> Um , again probably not what we're going for <vocalsound> so I <disfmarker> I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing Okay . although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh <disfmarker> our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it Mm , right . and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already Mm . and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . Mm . And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank <vocalsound> has jokes when it's ready . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nice . Great . And uh that is about it . Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have . Mm . That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . <vocalsound> Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um <vocalsound> various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places . 'Kay . 'Kay . But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then Mm-hmm . right ? My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , <vocalsound> To produce each one . Per ? yeah that's just an estimate though . Piece . Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I know Mm . You industrial designers . <vocalsound> I know . <vocalsound> Hmm . It's fun . <vocalsound> And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? Well . Do we remember ? I thought there was some flexibility with that . Okay . There is , it's just , it is a question of <disfmarker> and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . Can we justify it ? Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin <vocalsound> um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . Right . So <disfmarker> Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? That's just off the top of my head , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it is pending further emails . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> From the board , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . um , well <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Though I think that's what people would pay for , <vocalsound> I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something <disfmarker> That's true , I mean <disfmarker> It is the new <disfmarker> it would be in a class of its own . Yeah . <vocalsound> And that's <disfmarker> to be fair the um the per cent of the market <disfmarker> we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make <disfmarker> I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , Right . so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Yeah . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , See if we can cut some corners . my my team in the uh <disfmarker> on the third floor suggested that uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . Mm . Yeah . It's true . We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on <disfmarker> Right . It's a starting point anyway , so . No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we <disfmarker> yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> our main selling point here . Mm . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , Yeah 'cause with voice recognition <disfmarker> I think that our casing and the voice recognition <disfmarker> I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . <vocalsound> The voice rec thing , Yeah . I mean , <vocalsound> if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , <vocalsound> I think we might have to drop the voice rec . I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . Yeah . To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , Price-wise . I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice <disfmarker> True . we're using it for our coffee machines already . We've already got it . I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh <disfmarker> guy down the hall . Sounds good . <vocalsound> Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? I think if we <disfmarker> we do both the <disfmarker> obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into <disfmarker> it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . Pretty much . It would be very nice . I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . Mm . Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . <vocalsound> Yeah . Does having both really up our costs ? <vocalsound> I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three . Yeah . Yeah , 'cause you <disfmarker> you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . It's just impossible . Yeah . Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just <disfmarker> it just becomes cost prohibitive . What <disfmarker> which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , 'Kay . we already have the <disfmarker> all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's <disfmarker> What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ? <vocalsound> Well my p <vocalsound> is <disfmarker> Nathan ? Mm . Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would <disfmarker> they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition Mm . we're not gonna have to do as much design work <vocalsound> Right . and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean . Right . Right . <vocalsound> Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment . And we're still not <disfmarker> then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , Mm . we can stick with what we've already got . In a lot other ways too . Okay . So I'm getting <disfmarker> alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay . I think it's our lower risk option which for right now <disfmarker> we can have it on the market sooner Yeah . which is all in all our best option . Okay . Sorted . <vocalsound> We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . It's you and me outside a little here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's <disfmarker> you guys's next step right ? Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it <disfmarker> what <vocalsound> f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype Yeah . Right . but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype . Okay . Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? Yes . Mm-hmm . We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . Okay . You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . Mm . Yeah . Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to <disfmarker> Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , Mm . Yep . like what if <disfmarker> wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably <disfmarker> It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , <vocalsound> Calculator . and you know how those those don't really require that much light , Yeah . True . True . um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Right . Okay . Okay . What do you think Ron ? I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . Okay . Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . Uh <disfmarker> Hmm . Hmm . Interesting . <vocalsound> Yeah . Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? Just a thought . What's the uh idea ? Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . Hmm . Do you think people that are <disfmarker> people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . right . But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have <disfmarker> or like um <vocalsound> who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass Mm-hmm . and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . Right . Yep . Yeah . I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well . With the bu yeah . And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out . I think , I think you're on to something Mm-hmm . because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Yeah . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is <disfmarker> would be good , even though <disfmarker> and hand-held the same time . True . Way to go . <vocalsound> I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal , Mm-hmm . you know like that little pod looking thing ? Mm . Yeah , Exactly . those are nice . Yeah , I mean a nice <disfmarker> although we do um wh uh is <disfmarker> I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing Right . Mm . and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um <disfmarker> That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . Mm . Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . Okay . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh <disfmarker> using like a rubber kind of softer feel , Mm . um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit <disfmarker> gives just a bit . Yeah . You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . Right . Just kind of the squishy feel . Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . <vocalsound> Mm 'kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it <disfmarker> literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . Right . <vocalsound> Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good . Handy . Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , <vocalsound> um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um . Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers Okay . and I'm just having to guess . <vocalsound> We'll have more of an idea when the prototype <disfmarker> have more of a <disfmarker> we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we <disfmarker> wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um <vocalsound> a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be <disfmarker> Right . Like maybe have menu things . Take precedence , If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out yeah . like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here Right . Mm . and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . And they slide . Yes . Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p <vocalsound> Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . True , <vocalsound> Yeah we're still not making it easier then . we've also got the the me the thing of , Yeah . if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we <disfmarker> yeah . True . Fair enough . B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it <disfmarker> say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . Yeah . Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um <disfmarker> like on a D_V_D_ player . You know Mm-hmm . you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them Yeah it's just a scroll . and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . Right . Yeah . So are we gonna <disfmarker> are we talking <disfmarker> we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um <disfmarker> Well it seems like <vocalsound> I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um <disfmarker> stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um <vocalsound> rubber for the outside case Yeah . we might as well stick with that um . Probably . Right . I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . Right . Mm . Well no it's basic just like four directions that are <disfmarker> that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for . Right . Mm 'kay , um . <vocalsound> We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling <vocalsound> um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um . Mm . <vocalsound> Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right , particularly in technological fields , so that's exactly where we're headed . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . Well what are we actually doing ? <vocalsound> Right . What were <disfmarker> I was just gonna step on to um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh . Oh it wasn't in the way but <disfmarker> yeah , whatever . I wasn't ? Oh , my bad <vocalsound> um sorry . No , don't worry about it . <vocalsound> The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next Sure . b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and Okay . <disfmarker> cool ? <vocalsound> Yeah . So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? Or are we just going to go with one ? <vocalsound> Um . ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases Yeah . and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well <disfmarker> mm . Yeah . Right . It's a tough situation , but obviously having more cases also costs more so <disfmarker> Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something . There's an idea . Mm . Yeah . That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the <gap> thing . And again copying iMac's kind of <disfmarker> for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme . Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally . Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on <vocalsound> uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda <disfmarker> yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh <disfmarker> I'd like <disfmarker> Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . <vocalsound> Right . And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> using um <vocalsound> prototype building materials um <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . Oh excellent yeah . So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , Cool . you guys feel clear about this ? That sounds good . Fabulous . Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys . Cool .
Okay , all set ? Welcome to the conceptual design meeting . Uh , okay . Yes . The agenda . The opening . I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . So um , <vocalsound> who wants to start off ? Technical uh designer again ? <vocalsound> Again . Okay . Hmm . Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . So <disfmarker> But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just <vocalsound> ordinary keyboard . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , may be better , yeah . Keyboard work . Yeah . I think it <gap> will will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes . Yeah . Alright . Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the <disfmarker> and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of . Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of <disfmarker> in uh in buying uh the remote controls . Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh <disfmarker> yeah , it feels uh good in your hand . <vocalsound> Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction . Um uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . Mm <disfmarker> It's okay . Yeah . I when we use a rubbled <disfmarker> a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to <disfmarker> uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh <disfmarker> Um Oh . the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um , uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um <disfmarker> Uh here you have to have a hand uh <disfmarker> yeah , kinetic uh energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and <disfmarker> so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . That's true , I guess . Yeah . <gap> . Well , maybe a little bit expensive . <vocalsound> I don't know . Huh . Uh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium . Um the chip <disfmarker> uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory . Mm , I've told about uh the three first points . Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company . Um , another possibility . I uh yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros . Twelve and a half . Ah yeah . Actually <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , production cost . <vocalsound> I th I got an email with uh some examples and it <disfmarker> these were were the most trendiest one . <vocalsound> You see uh a covers , which can be <disfmarker> What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so <vocalsound> Um , I don't know . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But it's actually kind of uh <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj Yes . Yep . You know the the cartoonish <vocalsound> Alessi kind of design . Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh <disfmarker> And we can we can steal their ideas . <vocalsound> maybe a kind of uh whole uh um a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh Huh . with a <gap> huge variety of uh Well , it's a possibility , too . uh house uh stuff . Different colours also . Like uh <vocalsound> maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this <disfmarker> in the same style , but <disfmarker> Uh-uh . <vocalsound> Yeah , that'll be for the future , I guess . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yes , because we have to uh <disfmarker> we have to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it . <vocalsound> Next time we're here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh , okay . Yeah . Definitely . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Thank you . <vocalsound> Alright . <gap> uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . That's okay . Ah . <vocalsound> Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um <vocalsound> um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . <vocalsound> I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh <disfmarker> Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . Didn't we ? Oh , okay . I ha I ha I have the I have <disfmarker> Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Just <disfmarker> nothing . no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only . Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . Okay . I dunno if they're <disfmarker> maybe a little bit more , but <disfmarker> Well we <disfmarker> maybe we can think of that later . Yeah . W just <disfmarker> these are the ones you already summed up in the <disfmarker> Yeah , I I uh <vocalsound> well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . Okay . Um Another function uh is <disfmarker> of course we already discuss it on the side . Um , I don't know what costs of it . Uh , I've no idea about it . Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for <disfmarker> I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production . Yeah . Uh-huh . If we got already uh something like a base . That might get redundant also maybe . I don't know what kind of information it would <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't know . I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But <disfmarker> Mm yeah . Yeah . Yeah , it's okay . Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t <vocalsound> to the remote control . <vocalsound> The remote control . <vocalsound> Then you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> a little uh too <disfmarker> <vocalsound> A little bit <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and then you've got a flag s <vocalsound> Very big R_C_ . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> That's not <disfmarker> A little bit too big , I think . <vocalsound> It was not a good idea . Exactly . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . No . No . It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the <disfmarker> no V_C_R_ or that kind of <disfmarker> No . uh , so that's very easy . Um <disfmarker> But you do mention the next and previous uh button . Mm-hmm . <gap> Next channel , previous channel . Well , that's next channel . I mean <gap> next channel . Oh , okay , o okay okay . Uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> oh , I I got an email with <disfmarker> <vocalsound> with an uh a remote control with a base . Huh . So , it's uh just an idea . And I um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But you're the expert . <vocalsound> I think it depends on the function . Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness . Mm-hmm . Maybe it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , if you save uh <disfmarker> Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course . <vocalsound> Well uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> okay , that's your point . Um , yeah . Yeah , okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , I've nothing to <vocalsound> s <vocalsound> Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . Oh , that's right . Uh , with a little bit larger , yeah . Yeah . I thought so , but maybe with the <disfmarker> Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have <disfmarker> yeah , they have to be large . Yeah , that groups . Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the <disfmarker> to skip channels and to uh <disfmarker> Large ? Yeah . Yep . I think <disfmarker> yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is <disfmarker> that's t trendy too , Most <disfmarker> the most used uh buttons . Those are probably the the th because that's the mo it <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ? It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t Yes . True . Yeah . Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control . Yeah . You did the research . And you want to acc accentuate that , you know . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's from your research . <vocalsound> Sorry ? Yeah , sure . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Uh , that was all y uh personal preference I didn't have . I didn't had any time left . Okay . No uh , that's coo it's cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You don't care . No , <vocalsound> sorry . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh . Go away . Come on . It's there . Yeah , click on it . <gap> . Couple time . Oh , great . Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet . Um I've done some investigation , and uh well I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan . <vocalsound> Some uh some findings <disfmarker> the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . Uh , our market really likes really likes that . And uh the third point there in this uh order if <disfmarker> of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . <vocalsound> So we probably won't do that . The younger market likes uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , <gap> the <gap> themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I found this image , which is uh <disfmarker> Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . I don't see the spongy part in it . But with a little bit of fancy <disfmarker> Well maybe c <vocalsound> then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Exactly . I got some ideas <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh well , yeah , pictures isn't really good word , but um <vocalsound> some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . Uh , catchy colours . <vocalsound> Fruit is uh yellow , green , red , whatever . <vocalsound> So , remote controls in in catchy colours . It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours . Uh , no , we don't want dark colours . <vocalsound> Not the dark colours ? Okay . <vocalsound> No , I just put them there to uh , yeah , uh for general idea . Okay . And uh , the docking st <vocalsound> uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . But to <disfmarker> Yeah , the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh uh v how do you say ? For diversity or something . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want <vocalsound> maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . Well , how uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes . But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's <vocalsound> sake with <vocalsound> remote control ? <vocalsound> No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . Yeah , there's there's always a Uh , make it a banana ? <vocalsound> It's like a pear or something . Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well <vocalsound> the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons , I guess . No , I don't think you have to do it like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you you can put some fruity things <disfmarker> Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . <vocalsound> No , of course not . And so y I I think this <disfmarker> y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something . Especially i Yeah , but th <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Yeah , exactly . yeah , but that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but that's <disfmarker> If we make it little bit greenish . Yeah . You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round <disfmarker> Yeah uh uh <disfmarker> A <vocalsound> and we could use <vocalsound> one of these for 'Kay . the uh w what is it ? Yeah , uh <disfmarker> yeah , I don't know . Grapes . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Isn't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , this is a b yeah . <vocalsound> Wha whatever . But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ? <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Of course we have uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , sure . Yeah . we have a very big uh the s Well , w we can uh <disfmarker> w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . For a big team of artists . <vocalsound> Of d design team , yeah . <vocalsound> This is then the uh pear . I don't know the English word , so forget it . <vocalsound> Yeah , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's pear , I guess . <vocalsound> And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n <vocalsound> not easy for a remote control , but m yeah . But uh but I think we don't have to make <vocalsound> we can't make all uh ten designs . No . We have to make one design I th I I think . No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . Mayb maybe two or three . Yeah . Uh , it's <disfmarker> it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . Yeah . <gap> No sure , but but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> B but that's great , And it's <disfmarker> it looks fruity to me . and and and what I was <disfmarker> what what I was saying , the catchy colours <disfmarker> And uh , but I do like the <disfmarker> yeah , I do like uh the f uh to <disfmarker> the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do <disfmarker> I think a dark colour would be nice too . Yeah . But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables <disfmarker> Maybe it's too much , you know . But , we we have to um <disfmarker> There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . Yeah , uh not really . Pictures was a was a bad word , but <disfmarker> Okay , but what are the <disfmarker> This is yellow . Well we c yeah . Yellow , a Real Reaction . Yes , you can put a logo on top of it . Yeah , sure . But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable . Uh , yeah . Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . <vocalsound> We uh f Yes , it's really fruity . <vocalsound> I can't draw with this thing , but I'll try . A yellow do If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . Uh , yeah . It doesn't work . And then <disfmarker> Yeah , and the button then . With a strawberry on top . Yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do <disfmarker> Well , the button button over here or whatever , I don't know . Okay , yeah . On the front , of course , because else you can't find it . Okay . Well , that were my ideas a little bit . I'll close 'em down . Okay . Um , go away . Okay , you <disfmarker> can you open the conceptual design presentation ? Conceptual design , yes . See what was on the agenda . <vocalsound> Lazy . <vocalsound> The agenda . This is his own remote . Because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , Yeah . but I don't think it's there <disfmarker> uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . Only if we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Me neither . Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . I mean <disfmarker> Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's so <disfmarker> No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the <disfmarker> with uh with <vocalsound> uh four programmes . I don't think we should do it . You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button . Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because <disfmarker> Yes , it can <disfmarker> On your <disfmarker> No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . So why not on your remote ? Yeah , but <disfmarker> no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . Yeah , I don't know . And it's also not <disfmarker> I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , Well well what would you display on it then ? it's <disfmarker> Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide Programme information . But is it <disfmarker> isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ? But <disfmarker> on t on teletext , yes . Also on the internet . Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . Yeah . Yes , but you also want to know what's next . But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , Yeah , and we also have to <disfmarker> yeah . but whatever . <vocalsound> Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible . Yes , that's uh really possible . <vocalsound> Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And I also <disfmarker> I really understand you want to make your job more exciting <vocalsound> by putting an L_C_D_ in it , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with <disfmarker> we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials , uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . Yeah . But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know . That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's uh frag fragile . Yeah , yeah . You could make it , but it's just <disfmarker> it it doesn't <disfmarker> I don't think it <disfmarker> it's coherent with the design we're after . No . No . I don't think so ei either . But that's my opinion . Well , you you y Okay , we can vote for it . <vocalsound> You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and <vocalsound> he doesn't , so it's up to him . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . Ah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If we wanna <disfmarker> Yeah , I dunno . <vocalsound> And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights . <vocalsound> . Oh , okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bastard . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I can also say <disfmarker> We can <gap> you away . But did we skip the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , you could do <disfmarker> m but what what i so what i but do you think we should <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , I don't know . Uh , uh I <disfmarker> i if it's it's a simple p We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So <disfmarker> No , that that's right , No uh um <disfmarker> and uh I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . Kind of L_C_D_ or something or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions . Yeah , I guess . But how does it display then ? W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ? Uh , then you push a button . The title and the information about the programme . About that programme ? But but uh <disfmarker> yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the <disfmarker> Nah , that's not gonna work . But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first No . Yeah . you have the biggest uh <disfmarker> Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , Yeah . but then it's very functional to indicate which <disfmarker> what uh uh device you are controlling . So it's <disfmarker> that that's what I've seen . Yeah , that's true , Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . if you uh <disfmarker> Yeah . But it just <disfmarker> it j it doesn't doesn't match with the <gap> our whole basic concept . But uh I haven't thought about it . But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh uh screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . Well yeah , yeah , okay . That's maybe not the most important , You can throw with it and <disfmarker> but it's just <disfmarker> Is it fashion ? When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from <disfmarker> I don't think so . <vocalsound> I don't know . That's not up to you . That's up to market if i if it's trendy . Yeah , well do you ha do you have to <disfmarker> <gap> You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ? <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Because our our motto is we put fashion <disfmarker> Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if <disfmarker> well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think <disfmarker> Uh , I think it will be too expensive . But uh I've got a <disfmarker> the email with uh with the possibilities . <vocalsound> And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . So why don't we use it . Uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ? Yeah , but we're gonna <disfmarker> if it <disfmarker> Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . Coloured <disfmarker> Yeah really , if y if you c i If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's <disfmarker> I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . Then uh then you better don't <disfmarker> yeah , d <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Really . <vocalsound> No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or <disfmarker> But , mm , I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . I didn't think that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> I'm sorry . It can't co you cannot convince me . I don't know how <disfmarker> well how to <disfmarker> with you guys , but <disfmarker> I don't really feel it . We already <disfmarker> we're uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and <disfmarker> Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , Yeah . and want <disfmarker> and it <disfmarker> uh uh , do <disfmarker> it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft <disfmarker> Yes , but o on the <disfmarker> W we've we've gotta find a balance , of course . With one thing special . And I think <disfmarker> Not a whole package of specialty . I don't think <disfmarker> I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . No , when y Y we want to <disfmarker> But it look <disfmarker> it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ . Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . The simple <disfmarker> It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote . Yes , but but when you want to have something special <disfmarker> Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . We have a pear . And uh the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> It has to be developed , <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> no , but it <disfmarker> that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> that's our that's our killer feature . It's just an it's just an idea . <vocalsound> That's our <disfmarker> what makes it special . It's a it's <disfmarker> Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station . Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station . True . Is that so ? Was it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it wasn't just a prototype ? Yes , he have a picture of it . Well uh I uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I dunno . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Exactly , <vocalsound> I've never seen it in a store . <vocalsound> Uh , but re we really have to cut this off , I re I know you <disfmarker> I I I I <vocalsound> I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . I don't <disfmarker> uh , do you guys agre How do you guys think ? I d No , it's too much . I think it's a little too much , yeah . It's overdone . Okay , we s skip the <vocalsound> L_C_D_ display . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> I'm sorry , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Democratically . maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . Mayb <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I will rule the world with it . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Probably so . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay . But for the technical part . The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is <disfmarker> Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands Yeah , for the spongy uh feel . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yes . With a spongy Bob feel . Yeah . and also to , know , like <disfmarker> Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . Like a b yes . You can st throw it at your little brother's head . <vocalsound> Yeah , airbag . Yeah , you just can drop it . Yeah . If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . No no no , not that comfy . <vocalsound> Maybe it <disfmarker> but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see . Yeah yeah . Yeah . Okay , that's a that's a good point . And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , Yeah . because it may be <disfmarker> the design uh , it's uh maybe it is a bit of the <disfmarker> But not black I think . it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point . No . Well if if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful . Yeah , that's that's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . Yeah , b yeah , that's what w I I was pointing at . But can we ge uh uh <disfmarker> It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , then when you put it on your <gap> just <disfmarker> Can we combine it or something ? Uh with uh yellow and black ? Yeah . Yeah , maybe so . Make it a bee ? What ? <vocalsound> A bee . <vocalsound> Oh , a bee . Oh . <vocalsound> No , uh I don't like the yellow and black combination <gap> . But it is our company colours . Apparently . <vocalsound> Yes , real real good colours . <vocalsound> Yeah , <gap> it's our <disfmarker> yeah . We we have to use yellow . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Hmm . Hmm . I don't like yellow , and uh maybe <disfmarker> I don't know . Well , we can as as I But that's not really fruity . draw really nicely over there . <vocalsound> We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . Uh , yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . But <disfmarker> But , i Okay , but what <disfmarker> uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? <vocalsound> Uh fronts <vocalsound> of the <disfmarker> We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the Should we do that ? telephone . I don't think you <disfmarker> we should do that . Maybe just bring it out in different colours , Different fronts . but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . Yeah . I guess that's that's enough . People don't wanna spend more money on their remote <vocalsound> control , I guess . That's way too Nokia . Yeah . Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . Are these designs ? Yeah , yeah . Yeah , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market . Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that . But uh , without <disfmarker> gon uh Why not , yeah . okay . So , are we through the technical part then ? Yes . Okay . So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but <disfmarker> Yeah . It <disfmarker> this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles . Well , yeah , the <disfmarker> Three to one . <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all <disfmarker> were quite okay . <gap> Yes . O o only only the last point your <disfmarker> And tita uh titanium , is <disfmarker> uh is is it a no ? Yes , <gap> <disfmarker> no titanium's not not out of question , I guess . Is <disfmarker> But also w It's just like that , th this titanium . Yes , b bu but when we use s soft But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? mm <disfmarker> Sure . Makes it in a homogeneous uh design . Mm . No , not all , not all of them . But it it <disfmarker> then it uh <disfmarker> you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff <vocalsound> when you throw with uh titanium <disfmarker> <vocalsound> with your remote control . <vocalsound> It will it will break other stuff w <vocalsound> when it's plastic , as well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No uh , <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder . Yeah , that's true . No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah . But also on the colours , the young <disfmarker> Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in <disfmarker> completely titanium . Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ? Yeah , I think it I think it does . Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the <disfmarker> In trendy things . Yeah , o On the other hand , if you want to make fruit <disfmarker> fruity stuff with uh <disfmarker> Yeah . It's cold in the winter . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . Yeah . But the question is i then it's , you know , is is <disfmarker> it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's true , that's true . Sports and gaming . Define When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . It's always fun to have something big and plastic around . Yes . Yeah . You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? Yes , it's w but it is uh plastic . Isn't it <disfmarker> Is plastic ? Well , it's titanium looking . Yes , w we can do that on the on the <disfmarker> What ? Yeah , he is . Here he is . Uh , the <disfmarker> I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . 'Kay , uh that that's very uh with rubber , so it's very Oh , yeah . Okay , yeah . <gap> Yeah , that's beautiful . Yeah , I see . We can make this as a style too . Yeah , but but but <disfmarker> rough . Uh , this is uh just a <disfmarker> Oh , maybe th maybe this is an <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , I th I think that's difficult , because uh that's different material , and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of <disfmarker> No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . Yeah , if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these . Uh <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind <disfmarker> type of body w and then with s plastic colouration <gap> around it . You know , like the the soft stuff , Yeah . but I don't know if it's possible . I don't have the information . Uh , I I didn't got it <disfmarker> But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . <vocalsound> True . Yes . But make it just like shiny . Mm-hmm . Yeah yeah , true . Maybe we should uh shou Like the M_P_ three player . Yeah , maybe that's good idea , yeah . But if you want to la uh yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe <disfmarker> Yeah . And uh and <vocalsound> maybe we sh should we t <gap> I don't know if we should talk about <disfmarker> uh , how how much time have we got left ? Uh , in a lot of other uh I don't know . What time does <disfmarker> Forty minutes . in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon <disfmarker> of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and <disfmarker> <gap> You putting in different colours . Yes , and and styles . Okay . They have uh also uh a kind of uh um uh roses on it , a and uh <disfmarker> Uh yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah , but w yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , it is . It's a possibility . But , let's think about the bas Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new <disfmarker> Yes . New prints on it . Yep . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . yes . But wha th our basic idea <disfmarker> y I mean , you gonna <disfmarker> we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . But , uh do w gonna <gap> gonna <disfmarker> are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ? How do you mean ? Th th the uh base in a in another <disfmarker> The rubber . How many colours are we <disfmarker> how many colours are we gonna <disfmarker> we're uh uh f uh f Only five minutes left , by the way . Yes . How many colours are we gonna give it ? Like two-tone colour ? T There there are three uh components three components type . Yeah . Uh no , not too much I think . You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th How the buttons <disfmarker> yeah . I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , <vocalsound> and the cushions as well should be in another colour . Yes . Or you just make uh one colour , uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , but not more than <disfmarker> In in another colour . Well , yeah , it's <gap> <disfmarker> Not more than two colours I think . No . No , definitely not . It's a g a little bit too flashy . Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . Yes , definitely . Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it <disfmarker> you can use two colours as well uh <disfmarker> Okay . But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons . The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . No . No , I think that's too vulnerable . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think this is okay , the <disfmarker> so we have the basic . Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button . The volume , teletext and <disfmarker> And maybe want to access a a menu or something . Yeah , but that's that's <disfmarker> I was thinking that's gotta be on the television . Most T_V_s have a menu . <vocalsound> Yeah , but I think you ha I really need a menu button . Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b That's just i the only button <disfmarker> only <disfmarker> Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? You know , I <disfmarker> Is uh <disfmarker> isn't that different from every television ? <vocalsound> No , I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . And so <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah , if it's c if <disfmarker> Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then . and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then <disfmarker> But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . No , you can use the <disfmarker> And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . Okay . Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem Mm , yeah . A mute and a teletext and a menu . uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . Mute . That's all . It's all we need . Yeah . Hmm . Okay , uh another stuf some stuff <vocalsound> about the the the design of the docking station . Great . Yeah . Okay , that's not mu not much functions . So <disfmarker> Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess . Yeah , definitely . Uh , in one colour . Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ? Just use <disfmarker> I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's true , that's true . And we will make it spongy and <disfmarker> and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did <disfmarker> I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w <vocalsound> Yeah , but we're gonna have to <disfmarker> we really have to think <disfmarker> I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but <disfmarker> and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you <disfmarker> <gap> it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . Yeah , definitely . Uh , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to <disfmarker> still have to think of how we manage to uh to get to that . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Guess we're through then . I guess so . Okay . But we <disfmarker> I think also we just <disfmarker> so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . I think that's uh adds to the <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . too much colour maybe m um <disfmarker> Too much colour , i it uh <disfmarker> when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe But our des design experts will uh work that out . Yea yeah . . It has to be <disfmarker> Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . Yep . Yeah . So we will wrap up . Something like that . Or is there anything we'd like to discuss ? I guess not . That's right . Okay . Do you , guys ? No . No ? Okay . Well , you will read the minutes uh in the <disfmarker> you can find them in the <disfmarker> In the shared folder . Oh , okay , yeah . pro probably . Yeah <disfmarker> uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out . What are we going to do now ? Uh , y yeah . You'll see in you email , I guess . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't know . I don't know . <vocalsound> I hope so . And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that . You see a kinda prototype you can <disfmarker> a little bit more uh <disfmarker> I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Construct one , yeah . But <gap> toilet paper roll and uh <disfmarker> With you laptop ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Oh my God . Alright , shall we get back to work ? Yep . Great . I was waiting for the l last message , but <disfmarker> Well you are . We're not . Yeah . <vocalsound> Bastard . Back to the pen . <vocalsound> You lazy <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm yeah . <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> Oh . Du Okay . Thanks for coming to this meeting . Hm . S how we doing on our remote ? <vocalsound> We have some <disfmarker> we have some ideas and some uh ideas for what people want . Uh we yes s I've lo <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think . <vocalsound> Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . Then I believe each of you have a presentation . Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully . And uh then we'll have the closing . <vocalsound> Um which we'll have forty minutes for . Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um <vocalsound> who was responsible for what . I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . Um <vocalsound> Ryan is our User Interface Designer . And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want . Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different . Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . Um and that was our last meeting . So um why don't um <disfmarker> Do each of you have a presentation ? Yep . Okay . I'll hand it off to you and um <disfmarker> Does anyone <disfmarker> do you wanna go first ? Sure . So we can maybe see what uh what the people want . <vocalsound> What was it ? Function ? Eight . F_ eight . F_ eight ? Well . <vocalsound> How do I get it <disfmarker> Slide show . To go to the next one ? Oh right right right . Yeah you click on that guy . That one ? Yeah . Okay . Alright . Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . Oh gosh , I've no idea . <vocalsound> G Just press the arrow keys I think . Usually goes to it . Okay . Sorry <vocalsound> I actually need to see something else on my screen . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hit F_ eight again . Yeah . I think . And then ? Again ? Yeah . You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ? No I want something else on mine . Is that possible ? Yeah but I think you have to hit escape . And then you can <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay but now you don't have that . Oh hit F_ eight again . <vocalsound> Sorry guys . I know . I did the same thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then it should come up here shortly . 'Kay . <vocalsound> So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and I think <disfmarker> oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? yeah . Yeah . Oh well . Mm . I'm not sure . You could maybe minimise that screen and then Yeah . have them both up at the same time I think . It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , <vocalsound> by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research . And I was sent a report that was <disfmarker> I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say . And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ? Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? Is is it j just just <vocalsound> Just jus just using it yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> yeah . Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take <disfmarker> thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . <vocalsound> A repetitive strain injury . What is it ? Just repetitive strain injury . I think . That's what I guess . Okay . Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at <disfmarker> the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think <disfmarker> and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . And that's it . 'Kay . Very nice . Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Wait can I look at that real quick ? <gap> . Oh yeah . Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? Yeah . 'Kay . Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . <vocalsound> <gap> Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . 'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . Um <vocalsound> the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . <vocalsound> And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to <disfmarker> i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um <disfmarker> Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . But one is uh user-centred . That is the one on the left . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is <gap> engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um <disfmarker> <gap> which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the <gap> have said and the market research and stuff <gap> probably looking at something that should be user-centred . Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away <disfmarker> if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under <disfmarker> some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um <disfmarker> Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings <gap> market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And that's it . <gap> cable there . Thank you . What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on uh the i On something on the image of it . the image of it . Uh the f the actual design . 'Kay . Good . Good . Okay . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . Right . So unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so um <vocalsound> I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . Um just <disfmarker> This is the basic basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . <vocalsound> Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more more used system . Um parts are cheaper as well . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . This is where my people screwed up basically . <vocalsound> So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . Right . Um which is usually a battery right ? <vocalsound> Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . This energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself <vocalsound> . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . That sends out the signal . Of course the signal differs accordingly . Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . And <disfmarker> Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response . Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well . <vocalsound> The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . Um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that <disfmarker> that's something we can discuss . And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . Who knows ? <vocalsound> Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact <vocalsound> available cheap enough , developed enough . But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to So we could <disfmarker> the the to the industrial design department . the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive <disfmarker> Expensive it's gonna be get uh . Yeah . But people have said that they would <disfmarker> well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . Mm-hmm . So Right . possibly it might be worth the investment . I think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o <gap> if it's on your phone . Yeah . <vocalsound> I agree . And you need to sort of take into light languages and then <vocalsound> different dialects I suppose as well . Well <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , Yeah . and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . <vocalsound> Yeah . So maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then And wou I don't know if would you know , you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting <disfmarker> Volume up . Volume down . Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ? Yeah . I I don't know . Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . I think <disfmarker> As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people . Mm-hmm . Yeah . But practically I don't think it's <gap> <disfmarker> It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and <disfmarker> Yeah . It'll wear off . Gets old yeah . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Let's see here . Do you wanna put your cord back in ? Yeah I guess so . Oh right . <vocalsound> Trade you . <gap> go . <vocalsound> Now I was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided <disfmarker> y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . Mm . So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . Um no teletext . Um <disfmarker> So we don't have to worry about that . Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . And we could probably get away with black too but <disfmarker> So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told we need to use . Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . We want something that looks good . Um we want something that's simple . We want something that you can find easily . Um <disfmarker> And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . It's gonna cost more . S Mm-hmm . the young the younger people say that they like it . But um it's probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . Um <disfmarker> And that way we can focus on our form . I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . Is that <disfmarker> if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . Um that you you should put it back in . Your remote . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep <vocalsound> to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought . That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . Yeah it would be quite good . The ball could sit on a <disfmarker> Or or with <disfmarker> you know I guess with any form that that would be good . Mm . You know that could be the charger . For Yeah . you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . And that would be <disfmarker> or solar . Or you know <disfmarker> However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . With the locator button . Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . Yeah . Um like Well you still do . if we still have the how to hold on to it You s you still <disfmarker> W yeah . You put it on t on the couch table . <vocalsound> Rolls away While you're watching , <vocalsound> It's gonna roll away . it's gonna roll off . yeah . So that's not an issue really . Um <disfmarker> So I guess after the meeting <vocalsound> we'll have some questionnaires . And uh and some summaries for for what's going on . Um then we'll take lunch . Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . Um <disfmarker> I'll do the minutes . Uh let's see . It looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . Um chips , the what chips we need <gap> . and what uh you know how to power it and whatnot . User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Minimal number of buttons . I guess our , I guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . Yeah . Right . That's <disfmarker> Did you have time earlier to to work on that . Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ? <vocalsound> Not really . <vocalsound> I'll yeah I'll have a look , try <gap> look at the actual appearance in the next break . 'Kay . I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . The ball is probably not a good idea . Mm . And even something that's held like that might be difficult . Mm-hmm . So that I think it still has to be a variation . On maybe a a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . Mm . Um <disfmarker> Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? That way we could l I mean if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ? Um <disfmarker> Would that <disfmarker> you think that would help us find um a specific form ? That we would would wanna pick out ? D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . Mm . I <gap> find anything more on that . Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . <vocalsound> 'Kay . So um we know that the remote's gonna have to be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . Yeah . Um yellow and <vocalsound> you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . Mm . And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom <vocalsound> Bottom perhaps or the yeah . you know . Um <disfmarker> Maybe we could sketch a <disfmarker> so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . You know . Um maybe we could flare it or something . You know . So it's more <disfmarker> of course this will look like a bone then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> go ahead and erase this . Um <disfmarker> Hope everyone memorised that uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You <disfmarker> I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . They've gone from big brick block things , which is <gap> a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things . Yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right ? Except for me now . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But they are all , <vocalsound> you know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . Yeah . Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . Mm . Right . But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big <vocalsound> and you had a handbag to carry it around in . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um <disfmarker> Hm . Um you know with minimal number of buttons . I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . Uh you've got volume , up and down . Channel up and down . Power . Power . Usually at the top . Um a mute . That's the classical design . That's that's pretty much all you need I think . Um <disfmarker> A menu button , maybe . Right . So you know . If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um <disfmarker> or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad . 'Kay so <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> Talk about maybe <disfmarker> <vocalsound> f Um <disfmarker> look at that from the side , there maybe . <vocalsound> Which is technically the easiest option . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So . Like a wheel on your mouse . Yeah , sort of like that . Sort of . You can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . Right . <vocalsound> 'S a good idea . Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on . Mm-hmm . I know . You know what I'm getting at here , Look g yeah . fel look at it from the side . It's <gap> like that . Mm-hmm . Looks good . Right . Uh <disfmarker> Then you hold it in your hand like this . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the <disfmarker> or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . Yes <vocalsound> To the thumb . To the thumb Yeah . Right . Mm . yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . Right . You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . Yeah . With the lesser used functions on this part , Behind . and then it slides into that part . And out . Definitely . <gap> just like o on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . So you know you just sort of have your hand Mm well I was just thinking , this this of course causes Yeah . Right on the <disfmarker> and your thumb would be up here type thing . causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So . Yeah that's also true . <gap> instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . Right . But I mean <gap> the older so Yeah <vocalsound> is everyone <disfmarker> who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? Right . You guys all right-handed ? Right . Right-handed , yeah . Yeah . So I'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's right . <vocalsound> Like the written language . <vocalsound> Or English . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . <vocalsound> Special order . Maybe . Ow . I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . Yeah . Um but that's that's good . That's <disfmarker> w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . Um <disfmarker> At least for what buttons we're gonna use . Um <disfmarker> So we've got uh <disfmarker> I like the scroll , the scroll action and the <disfmarker> <gap> . I mean I'm just just thinking maybe if it was um circular um with the sort of <disfmarker> that sort of <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . And then your thumb would do <disfmarker> you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right . Yeah . Kinda like holding a <disfmarker> Mm . Right . <vocalsound> That minimises it size-wise as well . <vocalsound> Minimise its size . It could be you know really quite small . Mm . Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off . Yeah . Hmm . Zapping functions . That's it . Could be good . Yeah . Maybe . <vocalsound> So two remotes in one . But then would be easier to lose one or the other . That's right . Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It actually is your coffee table . <vocalsound> Make it a piece of furniture . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> yes . Yes , there you go . Or a statue or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Well we need to finish up here . Um <disfmarker> So for the next <disfmarker> So for the next um <disfmarker> before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on <disfmarker> you're watching trends Mm-hmm . to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . Um <disfmarker> Yep . Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . Right . Let's go with our our uh rounded kind of fit in your hand <disfmarker> let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um <disfmarker> Alright . Yeah . <vocalsound> And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . So both of those concepts . How well it'll work yeah . And uh okay I think we made some good progress here . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> see you in <disfmarker> I dunno . I gu I guess we'll take lunch in about uh half an hour . <vocalsound> Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly <vocalsound> and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting . Yeah . Alright . Okay .
Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ? S Um , yeah , go for it mate . Um , N_E_Z_ N_ E_ Z_ . E_R_ . Ebenezer . And your role is ? I'm the Marketing Expert . You're the Marketing Expert , okay . Next we have ? Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ . T_ R_ I_ K_ . And your role in this is ? Industrial Designer . Industrial Designer . And , lastly we have ? Uh , Dave Cochrane . And you're going to be the User Interface , User Interface Defin Designer , yes . is it ? Designer . Okay . Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh <vocalsound> personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . This is how today seems to be going to work . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um <disfmarker> First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right . <vocalsound> What can I say ? <vocalsound> Ebenezer , you wanna have a <disfmarker> you wanna draw your favourite animal <vocalsound> ? Sure . <vocalsound> Whiteboard . 'Kay . S okay . I will make this quick , since we don't have much time . <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> 'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Here we have an elephant . First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , <vocalsound> and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant . So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer . Brilliantly done . Thank you . Thank you . <vocalsound> Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? <gap> . Oh . Oh <vocalsound> oh Oh , um , you can clip them to your belt . Do we take them off ? I think you ga Oh right , okay . You should also l um have your <disfmarker> the lapel mic on as well . The little <disfmarker> Ah-ha . The the <disfmarker> Oh that's good , we can clip them on . Okay . Yeah , <vocalsound> Now where do I put the <disfmarker> Just um somewhere <disfmarker> Yep , the <gap> , it's just across there , that's it . Yep . Is this supposed to be clipped as well ? I think so . Yeah . It'll follow you if you <disfmarker> Yeah . There you go . You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . Should have good range . <vocalsound> Uh , destroying your elephant here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , here we have a tiger . Uh <disfmarker> I've always loved tigers . They're just <disfmarker> they're big , they're biggest cats , uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was <disfmarker> looks the best , the stripes , orange . My dad used to talk about <disfmarker> he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was <disfmarker> when I was a kid . And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . So uh that's why I like them . Didn't say an anything about me really but <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Excellent , thank you very much . Dave , if you'd like to uh have a dash . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um , the monkey , um . The one f uh <disfmarker> in fact this is a <gap> somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh <disfmarker> well my <disfmarker> I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . Um , monkeys have attitude . Which I think is a good thing . And I mean fr <vocalsound> and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . Um , so I like monkeys . And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . <vocalsound> Cheers . Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , Yep . okay . Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . Yeah . Okay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you <vocalsound> you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of <vocalsound> three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . Okay . Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our <disfmarker> Absolutely prohibitive , yeah . yeah . Oh . But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g <vocalsound> I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some <gap> and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for <vocalsound> um running macros . Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of <disfmarker> For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um <disfmarker> 'Kay <vocalsound> Any takes on this ? Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , Mm-hmm . but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and <vocalsound> the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . So perhaps one that was more um Okay . specialised for game playing or interactive television . They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , Okay . you know that's <disfmarker> Yeah I've heard <disfmarker> I've seen the bar-code design before , Mm . yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , it's it's taken out the <disfmarker> Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . Okay , well 'Kay . we're beginning to run out of time now , so , Yeah . we've got a couple of ideas , we can <disfmarker> we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so <vocalsound> we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . Um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out What the user wants uh . what the user wants , yes . Okay . Um , right . Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? Oh . Okay , <gap> . Like uh control pads , you know of games , but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . or is that a bit ridiculous ? <vocalsound> I I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um Yeah . and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits <vocalsound> fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course , uh al al also allows for <gap> the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , <vocalsound> . Okay . So , small , stylish , and something that's just a little different . A curve , mm-hmm . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , <vocalsound> uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . Okay . That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . I would I would have hoped so anyway . Um , right . I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody . 'Kay . Yeah ? So . Okay . <vocalsound> <gap> . <gap> . Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .
Alright ? Alright . Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . Um <vocalsound> the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . Um and people lose them . And <vocalsound> We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um <vocalsound> that we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That <disfmarker> um <vocalsound> we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . So again um , I'll <disfmarker> we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . Um <vocalsound> now the the the internal chip um <disfmarker> and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice <vocalsound> and given that <vocalsound> th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm n not an expert on these things , <vocalsound> but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field <vocalsound> and uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um <vocalsound> go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . <vocalsound> Okay . Um <disfmarker> Kate . Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry . Um p there we go . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at <disfmarker> uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um . <vocalsound> Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip <disfmarker> the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh <disfmarker> which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels . <vocalsound> Um . Oh . <vocalsound> Uh cool . <vocalsound> Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . That's something we should think about . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . <vocalsound> Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be <disfmarker> allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , <vocalsound> Okay , so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . <vocalsound> And that pretty much sums it up . so how um <disfmarker> sorry , Mm . Oh yep , can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? Um . sorry . <vocalsound> Yep . Uh d d d <vocalsound> okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Mm . <vocalsound> Um Do we do we know uh by how much ? I don't actually have any price information , no . <vocalsound> And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . Um it <disfmarker> a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . Oh w yeah , we did <disfmarker> the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , Right , it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , okay . uh so it would uh <disfmarker> it's hard to predict the time . <vocalsound> Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , Mm . that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um I <disfmarker> h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? I just have a question about that . Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um W and that w just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world <disfmarker> the the sky is your limit , Okay . Then it doesn't matter . Okay . but to actually <disfmarker> the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . Okay . Cause uh I <vocalsound> must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean Yeah . I d d for slightly different <disfmarker> well no , I mean , it's if you you <disfmarker> speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from <disfmarker> is <disfmarker> this is the internal company information , is it ? Uh bits of it , yeah . So uh <disfmarker> Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , Yes , as well . <vocalsound> you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros . Yeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh <vocalsound> uh decide . <vocalsound> Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . Yeah . Mm . Yeah , that's that's right . It's like <disfmarker> it's it's <disfmarker> you can't <disfmarker> 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . <vocalsound> Yeah . But we don't know . Um . <vocalsound> I mean uh I su i I mean if <disfmarker> given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk , uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um . Thoughts ? Well , another thought I <disfmarker> Would <disfmarker> oh , sorry , go ahead . Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like um <disfmarker> maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . <vocalsound> I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to <disfmarker> I mean I think we <disfmarker> <gap> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> Mm . Hm . Okay . <vocalsound> Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . Yeah , I I I I I think that's uh <disfmarker> Mm . And we've been talking about it the whole time . Mm , mm . Yeah , yeah . Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . Mm , right , okay . Mm . Uh yeah , <gap> it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . Yeah . <gap> From uh my presentation show , so . Yeah , it should be <disfmarker> Uh technologically innovative . Right , okay , so . No , that sounds good . Mm . Fine . Okay . I it will have voice recognition um uh Mm . Cool . Okay . if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , <vocalsound> volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ? Yeah . Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah . I think so . Right . Okay . Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? Uh nope , No ? that was it , that was it . Okay . Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ? Okay . Okay . Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over . <vocalsound> Let's see . Mm . Oh good . Oh . Yes . Is it gonna work ? Yeah , Mm yeah , it's thinking about it . it'll get there . Yep . Okay . Okay , Yeah . so I did some research on the internet and um <vocalsound> what <vocalsound> <disfmarker> you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . Um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . Mm-hmm . There're some special ones available , like this one right here , Mm , yeah . which is marketed towards children , um different designs , Uh-huh . Alright . and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some <vocalsound> Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> So just kind of minimise the clutter , Mm-hmm . avoid too many buttons and also um <vocalsound> one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , Mm . and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . <vocalsound> Mm yeah . Sorry y y yeah , <vocalsound> if I can interrupt you . Well d <vocalsound> p 'kay , do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ? Mm . I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really . I I mean , I think it's just sort of <disfmarker> the the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> there's a lot of slide buttons out there . I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , fair enough , fine . Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down Mm . so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down Yeah . Good , good . and then the <disfmarker> Yeah . this is my great little drawing . So three three <disfmarker> there's three buttons on a slider . <vocalsound> Three buttons , channel up channel up down and <disfmarker> Y yes , yes . Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . Because if it <disfmarker> if you no <gap> if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of <disfmarker> if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean . Yeah . Mm . So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something . Uh-huh . So you kinda take it up one at a time . Okay . The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . D Um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Oh . This one on the one side and one <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh you could you could <vocalsound> as l as like a mouse you could <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , Yeah . Yeah . so it'd be kinda good to have them be <disfmarker> feel completely different . Yeah . You'd know what you were fiddling with . Yeah . Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , Yeah , That was <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> yeah uh th th the <disfmarker> I mean thi this is what the <disfmarker> with a <disfmarker> we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do . Mm . Yeah . Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a <disfmarker> uh volume and channel change Um well I was thinking kind of just for the volume , of one sort . Just for the volume , uh . but what what do you guys think ? Mm . Dep I dunno if it <disfmarker> We could <disfmarker> depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , <gap> it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , <vocalsound> and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , Fingers , yeah . 'cause if <disfmarker> yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the <disfmarker> that for rolling , It <disfmarker> yeah , I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it <disfmarker> the two are clearly different , B just the way it would <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . Oh yeah , yeah . So okay . Right so uh I'm just gonna pass this along . that's <disfmarker> sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo Yes . okay , fine . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm right . <gap> <vocalsound> Here we go . Right . <vocalsound> Uh yeah , this is my report on trend watching . Mm-hmm . The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions . <vocalsound> And uh the most important aspect is the l the look <disfmarker> it has to look fancy , look and feel Mm-hmm . uh instead of the current functional look and feel . This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , Mm . which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so uh <disfmarker> Well I I mean I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . <vocalsound> Uh exactly , yeah . Yeah . Mm . Okay . <vocalsound> I s that out of sequence ? Uh yeah , sorry . Uh yeah , and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Uh sorry , clothes , shoes and furniture Uh-huh . and uh a spongy material to be used on the <vocalsound> on the outside . <vocalsound> Mm I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . But uh I was gonna say um yeah , fruit and vegetables , uh important to <disfmarker> this year um important to furniture , What ? I'm just gonna say uh <vocalsound> f like it's in <disfmarker> if if fashion <disfmarker> if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . But fashions do don't last very long . Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , Yeah . Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it yeah . and then we can just whip that off and <disfmarker> Yeah , Uh . yeah . Yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights . You know , that kind of spongy <disfmarker> Mm , yeah , that weird <disfmarker> I dunno what that is , <vocalsound> Uh . but yeah . yeah . A kind of <disfmarker> yeah . Mm . Also means you can drop it without damaging it . <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh <vocalsound> , yeah , it's good as well . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> c cool . Yeah , that's true . Um <vocalsound> you have <disfmarker> we could <disfmarker> if we could save <disfmarker> depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I mean it its uh I <disfmarker> that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . Mm . Yeah . Um that's <disfmarker> Wh yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . Mm . Mm . What if we included the batteries in the cover ? Mm-hmm . Oh yeah . I like that . So um That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers like <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , so can I see that thing ? Um . S Just <disfmarker> this as examples . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah , I n I know <disfmarker> the only p So f I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it <disfmarker> y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together Uh yeah . Yeah , I guess that's Mm . and it it it <disfmarker> you know , total reliability , true . but I mean I d I I uh I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from . Or <disfmarker> well , but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different <disfmarker> like you've only got like , you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone . Mm-hmm . And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . And then <disfmarker> I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh <disfmarker> even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , <vocalsound> Yeah , you probably are right . then having <disfmarker> getting cheaper production costs um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh <disfmarker> a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't <disfmarker> it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . Mm . Yeah , that's true . Mm . Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . Yeah . Yeah , I mean it is <disfmarker> it's up to it's up to <disfmarker> Yeah , So , just another five Euro to get <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Yeah , it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . Mm . Right . Mm , yeah . Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . Mm . Yeah . And um <disfmarker> And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . <gap> that's that's right , yeah , yeah . Yeah , like they have for mobile phones Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly . that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . Yeah . Yeah , okay . So uh i so uh okay . <vocalsound> Um right , sorry . Um we hadn't finished your <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say uh <disfmarker> yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like uh <disfmarker> a part of the f like it it <disfmarker> the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me . Mm . Mm-hmm . Um this is fashionable . Yeah . This is fashionable with <disfmarker> Yeah . I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . Um , so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh <disfmarker> I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , Mm . um w we need to decide on the <disfmarker> just the basic shape of the thing . And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , Mm . you know , Oh yeah . t to deliberately get away from the uh um <vocalsound> uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um mm or uh <disfmarker> 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those . I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a <disfmarker> you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , Yeah uh the the uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> or or b Yeah , like an <gap> . but I'd <disfmarker> yellow seems a bit of a strong colour Yeah , to make the ent like the thing <disfmarker> I'd I'd um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . no , yeah . Uh no but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . I d I I agree , I mean we're we're we're simply <disfmarker> it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah <vocalsound> . Mm <vocalsound> . And make that a fashion symbol as well . <vocalsound> Well n Well , th this is <disfmarker> this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm <disfmarker> I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff . Mm-hmm . Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um <vocalsound> a shape that's almost like a mouse . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . So that , you know , when they hold it it's <disfmarker> because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and Yeah . Yeah . Mm . have the power , wherever , somewhere . Yeah . I mean that was just an idea that I had . I mean I've uh <disfmarker> yeah . Oh no that <disfmarker> well there's the sim <disfmarker> my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape Yeah . Yeah , maybe . so that you can just sort of ho hold it . Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though Kind of a c 'cause it <disfmarker> a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . W it <disfmarker> So maybe it'd be <disfmarker> Yeah . I mean <disfmarker> well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse , Sort of a combination . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . but held , you know , Yeah . so it's <disfmarker> you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . Yeah . Yeah , and fiddle around with it and press it . Yeah so <disfmarker> yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had <disfmarker> Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the <disfmarker> about the width of that end of the pen Yeah , and then it widens up top then wider up here . and you can fiddle an And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Mm . and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . Yeah , cool . What do you guys think about that ? Yeah , that sounds <disfmarker> Okay , yeah , yeah . Um I'm just <disfmarker> I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much <disfmarker> how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a very good point . It is a very good point . Yeah . I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . That um the <vocalsound> we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , Yeah . but that uh <disfmarker> yeah <vocalsound> . But <disfmarker> do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice <gap> 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that Then you just bring it up to your mouth and it's microphone-esque , and just speak to it , Yeah , and just say <disfmarker> yeah , yeah . yeah , yeah . Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . Mm . I th I th honest uh <vocalsound> my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um . Mm I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing . It's cer it's certainly possible I mean , but they <disfmarker> we we're going beyond w w Bu Mm . given the state of the technology <vocalsound> we want something that we kno we know will will work um . Hmm yeah . Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . I mean <vocalsound> uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and <disfmarker> or do voice commands , and <vocalsound> either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness Uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , that's a good idea . and and sc Yeah , I suppose I sup and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . Yeah . Yeah . If we we're <disfmarker> I mean <vocalsound> I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . So I guess we could have a menu button as well . Yeah <vocalsound> We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . Yeah . So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . Uh uh uh <vocalsound> Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . Do we need some sort of display ? But the television would be the display Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah . We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay . that <disfmarker> things like that usually c pop up on a televi Yeah , and then y like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . Well I mean on a <disfmarker> Yep . onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . Yeah , Yeah , press that yeah , that's true . is t yeah , that might work . I never understood how that worked though , but yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's like um <disfmarker> yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . You just press it . Yeah , mm . Yeah , and you could just click that to <disfmarker> so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . Mm , oka yeah . Yeah . Uh yeah . You know what I mean ? Mm yeah . Okay , we got five minutes to go in this meeting , Okay . so um I d I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um . <vocalsound> Cool . So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , <vocalsound> Play with play-dough . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . <vocalsound> Hmm . Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh <disfmarker> I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word <disfmarker> <vocalsound> um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . <vocalsound> Uh can I just get some things clear just for <vocalsound> my sake . Yeah , certainly , of course . Our energy source is gonna be I think I think we decided that we're gonna <disfmarker> for long term . for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um , Mm . Cool . Uh <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> you know , on the basis that um that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um <vocalsound> make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um . And we're having a custom chip ? <vocalsound> We're having a a custom chip , but given the the <disfmarker> we've cut the functions down , um that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that um technol technological innovation is important , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate . <vocalsound> Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . And interchangeable case ? I i interchangeable case seems to be um <vocalsound> um important to the concept . Mm . Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . And uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh <disfmarker> I mean uh uh this is totally new . Mm , mm-hmm . We d we don't know whether that <disfmarker> to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh <disfmarker> you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I won't mention any mention any names , <vocalsound> um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um the <disfmarker> that <disfmarker> I mean that's <disfmarker> no , because we've got so few buttons that it <disfmarker> that actually makes that redundant . Yeah , I think so too . Mm , does actually , yeah , yeah . Cool . Yeah , and especially for making them so like different and <disfmarker> Mm different to feel , Yeah , yeah . yeah , yeah . Yeah . And the <disfmarker> you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , Mm-hmm . Yep , yeah . 'cause that would <disfmarker> well that would clobber the battery life , Yeah . so no , Mm-hmm . I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> As uh as wide <vocalsound> Yeah . As wide as possible . <disfmarker> cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh <vocalsound> you know , i i it will work most of the time um . Like this or like this . Mm <vocalsound> yeah . Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um yeah , I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh . Yeah , Mm-hmm . kinda like this whole <disfmarker> Yeah , mm . So you could use like this and it would go <gap> . Um so <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah , 'cause I mean the r reality is people are <vocalsound> <disfmarker> they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , Yeah . then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want . Yeah . Um okay , d we're all clear where we go from here . <vocalsound> Yep . Yep , sounds good . Mm-hmm . Okay , so thank you very much indeed 'Kay . and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes . <vocalsound> Okay . 'Kay .
So we can start ? Yeah . Suppose I have to do my presentation . <vocalsound> Eh um <vocalsound> Ah okay . It's Ada Longmund ? <vocalsound> So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . So um we will have to um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . Record . So the project method is the following . So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . Uh . <vocalsound> The tool training is to try out the white board , Mm-hmm . so <disfmarker> Maybe someone ha we have to <gap> this whiteboard , yeah ? <vocalsound> Maybe you can draw your favourite animal <vocalsound> and make a list of its favourite characteristics . So right now ? I don't know if we have to do it now , So yeah I think you can do it . <vocalsound> maybe later later . Yeah , I don't know . <vocalsound> So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . <vocalsound> Twenty five Euros ? Mm . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it's quite good price , yeah . I it's it's reasonable , s quite <disfmarker> It's reasonable , I think , yeah . yeah . Twenty five . <vocalsound> And uh Is <disfmarker> it will uh be a an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um <disfmarker> with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with <vocalsound> remote const con controls , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> try to create something new and people would like to to buy . And <vocalsound> and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know <disfmarker> I suppose you know what you have to do . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I I hope so <vocalsound> And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI Yep . Yeah . and <disfmarker> okay . I_D_ , yeah . Yeah . So <disfmarker> I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ? Okay . And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , That's me . Okay , and Marketing Expert , it's me . yeah ? AMI yeah project . So I will manage all all the group . <vocalsound> you will be the manager <vocalsound> yeah <vocalsound> You can manage all this , yeah . Okay . Good . So you have questions ? Um . Not really . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> Yeah . you all know what the parts of the work you have to do . So which <disfmarker> you , the Industrial Designer . No I'm user interf I'm user interface design . I am the Industrial Design , yeah Okay . Mm-hmm . And you ? I am the Industrial Designer so . Mm okay . Okay . So Yeah . what's the difference between <vocalsound> user interface design d industrial design ? <vocalsound> Hmm . I mean , you have to know . Ah , you have to know it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's difficult . <vocalsound> It's your job , so I hope you you know what it is . You know very soon . <vocalsound> Yeah , I think so . So <disfmarker> Mm . I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . Okay , so I make uh u user interface . Yeah . You you de you implement the core functions in the <disfmarker> And i maybe you will transform it <vocalsound> . I I think the user the user interface design is <disfmarker> he will design how the user will you know <disfmarker> the relation between the user and you know the remote control so <disfmarker> Use it . Make make <disfmarker> yeah . And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like . Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . Yeah . So the materi I design the user f user interface , you design the function . Maybe , it is the outside and the inside . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay right . Okay . But <disfmarker> I was thinking that he's a user <disfmarker> 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . Yeah yeah . But I don't know . <vocalsound> Okay . Well . You know . I'm the industrial designer . Oh , okay , okay . Not the other one . So . Okay . Okay . So and the marketing expert will <disfmarker> Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have And <disfmarker> and then thi this would <vocalsound> I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer . yeah . Ok Okay . And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . Okay . So you don't have to do something really specific , Mm-hmm . as everybody everybody will have to use it , Mm . it's sor the same as keyboards . Yeah . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , Mm . Yeah . so really the remote control to be international . Okay . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And not too expensive . Yeah . And uh simple . As we want to maximise the benefit . And easy to use . And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so . <vocalsound> Yeah , Ah , yeah . you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros . That's the problem . It should be <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> So , is it okay ? Mm . It's clear . Yeah . <vocalsound> There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know . Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal . <vocalsound> Is it ? <vocalsound> Are we supposed to do right now ? <vocalsound> Yeah yeah , you try . Try first . <vocalsound> Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you think we have to do it now ? I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now . <vocalsound> You can draw something which is very simple . <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> You want me to draw something ? Everybody <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Product manager <disfmarker> okay , Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here . let's go , I will try . Kemy is really good at drawing . <vocalsound> Many <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think everybody should do it , so . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's not matter <vocalsound> So . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You're going to draw ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Uh it's the same as mine . <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> What's this ? It's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's a cat . It's a fat cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It is not a fat cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's the fat cat , okay . Yeah , it is a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Can you draw uh um rabbit ? <vocalsound> Oh , hat ha rat . A rat ? Yeah . That's difficult . Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat . No . A mouse is not too difficult . <vocalsound> It's your rat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's okay . Mouse is okay . Yeah . Just go , you you the closest to the whiteboard . Okay , go <disfmarker> <gap> right , but in grow , it's <disfmarker> Mm . Jus everybody has to grow <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . Oh . Okay , I draw . The only thing I can draw is like this . Oh . Oh . Oh . A duck . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You love the eyes . What are you <disfmarker> I don <vocalsound> What's this ? no idea , so <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , that was the eyes . Okay . A clown . <vocalsound> Rabbit . It's a rabbit . <vocalsound> Pikachu . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a rabbit . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . Bugs Bunny one . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . It's not so bad so . The only thing I can draw , because it's very simple . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . I go . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> What ? Oh . So what else ? This was my favourite one , <vocalsound> So you don't have a <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thank you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A fish . Right . A fish . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's a that's a fish ? Okay , <vocalsound> let's try to draw something . You forgot the chips . <vocalsound> Oh yeah , <vocalsound> doesn't look so fine . Have to be really careful . Fish and chips . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , Ah <vocalsound> it's my turn . it's your turn . Oh . Okay , be careful . Okay . So . <gap> <gap> It's ok <vocalsound> Of No problem , no problem . So , what can I draw some more ? Oh <gap> . <gap> ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> ? No . Mm <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's it's a se it's my priority this one . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . A person ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> It's a really crazy dog <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Dog . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Good . Transfer . It's a dog in a village . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So what are you sug going to do now ? <gap> I think it's done . Yeah , I think <disfmarker> It's done ? Yeah . yeah . Okay . Just have to <disfmarker> So we have break . present project , discuss a little bit about it . Oh my God . Oh , we have twenty five minutes for the meeting . Yeah . Okay . So , Oh . if you have questions . Hmm . <vocalsound> Know what time is it ? No . No . <vocalsound> It's okay ? Yeah , it's okay . You know your job ? you know your job ? <vocalsound> We have an idea yeah . <vocalsound> You know your job ? I have an idea of my job <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> yeah so . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Good .
<vocalsound> Good to see you all again . Let's see if that comes up . This is our functional design meeting . Um . Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up . Et voila . Okay . Mm um we put the fashion in electronics . Let's start . Okay , our agenda today um <disfmarker> just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . Um . I'm gonna do an opening , talk about um <disfmarker> did you all get the minutes ? I e-mailed them to you . I'm also putting 'em <disfmarker> them in the shared folder . Yep . So um then I <disfmarker> we'll talk about our general objectives Right . and have your three presentations . Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . Finally we'll just close . We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . So <disfmarker> First of all the functional design objectives . Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the <gap> functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um . <gap> Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ? Sure , please do . I dunno . How do I hook my screen up ? I think , you might have to disconnect Rose . Yes I do . Yeah . Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there Where does it go ? Mm-hmm . Hmm , I'm not supposed to move this , <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> Ah that's it , yep . <gap> And then you have to press function F_ eight I think it is on your laptop . Function , F_ eight , yeah . Where's function ? The blue one , F_N_ . No signal . Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and <disfmarker> Ah , wait , Yeah . 's screw in . I I think you just have to push it in really hard . Push the screw . That's it . Oh , got it . Mm 'kay . Mm alright It's taking it a little bit <disfmarker> I've never attached to anything . Mm , neither have I . 'Kay there you go . Alright , so , Alright . I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is . But , I don't even know how to play this . No . Press the little presentation . It's the um <disfmarker> it looks like a Y_ kind of <disfmarker> over there above Draw . There , that one , there you go . Alright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly <vocalsound> , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they <disfmarker> more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . I don't know anything beyond what fancy means , Hmm . but that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions . Um people also had certain frustrations , 'Kay . that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before Hmm . just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , because I don't know . Repetitive strain injury . What ? Repetitive strain injury . <gap> Ah . There we go . Wow . So if you <disfmarker> People do not like that . So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on . So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly <vocalsound> and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that . Hmm . Thank you very much . That was that was great . Mm 'kay . Um <vocalsound> 's move on to the next presentation um on effects . Was that you ? Hmm . Great . Yeah , have I unscrewed it ? Push . User interface , right . Interface . Here we go . Cheers . Mm-hmm . And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it . Mm 'kay , Okay , thank you . great . <vocalsound> Okay . Here we go . Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . Um . Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about <vocalsound> h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um , Hmm . and different different people sort of prefer different things . Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product . Hmm . So I had a look on the <disfmarker> on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things <disfmarker> what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . <vocalsound> Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , <vocalsound> so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can <disfmarker> you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . The one on the right is a lot more basic . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . So we've got to to find our <disfmarker> find a way of striking a balance between the two . Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . It it does everything that I need it to uh , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed . Mm 'kay . Thank you very much . That was very useful . <vocalsound> It's funny to see the <vocalsound> drastic difference between those two remotes . <vocalsound> Um . Hmm . And neither of them were very pretty , you know ? No . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think that could be our selling point . Mm . A fashion fashion remote . I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . Right . Mm . Mm-hmm . And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress . Hmm . Yeah . Right , I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> there it is . Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already . Lovely . So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ? Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah . Okay . 'Cause I was like googling Hmm . Yeah . and then I'm like wait <vocalsound> it won't let me google . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright um <disfmarker> No , how do I play again ? Um the <disfmarker> it's right above Draw . There are three thingy if <disfmarker> it's way at the bottom . Under three icons Ah . and it's the one that looks like a desk . Yeah , that one . There are Y_s <gap> . Okay . So this is our working design presentation . Um I had a bit of <disfmarker> some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's <disfmarker> we're still in early stages . Um so , yeah , this is this . Though th the thing about working design is the <disfmarker> what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but <disfmarker> how do I get to the next s ah . So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . <vocalsound> So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . So um <disfmarker> Uh . Uh . You just press <disfmarker> yeah , just click . That'll be fine . So the findings that I got uh very <disfmarker> just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . So that's one thing we're gonna work on . Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls <disfmarker> that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . You have your energy source right there which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip <disfmarker> ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh . Um yeah use that thing <gap> you can go back , previous . Previous . Sorry about that , guys . <vocalsound> Pardon . Oh . Oh , well . No , no , no , no , no . Okay . Okay , let's just get back to my schematic here . Ye Double click on it . With the right <disfmarker> with the left hand one . W yeah , yeah . I think it's frozen . Here . Don't show me that tip again . <vocalsound> There we are . There we are . Sorry about this , guys . <vocalsound> I'm kind of pathetic with things like this . Um alright . So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way . This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . Mm-hmm . And <vocalsound> personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated . We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated Mm-hmm . and go do it by hands . So that's pretty much it for the working design . Excellent . <gap> So , um . Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ? Yes , absolutely . Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things . Yeah . Lefty loosey , righty tighty , right ? Yeah . <vocalsound> What's up ? <vocalsound> Lefty loosey . <vocalsound> Lefty loosey , righty tighty . Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Never heard that before , <vocalsound> Oh yes . that's good . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'll think of that every time now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's gonna stick in your head . Yeah , that's a good one it'll stick with you . Mm 'kay . Um I have nothing on my screen . Just a sec . Mm . Here we are . Ooh , no signal . Okay , yeah , it's fine . Okay , requirements . We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this . Okay . We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um <disfmarker> well it <disfmarker> that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about um <disfmarker> we're not gonna worry about that . What's teletext ? Um . Uh , it's a British thing . Oh . Oh , You don't have it in the States ? so <disfmarker> No . <vocalsound> It <disfmarker> no . W d could <disfmarker> Oh , I didn't realise . would you care to explain it ? Um yeah , it's like a <disfmarker> I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , Mm-hmm . uh y and you type in the page number you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . <gap> S <vocalsound> Lottery numbers and sport scores . Yep , news headlines . But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about . How ? Oh . It's earl it's pretty old technology . It's like nineteen eighties . Okay . That explains a lot . I have no idea why we don't have it , but <disfmarker> That's good . <vocalsound> Interesting . Okay um , well , we're not gonna <disfmarker> the management has decided we're not gonna work with that . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on . Right . Um otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out um very quickly . We only have a a short amount of time . 'Kay . Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . Mm . So what's our corporate image like ? It's <disfmarker> It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics . Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that <disfmarker> the emphasis on the R_s in um <disfmarker> It's like double R_ . mm-hmm . Yeah . But it's , yeah , we put the um fashion in electronics . So we gotta keep that in that in mind . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so we want something that looks good Yep . Yep . and is yellow . Yeah , or <vocalsound> ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . Okay . Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit . Um . Okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . We need to decide who our target group is . You um in your analysis of different market um <disfmarker> of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things Mm-hmm . or had certain preferences , for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition , Mm-hmm . but younger people did . Um and so who are we aiming this at ? Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion <disfmarker> we put the fashion in in electronics then you <disfmarker> automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that <disfmarker> that's <disfmarker> who's gonna be attracted to this . <vocalsound> Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? Mm-hmm . It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is . Mm-hmm . Is it <disfmarker> is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it . Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself . Right . Right , okay . The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . Mm-hmm . I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . Yeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us . Yeah . <vocalsound> Now , those are <disfmarker> that's all specific for speech recognition . Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ? Um . Mm . I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying Mm-hmm . uh , well , uh we've got a price limit of <disfmarker> was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for <disfmarker> to produce it ? Mm . To produce it , yeah . To produce it , yes . And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . Mm . But what else are we gonna put , I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . So like other than just making it look good , how is it <disfmarker> Yeah . Hmm . I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons But <disfmarker> and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ? right . Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , Mm-hmm . in fact it could use <disfmarker> it could mean , not . That's a good thing to keep in mind . If <vocalsound> <disfmarker> they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology . If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? I dunno . Upgrade ? Well , we can look for <disfmarker> we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly . Yeah , simplification . Yeah . Simplification , Mm-hmm . They could have a crap remote so <disfmarker> that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it . Mm-hmm . Uh-huh , mm . And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or <disfmarker> Hmm . Can you like <disfmarker> Yeah . I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , Ooh . but the rest of them like went in . The remote <disfmarker> Do you know what I'm saying ? There are remote controls like that , Kind of pull out of the side . yeah . Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it Mm . that hides all the complicated buttons . Ooh . So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down Mm-hmm . and there's all the <disfmarker> all the special buttons . Mm-hmm . 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them Mm-hmm . and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has Yeah , that's a good idea . more complicated ones , Yeah . Mm-hmm . but 's all still in one . I think that's a good idea , yeah . Mm . Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information , Yeah . but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing . Um . Good point . Yeah . Yeah . Okay um , so what are we emphasising ? I <disfmarker> what in this project ? Si simplicity and fashion . I think simplicity , fashion . Simplicity and fashion . Yeah mm . Okay , those are very good goals , I think , um that we have to keep in mind in <disfmarker> with everything we do . Simplicity and fashion and , yeah , <disfmarker> or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , Mm-hmm . so that you don't have to travel around a lot . Yeah . Yeah . What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , Um . like why would it not be ? I'm just wondering . I think it's a lot <vocalsound> to do with battery , Okay . but that's just my <disfmarker> The battery and that <disfmarker> I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . Mm-hmm . So 's just the quality of the chip . Yeah . I think so . Okay . The quality <vocalsound> uh quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything <disfmarker> shoddy work , 'cause it's Yeah . gonna be visible down the line . So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing <disfmarker> S voice recognition , Yeah . which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , Yeah . I don't . like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know . It's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech . Mm-mm . Seems a little bit <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , and it might be too expensive . <gap> And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote Mm-hmm . you'd just talk to your T_V_ . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , Ooh . <vocalsound> who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm yeah . Maybe <disfmarker> I I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . which isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so <disfmarker> Yeah , <gap> but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . Under sixty five , okay , Yep . that's a good start . Um . I'd say we're <disfmarker> uh can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? 'Cause that would go up to like fifty ? Or like single professionals or something . Twenty to like fifty five . Okay , single <disfmarker> Yeah . I dunno . It's it's hard to narrow it down . It's really hard to figure out right now . I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . Mm-hmm . I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , Okay . and that might be older people , Mm-hmm . but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . Yeah . Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , maybe we can define it by like the demographic of Right . like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , Yeah . Yeah aim for a <disfmarker> an income group . like , well That's a good point . obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing . Yeah . Mm . So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is <disfmarker> Yeah , t probably . Yeah . because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but <disfmarker> Okay . Um oh , there're a couple functions <disfmarker> do we want something so that <disfmarker> do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? Mm . Yeah . Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something , I don't know like <disfmarker> or beep ? H I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . Mm . It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , Mm . Yeah , that'll probably be good . so <disfmarker> Okay , we have to <disfmarker> we have about four minutes left to define our functions . So let's do that quickly . Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost . Yep . Yeah . And <vocalsound> we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . Yeah . Yeah . Large , accessible buttons for the essentials . We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features . Mm-hmm . Hmm . Um , yeah , hidden way . And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah <disfmarker> <gap> on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Alright . Okay , do it . Any other essential functions that we need ? Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ? Battery battery use . Yeah , but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really . Yeah . But we might as well . So you never have to change the battery . Yeah . We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . I suspect the remote control does need a battery , but Yeah , I would imagine . Yeah . I dunno if you can <disfmarker> Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . It <disfmarker> I think it does . I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . Yeah , without the energy , yeah . But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod . Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah . You could <disfmarker> we could maybe do that instead . So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery . Charging . Yeah . I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it <vocalsound> it stays in one place . Mm-hmm . Mm . We have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're <disfmarker> Mm . I mean , would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? I don't know , just think <disfmarker> okay , that's <vocalsound> that's a good idea , we'll keep it . Yeah . Think it's <disfmarker> That's just off the top of my head . And maybe fun . Okay . Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions and <disfmarker> Yep . 'kay . Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries <disfmarker> summary . I don't know what summarisation . Um and then we'll have our lunch break . After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great . Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , <vocalsound> market trend wa watching . And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could . Yeah , It's kinda frustrating , who knows . but um <disfmarker> Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary . Okay Mm 'kay ? Sounds good . Great seeing y'all . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's good . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Did you um <disfmarker> were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? Yes , I just did that . Okay . Hopefully it is there for people . Yep . Yeah ? Looks like there are um <disfmarker> looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's <disfmarker> that I didn't do , Yeah . it's from like an earlier project , I think so um <disfmarker> Okay . Where is that ? Yours is <disfmarker> Under the shared folder , I don't know it might not even be under yours as well . Technical . So in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . Projects . At least that's what I have in . I only have three , I just have like our three . Yeah . Yeah , that's what I have as well , R Rose <disfmarker> Okay . So . You don't have mine ? No , but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server . S Yeah . Mm . But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there . Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the <disfmarker> Okay . Well I'll figure that out in the meantime . Okay . Okay . Okay .
Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . Again , I'm gonna take minutes . Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . <gap> Uh , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? You two guys ? Yes . Okay . Go ahead . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <gap> coffee . <vocalsound> 'Kay , we've made a prototype . Um , we've got uh <vocalsound> uh our aspects from the last meeting . Uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . Um , we've uh drawn here the p prototype . The logo is uh is uh <vocalsound> is pretty uh <vocalsound> obvious to see on the on the remote control , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher . Um , <vocalsound> our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . Maybe you can uh point them uh <disfmarker> The functions . Uh , well the uh <disfmarker> all the functions are discussed uh <disfmarker> I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . Uh , it's a little bit . Uh , power button . Uh then the the the nine uh channels . <vocalsound> Uh the volume uh uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I thought that was th Alright , I <disfmarker> Oh , the mute button . Do y do you <disfmarker> Yeah . did we want to have a m mute button ? But uh that <disfmarker> It's uh here then , in the middle . Yeah . Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button . Huh . Yes , um we've disc <vocalsound> Well , yeah mo uh mo Yeah , well most of them are right-handed . Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the <disfmarker> on <disfmarker> Most of the users Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah well , I don't have time in uh anymore on the <disfmarker> Yeah , and a and a triangle on that . Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think . Yes . Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wait , there's <disfmarker> was one thing I wanted to ask . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh <vocalsound> do uh like <vocalsound> uh d I call it teens and twenties . Uh , y th th th the two numbers . Yes . All n no , that's um <vocalsound> kinda dependent on the television . Yeah , true , yeah . It's a television . Yes . Yeah , Uh <disfmarker> but do we have <disfmarker> do we need extra buttons , <vocalsound> for example some uh some have to <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> Uh I think so . Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I think you should add <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Zero ? A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line . May maybe here ? Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , yes . becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds <disfmarker> Yeah . And then a second . No , that's dependent on the television . No , I don't think so . Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press <disfmarker> I do know so . Is it depending on television ? Nah , I don't think so really , Yeah . because you have a <disfmarker> I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty <disfmarker> uh a number in the twenty or in the ten . Yes , but but a lot <disfmarker> uh <disfmarker> Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they come with the television . Or actually , the other way around . But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , I think <disfmarker> uh I really think it's n because you can <disfmarker> when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , Yeah . because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply . Yes , but Yeah , well <disfmarker> but su <vocalsound> If <disfmarker> some televisions don't accept uh that that <disfmarker> Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing . No , no , but s No no no . So some television respond differently . Look , if uh i i No , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . Yes . Yes , that's true . The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . Yeah . True . No <disfmarker> I think it works that way , really . No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space . <vocalsound> Yeah , but it's exact the same <gap> that w would appear when you put a separate button <disfmarker> push a separate button . Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons . Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . Yep . <vocalsound> True . I think it's exact the same thing when y You want <disfmarker> Yes , but some television don't support it . No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing . But the ex Listen , with <disfmarker> that that's that special but button <gap> you're talking about , eh ? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in <disfmarker> on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Do y you <disfmarker> the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had <disfmarker> No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c No , a remote can <disfmarker> Yeah . Yes , so they need <disfmarker> no , they need <disfmarker> But you give the input . You push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it <disfmarker> No , that's not true . It's simply not true . It's simply not true . yes it it is . Think about it . Yeah . No , but uh <disfmarker> You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . Remote control is a stupid thing . If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television . Yeah , that's true . Yeah , but I m uh but it's <disfmarker> I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . Yeah , it <disfmarker> But okay , we we'll impl No , definitely not . Definitely not . We'll discuss them in the usability lab . No , <vocalsound> we'll apply them then for now . Uh eva evaluation . I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary . Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . Yeah ? Yeah , I think so . Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input . Yes . Ach . Yeah but <disfmarker> Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . okay . <vocalsound> What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , Yeah . Yeah . but I still think i it it <disfmarker> all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . No , no . I think it's more c is m maybe we don't <disfmarker> uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press . I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M Uh , some <disfmarker> N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten <disfmarker> Th won't work wi with uh <disfmarker> No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . to have that special button . When you uh press one button , you give one signal . And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . But <disfmarker> Yep . Okay , well we'll see . When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals , it could work , but <disfmarker> Just a basic idea of of of the most uh <disfmarker> most y most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote . Okay . I kinda miss the docking station . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yes . It's here on the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , uh there's nothing <disfmarker> We came uh <disfmarker> I think it's pretty basic , the the <disfmarker> there's no fu Yes . there's one there's one button , No nothing really trendy about it . that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , The button . because Real <vocalsound> Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . Yep . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh uh hearing devices . I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices . Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , of course . when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Well it it got it <disfmarker> it has got to fit into the shape , of course . Yes , but we can make <disfmarker> The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same . Yeah , that's true , but uh <disfmarker> When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . Yes , but uh I I g Just have to be big enough for the biggest <disfmarker> Shouldn't it fall then ? It <disfmarker> isn't going to fall down ? <vocalsound> That's a bit uh <disfmarker> yeah , I think <disfmarker> No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . But then it's a little bit <disfmarker> No , but if if <disfmarker> like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , But it's just an idea . I won't draw it really . If you got a base which is uh as big as this <disfmarker> But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . You can . Yeah sure , But i i i it's backwards . but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big <gap> <disfmarker> But it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station . Yeah . Uh , wha what you could do if you uh <disfmarker> from the bottom <disfmarker> oh , right , help . That's text . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh <disfmarker> in in the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes , little holer <disfmarker> littler <disfmarker> Uh , little products go deeper in it . Yeah . That i that is possible , yep . Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues <vocalsound> still to come . Yeah , sure , you're right . Yes . And uh uh Oh . But we have to look n I don't know . the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , I don't like the colours . because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Then your uh left thumb of uh <disfmarker> your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button , which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb . So it's it's it's really good design . Okay . Yeah . Alright . Yes . That's it ? Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it . The light . Okay . And other lights ? I think added lights are gonna be a problem too . Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it . No , o on the on the front . Yeah , okay . Maybe the uh the logo . Yes . <gap> lights ? But , it will also uh uh use batteries , Yeah , why not ? and do we want to <disfmarker> Of course . Okay . For now , uh this is uh is good enough . Mm . Okay . Yeah , what was uh on the <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh <disfmarker> Okay , but in the <disfmarker> oh yeah , the colour , because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? Yes . Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . And they're be a <disfmarker> <gap> they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . Yes . Yeah . Uh , in the same colour as the side . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I think I think that'll be good . Okay . And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff <disfmarker> Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , Yes . so it will uh <disfmarker> Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later . Yes . 'Cause I also don yeah , Yep . it's depends on the costs and such . Yeah . But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . Okay , for now this is this is okay . We will . Um , the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ? Uh , I have to see the agenda . Well , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah . No . <gap> <vocalsound> Detail design . We gotta do that on the right <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the most <disfmarker> right-most screen , because the leftmost <disfmarker> Evaluation criteria . Yep , that's me . Okay . Okay . Alright . I will be needing that image , so leave it please . Um <disfmarker> Go away . Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . <vocalsound> Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . <vocalsound> I wanna have a colour over here , come on . Right , the remote <vocalsound> is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but the positive things has to be on the left , so I <vocalsound> said not ugly instead of ugly . <vocalsound> Uh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ? Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . Uh , I mean it's kind of <gap> , our design . It's <disfmarker> Yes . so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . Yeah . Background colour . I don't know or uh I don't know how you <disfmarker> How do you guys feel ? I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own <disfmarker> Casting . Yeah . The different designs . yes , you can make it in your own uh <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . Okay . more to your own personality or or house style . Yeah , but we d we didn't <disfmarker> we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . No , not not fronts , but different designs . With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay . No , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , yeah . Yes . And that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess . Okay , but <disfmarker> Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our <disfmarker> What ? Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally . Or forty . Yeah . <vocalsound> Personally . We can make it a one . Yes , but what is it ? I think two or three . <vocalsound> Guido ? Mm yeah . I agree . Two or three . Um , I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two . I was <disfmarker> I was thinking about three , so I guess Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh <disfmarker> three is uh a bit uh <disfmarker> Okay , three . oh , what am I doing ? I'll mark it . The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy . Yeah . Yeah well , let that <disfmarker> let's make that a one . <vocalsound> Yes . Two . Yeah ? One . One . Antek , you agree ? Yes . Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree . Yes . Yeah . You're not Antek . That's one thing for sure . I'm the I'm the usability , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I totally agree . The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . Yes . Yeah . Yeah , two or a one , I guess . The <disfmarker> It's something we really put work into . Yeah , I <disfmarker> yeah . I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . It's all about the buttons . <vocalsound> And our <disfmarker> oh yeah , it's a b yeah . Yeah ? Alright . That's a one ? You agree ? Yeah . The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . I think we totally succeeded there . But <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . Oh <disfmarker> Yeah , well menu <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe . Yeah , that's true . That's true . And telete Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , Yeah , we don't know if the <disfmarker> uh they're necessary . <gap> the the <disfmarker> o they're used uh uh <disfmarker> yeah , m well , you d you've got a point . I think a two . Yeah , true . Yeah , I agree . Can <disfmarker> yes , three , two . Came a long way , but not <disfmarker> we didn't not uh <disfmarker> Two or three ? Mm two . Two ? Antek . But you can't make a remote control without them , Because we got <disfmarker> because <disfmarker> Nay that that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed . No , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> we put it on a two ? yeah . Yes . The remote control has got a really trendy look . <vocalsound> Yes . A one . Maarten . Yeah , uh a t I think a two . Well . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture . Yeah . We <disfmarker> we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever . Yeah . Ever , yeah . <vocalsound> Guido . But I do think it's more <disfmarker> Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh <disfmarker> yeah . I I th But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . Yeah , uh I agree . I agree . Yes . <vocalsound> So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the <disfmarker> Yeah . True , yeah . I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh <disfmarker> A th a three . oh , yeah , that's true . You agree on the two ? Yeah . Yes . I i uh when you compare to the <disfmarker> Great . Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . Uh uh what's the difference with <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , I copied that one . <vocalsound> Well , uh forget that . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Go away . Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . No . We're not <disfmarker> No . No . No , not L_C_D_ , so . well , maybe the the the <disfmarker> on the side . Yeah , but we uh <disfmarker> <gap> you mean the rubber stuff ? Yeah , and the light . Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . And the light maybe . But that that's not innovative . But <disfmarker> And I don't u also it's also really not innovative , Well , I g Lights lights are <disfmarker> it's more <disfmarker> It's not <disfmarker> seven ? No , six . Well , six . Or seven maybe , <vocalsound> yeah . No , six . Six . Or six . Why uh why not a seven ? Six . Yeah , mine is seven . Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative , Yeah . but it but it <disfmarker> How ? Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe <disfmarker> With the lights it <disfmarker> it's it's kind of future <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it . Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ? Well , it's n true . Uh , I agree , m but <disfmarker> But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the <disfmarker> with <disfmarker> Innovative in generally or just f original for <disfmarker> I'll <disfmarker> Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . N no no , Yeah , it it's <disfmarker> I think I think with its <disfmarker> t <gap> . A docking station is innova Yeah , I mean the dock station , but but uh , I think the the docking station , <vocalsound> it's gonna be a <gap> kind of a problem . It's a part of the remote . <vocalsound> I think more m Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And with the speaker on the <disfmarker> there's also a speaker . But <disfmarker> Uh that <disfmarker> that's n Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . Well I i <gap> yeah . Okay . No ? No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we <disfmarker> Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev It's it's a six . six maybe , Six . because <disfmarker> But the retrieval or the <disfmarker> That m f Yeah , for the retrieval function . Yeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very <vocalsound> inno yeah . Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control . Yes , Yeah , v <gap> how would you innovate a remote control more ? Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and <disfmarker> To put it on your head . no no , you know what I mean . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You have <disfmarker> <gap> must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah sure , but <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , it's <disfmarker> But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , that's that's <disfmarker> think about it la later on but <disfmarker> and uh <disfmarker> Remote control is easy to use . <vocalsound> Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least . Yes . Yeah , a two . Yes . I think a two . Yeah ? Yeah , it's good . More two . Come on . The remote control hasn't got uh <disfmarker> <gap> . No , I would have seen <vocalsound> that one before . <vocalsound> Oh , you skipped one uh <disfmarker> I've just filled <disfmarker> uh Uh , here . Go away . You like the buttons . <vocalsound> I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . Remote control will be bought by <disfmarker> It will be bought by people under the age of forty . Yes . Yeah . Definitely . Yes . In in <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ? No no no . No , just if they if they buy it . Uh , just in general . Yeah , a two . We don't know . Yeah , but I think I think two . But <disfmarker> Yeah , what do you think ? Yeah , I think two , yeah . I agree . Two . Antek ? Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly . Uh , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty . No , that's no comparison . Yeah , you can <disfmarker> yeah , you can be very picky about it . And I don't mean two people . This is just guessing . Ah yeah , just make it <disfmarker> we'll make it a two . Make it a two . W w When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu Right , the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . Oh no . Yeah . Yeah , you have make an We don't have the slogan though . <disfmarker> slogan is quite obvious <gap> . Oh , the slogan . Oh the <disfmarker> oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . Can we see the slogan ? The logo . Yeah , you can put that on the side if <vocalsound> if we would like to . A logo . Underneath it or something . Yes , uh encrypted uh with <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . Are we gonna do that ? <vocalsound> A three . Three . Maybe a three this time . Yeah , a three . Yes . Three ? I agree . Because of the slogan <gap> <disfmarker> And uh <disfmarker> Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users . Uh , it's a one or a two . Yeah , two . Yes . Two ? Yeah , make it a two . Two . Two . Alright . We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . Twenty six . It's a two point six . It's not that bad . Alright , we <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , Yeah . True . which is uh quite a great score . Okay . Uh , this is <disfmarker> was uh the evaluation ? <vocalsound> This was my evaluation . So <disfmarker> Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has <disfmarker> We did a pretty nice job until now . Yeah . Um , is this your <disfmarker> Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or <disfmarker> Whatever . Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire . No . Okay . Okay , yeah . <vocalsound> Still opened or uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Okay , finance . Because um <vocalsound> Shoot . I received uh a spreadsheet . A five . A five . Yeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . Oh . Doesn't matter . I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin uh I have a <gap> . <gap> Didn't really finish it . Well , we uh <disfmarker> We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems . We probably will . <gap> I probably have already opened it here . <gap> try it again . First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . But let's let's st start with beginning . We include one battery . I i uh I'll explain its <disfmarker> Uh , the the components are listed over here . Uh , price is given . We um <disfmarker> yeah , The amount , yeah . we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet . I don't know if it's filled in properly . Okay , we need one battery . One battery . I think one battery is enough . Yes . We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips <disfmarker> Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it . Okay . But <gap> <disfmarker> The simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh <disfmarker> I don't know <disfmarker> Where did we find this information ? I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really . Was it <disfmarker> No , uh I <disfmarker> I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . No . Yes , Yeah . my my my uh <disfmarker> The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip <disfmarker> maybe . Yeah . And how do you know ? I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ? Bec No , the <disfmarker> they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it . Maybe you can uh look it up right now . Okay , but <disfmarker> okay . When we don't <disfmarker> when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what <gap> <disfmarker> Then it's a simple chip . then it would be a simple chip . And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . Yes , Alright , I I I s I <disfmarker> well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . Okay . That will be enough for future uh recommendations . Yeah , but it will it will it will be <disfmarker> cause a lot of problems . <vocalsound> The sample sensor <disfmarker> sample speaker . What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is . I don't know it uh either . I don't know . Okay , we went for the double-curved case Yes . made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour . I guess that's what we were <disfmarker> Well , special colour . <gap> . Yeah , I don't know about the special colour , Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour . but I think w uh <disfmarker> I don't know if it's very special . I don't <disfmarker> Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours . Mm okay . Standard rubber . Alright , that's okay . Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . St <vocalsound> Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ? Whoa , it's a little <disfmarker> Yes . Well that's bit of a problem , because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet . <vocalsound> That's huge . No . We have <vocalsound> the simplest buttons . No . No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . Yeah . I don't think so , because it says amount . If you use a scroll-wheel <disfmarker> Ah . Yeah , it wouldn't <disfmarker> The the the yellow row is the amount of <disfmarker> Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the <gap> and the total cost <disfmarker> I don't know . Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . I You can have f four kind of push-buttons . Rubber . Uh , one til nine . You can have uh <disfmarker> Is that one or is that nine buttons ? And I count them like this . One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . Yeah . Because <disfmarker> Oh , this is <disfmarker> oh , this is one , okay . Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um To n as uh uh uh separate buttons . that's total of four buttons . Different , yes . Yes . And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen . I think that <disfmarker> Eighteen . One two three four five , si Why is that so uh expensive . Yeah , I don't understand . Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ? Fifty cents for one single stupid button . So , whe when you <disfmarker> so then it <disfmarker> No way . Well , okay , well well let's make it just one . It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of <disfmarker> Here , now it's now it's already s Yeah , exactly . Yeah . shall we just give our own interpretation to , <vocalsound> because else we would really have a problem . It would be impossible to make it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I can't <disfmarker> I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really . It's way <disfmarker> When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . And and less buttons than this isn't possible . Yeah , yeah , <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And then throw it <disfmarker> This is the most simple <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , no no . yeah , it is possible , but I've never seen one before . But whe <vocalsound> I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , No , really . <vocalsound> Yeah , without the numbers . That's possible . Yeah , uh <disfmarker> Yeah , we could skip the numbers . but but <disfmarker> Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really . That's still four . Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control , Yeah . but but it isn't fo Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible . Yes , it's for <disfmarker> it's li uh it's just for a little <disfmarker> Yeah , that's no option , that's no option . Okay , we'll we'll just <disfmarker> okay . But then still , <vocalsound> when we <disfmarker> there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh <disfmarker> oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it <disfmarker> this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess . <vocalsound> A special colour , why a special colour ? Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . But wha what s what special ? Otherwise , it <disfmarker> I think that's the <disfmarker> what they mean by a special colour . Okay , yeah . Otherwise it would be the <disfmarker> I don't think the special form is really true . Uh , yeah . I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it <disfmarker> Special form also , it says . Yeah , special material r also , Is it ? because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber . What is the normal material ? Yeah , I dunno . Plastic . <vocalsound> Sh yeah . Plastic , I think . Classic ? Plastic . Plastic . Oh , plastic . 'Kay , but the problem now is that <vocalsound> the <disfmarker> There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . Yeah . <vocalsound> But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Separately . Se no no no . yes . And and <disfmarker> but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of <disfmarker> can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> It uh <disfmarker> but it <disfmarker> then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can <disfmarker> No . No , but you <disfmarker> otherwise you can't retrieve it . but then you still have to use <disfmarker> we have to find out what chip we u need . Yeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . I think we can agree on this . I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked . 'Cause I think we uh <disfmarker> Yeah , yep . Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean <disfmarker> But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station . I think so , too . Oh , I don't know . But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only <disfmarker> we also need a simple chip . And then we can get a docking station . <vocalsound> And maybe then we can do something extra . For <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh , n uh oh , still <disfmarker> <vocalsound> oh , it's gonna get more expensive with <gap> . Two . Then we have some money left . We can put then <disfmarker> For two Euros . We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh why ? Yeah , well who knows . I mean i i if you <disfmarker> Or a little bit of tin titanium . if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it . But what what can we do <disfmarker> Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea . But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know <disfmarker> If if i then we exactly know what it will cost us . Maybe is that <disfmarker> that's nice to know . Regular chip and <disfmarker> because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example . Yeah , bu bu but when we <disfmarker> I like the hand dynamo part . yeah , but when we skip when we um <disfmarker> when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still <disfmarker> yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , because that was our our special feature . We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . Yeah . We'll go back uh tomorrow . <vocalsound> I mean <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe <disfmarker> Wi wi without recharge <disfmarker> It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material . Yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . I mean , it has a shape . Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still <disfmarker> maybe we have to use the advanced chip , Of course it has a shape , but i i then two Euros isn't even possible . Why should that not be possible ? Yeah , then <disfmarker> because then we'd <disfmarker> thirty cents left . No , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . Yeah , but <disfmarker> yeah , I don't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip . That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f Yes . Yeah , and w and and we uh need f It isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either . and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker . It isn't in my information , I uh I <disfmarker> I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> You can look at it for s presentation . S technical functions ? No . Uh I've got here in uh <disfmarker> No no , they were uh mine , yeah . I will put a I will put a page on it . Oh . When my mouse works again . Oh , oh oh . Hey . Oh . My mouse is uh <disfmarker> Dead . Yes . Reanimate it . Oh . Died . Ah , I've got it . I will put uh my email on the the network . What the hell are these ? It's on it . Oh , whatever . Yeah , it's open . <vocalsound> Mm . I don't think here <disfmarker> it's in here already . It's circuit board . It's only just basics for for <disfmarker> It's nothing about s yeah . Yes . At the end circuit there is an infrared LED . This isn't helpful . No . But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . Which one was it ? Components design . Functional requirements ? Um <disfmarker> No , that was my presentation . Components design maybe . Yes , that was mine . N on top . Ah . Ah yes , it was the second one . But that was my second <disfmarker> Yeah , it was your second <disfmarker> It's already open . your first presentation . It's at the bottom . Working design . Sorry ? It's uh at your task bar . Yeah , but it's the the other one . Oh . Mm <disfmarker> Uh , this is n this is not this n Was it working design or components design ? Sorry . that's not the right one . I don't <disfmarker> oh . Okay , sorry . No , this is the other one . Or maybe something is uh <disfmarker> maybe there's something abo in in these <disfmarker> Chip set . But this is the same uh <disfmarker> This is o only the possibilities . Here . Yeah . We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything . The display requires an advanced chip . You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> Ah , okay . Okay , so we only need a simple chip . Requires . With the light . Little lights . Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED . No no , that's just a simple chip . That's not needed . A scroll-wheel <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them . A display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . For showing text . L_C_D_ . Yeah . I don't think that uh just a l a little light <disfmarker> No . I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay . Yeah , I agree . And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down . Yeah . Yeah , I guess so too . Yeah , true . Next channel . Well , that's not too <disfmarker> what we want . No . Well , we might want it , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> All in twelve Euros . Back to the costs . Yeah . Twelve Euros and fifty cents . So we're gonna use the simple chip . So , simple chip is okay . Great . Delete . Yeah . And the lights . Where uh are the lights ? Yeah , lights , yeah , there's no Well , there're three , I guess . category . <vocalsound> Nah , there is some money left to be spent . Can we do it wi within two two Euro ? I think we can make a docking station . Yeah . Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? But I mean it isn't <disfmarker> it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated <disfmarker> innovative te technology anyway , I think . Mm-hmm . I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would <disfmarker> wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . But it's original . But what w is there some extra <disfmarker> No , that's true . maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . Instead of the rechargeable <disfmarker> the rechargeable thing was something to um <disfmarker> know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . M bu Maybe we <disfmarker> if we put the kinetic thing in it <disfmarker> But but sometimes you put a <disfmarker> Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I <disfmarker> they will think about that . I mean if you u Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . The uh <disfmarker> it's made for s people <disfmarker> well , the they don't <disfmarker> if it was uh uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility . Uh solar cells are useless . And i it it <disfmarker> th th the the target Or the hand dynamo dynamo <disfmarker> the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Because I think it <disfmarker> when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . Because it's one <disfmarker> it gets thrown around <gap> thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot <disfmarker> Hey that <disfmarker> maybe that's cool <disfmarker> that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . Yeah , but but if we ca I've never seen it before in a remote control . I don't know if <disfmarker> But then we could make a docking station . Five minutes . No , we we we can't make a docking station anyway . That's not true . Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one <disfmarker> We can make a docking station for two thirty . Wow , w why no li we can still make <disfmarker> Look at now , we got two Two thirty . Fo <vocalsound> for a docking station . two thirty left . We can make a docking station . Sure . Ca can't we make a docking station of that ? With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it . Sure . I don't know . The power device is is i i is very cheap . That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . <vocalsound> Wi with a button to Well , we we uh <disfmarker> So . wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . Uh , so it's uh wireless technology . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the <disfmarker> these costs of the speaker and other stuff . I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . <vocalsound> Well then it's a useless project . Look at the case , Oh , because we <gap> <disfmarker> the case the case of of uh of uh <disfmarker> Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things . We <disfmarker> well look at all the special stuff we have . Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . It <disfmarker> th this is whole concept . <vocalsound> Can't we uh <disfmarker> Uh maybe it <disfmarker> with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing . Can't we say fifteen Euros ? <vocalsound> Uh , no . No , sta yeah <gap> I mean <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros . No . No , we only make less profit of it . It's the <disfmarker> You can sell for twenty seven and a half . Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . <vocalsound> No . Yeah , I don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a <disfmarker> Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the <disfmarker> you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . I don't think <disfmarker> Maybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . No . No , that wouldn't n no . Thirteen twenty . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , and it is also not a good <disfmarker> it's not <disfmarker> you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore . And I think only <disfmarker> Yes , but when it's <disfmarker> then when it <disfmarker> Yeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta <disfmarker> No no . then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty . Yeah , it's great . You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No no no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . <vocalsound> When you use it <disfmarker> your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it <disfmarker> You asked for three d No , that's n that's not true . Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time . No . It <disfmarker> We can make it <disfmarker> yeah <disfmarker> no . Becau be but a remote control gets <disfmarker> why do they state that this technology can be used if it Yes , solar cells are also stated . Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells . Why don't we use solar cells then ? Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and <disfmarker> That's true . Yeah , it's funny for a week . I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . <vocalsound> Yeah , but you don't have to . Trust me . The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously . Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what <disfmarker> that would just have a lack of key features , you know . Oui . You m have to put something on your box . You have to make people buy it and uh <disfmarker> We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not <disfmarker> yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out . <vocalsound> You can do it for fifty cents . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , we've got more than fifty Cents . The c <vocalsound> The case the case alone is is is uh Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , because uh we only have a minute left or so . the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro . Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . No no , it's not possible . Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's <disfmarker> this is <disfmarker> then then our concept is ready . Cheap remote control . Yeah , we make some extra profit of it . Yeah . <vocalsound> No , we won't , but that's um something else . But now <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It w it won't tell , but <disfmarker> No , this not gonna sell . No . Huh , any ideas ? Of course not . No , uh , n no Great <gap> . It's great . Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over . Our remote control . We come back tomorrow , okay ? Yeah . <vocalsound> No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . Yes . <gap> the <disfmarker> Seventy Euros . I mean we're gonna <disfmarker> it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel . No , but <disfmarker> no . That's what it's <disfmarker> makes it special . Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and uh I know it will work , but uh it's it's an <disfmarker> They're they're not putting technologies on this <gap> , but if it if it was impossible to to make it happen . Why not a hand dynamo then ? <vocalsound> Okay , well we leave it like this . Then it's c then we're <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . We can't do anything else . Warning , finish meeting now . We're done . Okay , project e uh Is this it ? well , we were gonna what look <disfmarker> take a look at the last sheet . Yeah , <vocalsound> sure . Okay . No , we can't . <vocalsound> Yeah , we have to <disfmarker> Yeah , it's <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . Yes , yes . Celebration . Yes . I don't see why , but <disfmarker> Where's the champagne ? I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . Yeah ? I don't uh hear a bell . No , not yet . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright , I'll see you guys in a minute . We can do it here then . Bye . I don't think so . Can we <disfmarker> can't we do it here ? I don't know . I don't I don't think so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh-huh . Just fill that one in . Yeah , we're doing now . But it's <gap> . Oh , okay . Uh , I don't know . Nice .
Great man . Who starts ? Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . Alright , great . Alright . <vocalsound> Okay . I've put some uh new things in the in the map . Mm-hmm . Uh oh . <vocalsound> This is it . I don't know the shortcut , so <disfmarker> Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . Mm . And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . Yes . Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh <disfmarker> Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . 'Kay . I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? <vocalsound> Well , yeah . Yeah . Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh <disfmarker> I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? No . <vocalsound> No . Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , You're the only one . <vocalsound> Oh . Alright . and I'll have a look if <disfmarker> Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . 'Kay . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh <disfmarker> We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? Uh yeah , I think so . <vocalsound> Alright . Well uh <gap> the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet . <vocalsound> Alright . Um <vocalsound> now I'll look at <gap> show <gap> this board . Um <disfmarker> Well uh notes , first meeting . Now . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , Right . and uh look at their uh remote controls . We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Huh ? Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . <vocalsound> It's uh one of our ideas . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But well I have to do it . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm , now it's right . The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from <gap> , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . <vocalsound> It should be uh recognisable at all times . It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . Yes . Okay . Well fronts were to be <gap> just like mobile telephones . And uh the technical aspects um <disfmarker> And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . Mm-hmm . It's quite logical al all of it . Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . Oh . We will not use teletext . Okay . Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess . Well <disfmarker> the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ Oh . and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . Alright . Oh , alright . Oh , that's a shame . So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . Yeah . But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , Yeah . so we uh have to go on . <vocalsound> Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um <disfmarker> Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Yes . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . Yeah , we are a <vocalsound> real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . I didn't know what company we were , <vocalsound> but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . <vocalsound> Yeah . So it has to be uh a modern design . Okay . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . Yeah . Right . So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . Yeah . Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . Yeah . You want to start ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think I have to start . <vocalsound> Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . <vocalsound> Oh no , no problem . <vocalsound> The order ? No . <vocalsound> Well s then start . Mm . I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . <vocalsound> Okay . Well uh <disfmarker> I think it's this one . But I'm not sure . <gap> <gap> You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . Hmm ? Yeah . S Right . <vocalsound> Yes . This is it . Yeah . Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Mm-hmm . Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . <vocalsound> Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target <vocalsound> audience or our target product users , customers . Well , <vocalsound> um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . <vocalsound> That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um <disfmarker> They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control . <vocalsound> Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it's uh <vocalsound> seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . <vocalsound> You can zap away . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah right . Yeah . Right . A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their <vocalsound> in their living room . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I dunno , maybe that's an idea . 'Cause it's uh a big <disfmarker> I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . Oh . <vocalsound> Oh ? <vocalsound> Yeah . It should actually uh <disfmarker> It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? No you can click it on your television . Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? <vocalsound> Yeah in another room , yeah . <vocalsound> Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room . Well yes . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Well a beeping device would be <disfmarker> Well we'll have a look at it , yeah . Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . <vocalsound> I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah but people don't read manuals . I didn't read it ? Oh , alright . No . No . <gap> users to uh add one ? Do you think ? I don't think <disfmarker> I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yes you should <disfmarker> You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work . <vocalsound> Yeah alright . Yep . Because they don't use it ? Alright . Yeah . Right . Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short . And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . Yes okay . Well maybe for the <disfmarker> If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ? Alright . Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only <disfmarker> <gap> And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than <disfmarker> I think . Well we are a design team , Hmm . we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . Yeah right , right . <vocalsound> Isn't it part of the of the u <vocalsound> So No . No . Never mind . Well we'll have a look . Next point . Um R_S_I_ . Um yes ? <vocalsound> Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh <vocalsound> should uh <disfmarker> Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . Consider the m It should be a good in your hand . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yep . Right , this is the most important part . Um , we're <disfmarker> Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . Um , <vocalsound> that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh <disfmarker> I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . Well <disfmarker> So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh <disfmarker> It's going to be expensive . Yeah . No . Yeah but <vocalsound> they think it's really important . So if we want to s Yeah . If we have a big <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh <disfmarker> Well we'll uh consider it uh . Well <disfmarker> Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh <disfmarker> We'll think abo we'll think <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't know . I don't have any information on that . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nigh <vocalsound> No , we'll look we'll look into that later . I know . <vocalsound> Right . Alright ? And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , but research is very uh costly . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think that's uh difficult to realise also . Yeah , but <vocalsound> it <vocalsound> it might be important for the sale . We have very demanding clients . It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . We sh Yeah absolutely . Yeah . So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . <vocalsound> No . Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . Alright . Yep . We don't rule them out uh yet . <gap> 'Kay . Alright . Um , I think that's it . Um <disfmarker> Alright . I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . Yes . So you can <disfmarker> Right . Well you <disfmarker> I c I can uh still see your presentation . Yeah . Right . It's in the <disfmarker> Well uh next um I dunno who is next . Shall I give a technical talk ? Oh you go . Yes . Alright . Well go ahead . <vocalsound> Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . Yip . <vocalsound> We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the <disfmarker> F_ five . F_ F_ five . <vocalsound> F_ five . Yep . Alright . Well , the working design , <vocalsound> that's my uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Next button . <vocalsound> Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white Oh right . but it became black and purple . Purple <vocalsound> . But I think you can read it . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit . Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh <disfmarker> Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . <gap> And I then can select I can select on the dings <gap> <gap> the p the whole picture . It goes to the next page . Nah , uh never mind . Click . <vocalsound> Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult . Yeah , go ahead . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . Yeah . Alright . And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um <vocalsound> uh the <vocalsound> the <gap> the buttons of course . <vocalsound> And the <vocalsound> the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea . Yep . Very basic . <vocalsound> Um well I have uh <vocalsound> uh <vocalsound> put it in a in in in a <vocalsound> a couple of basic steps . <vocalsound> Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . The key <gap> a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . <vocalsound> uh and recognise the key . So <vocalsound> well you understand . <vocalsound> The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . <vocalsound> Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , Yeah . <vocalsound> and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the <vocalsound> the signal , and performs the assigned task . So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So <disfmarker> Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Uh we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No no , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . <vocalsound> I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh <gap> if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but <disfmarker> This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But it it uh it's it's quite um <disfmarker> Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um uh not very high-tech uh High tech . <vocalsound> indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . Right . Can I say something ? Yeah . Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons Right . and you can immediately <disfmarker> Make them big , make them easy to uh to press . Well but but <vocalsound> You don't have to look and and search for them . You can also like <disfmarker> if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . Right . Yeah , right . Right . Yeah , I was thinking you can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , <vocalsound> and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . Yeah , that's right . Are some of the the the um <disfmarker> That's right . That's right . Well you you can't have any uh every button <vocalsound> under the thumb , of course . We No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . But <disfmarker> Yeah . That's very important . And <disfmarker> Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . But is that is that useable ? Hmm ? Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? <vocalsound> It's a f it's a new feature , Well <disfmarker> Well it it's <disfmarker> you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . Yeah . Yeah alright , but <disfmarker> Yeah , Well also i if someone puts <vocalsound> picks up his uh remote <disfmarker> but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it <gap> , I think . Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . Eighty per cent would . Well , <gap> . Yeah , he feels it immediately . Yeah that's true . That's very irritating , I think . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . Yeah but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Right , continue . Sorry . <vocalsound> But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time . Well it's uh pretty pretty <vocalsound> basically uh as you said . Yep . And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you . Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's right . <vocalsound> That's your part of the job . <vocalsound> So yeah <gap> exactly <gap> this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . Yep . And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new <disfmarker> Alright . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> But I had too too little time , but uh don't uh don't look at it please . <vocalsound> Well we understand . Alright . I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . We understand . Yeah , it's clear . Alright . Oh right , no . That's the most important thing . Nice . Alright . Uh <disfmarker> Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . How late is did we start his presentation uh ? <gap> Right . <vocalsound> I dunno . I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? Wha Yeah . Well then we have still the time , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Losing time losing time . <vocalsound> But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . Yeah right . So <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> <gap> Well I thought um everybody on the website <vocalsound> uh would see the same thing , but obviously <vocalsound> that's not the case . I don't think so . Yeah , uh there are different uh <disfmarker> We have all have different home pages , with different links . Oh yeah ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah right . Uh ? For instance you couldn't see this . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , yeah well . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Well I'm Mike <gap> , User Interface Designer . Mm-hmm . The the method ? Well <disfmarker> I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> These are already in use ? Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Alright , okay . Um <disfmarker> This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> I like user-centred . Yeah , me too . I like user-centr centred uh <vocalsound> uh also the best . <vocalsound> Yeah . We also do that . Um <disfmarker> Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . Mm . Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? But <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . <vocalsound> Alright . Um <disfmarker> I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need . <vocalsound> I um I kinda like the shape . Yeah , right . <vocalsound> I think this is what we talked about . But <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . But I think uh <disfmarker> No I've <disfmarker> Well I showed it somewhere . Um <disfmarker> Uh you can draw it if you <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . So we can can uh yeah customise the <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh make someone w Mm ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It's a front . It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . But it <disfmarker> You can <disfmarker> So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . Mm . Yeah , that's right Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . Yeah , that's a must . So l like Ericsson does <gap> every uh <disfmarker> We must have that . Yeah , we must . We can put it on the on the back side . Yeah well and and <disfmarker> S something like this . <vocalsound> Yes . It's recognisable . 'Kay . We can make a symbol of the company right here . Um <disfmarker> And <vocalsound> if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on Yeah ? Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah . Yeah yeah . Something like that , Yeah yeah yeah . in the <disfmarker> Yeah . Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . But let's not focus on the front <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Those kind of things . Yes . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we don't . So um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . Alright . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . Maybe some less . Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . I think uh <disfmarker> Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . <vocalsound> The less buttons the better the design . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , I agree . We should go with that concept I think . I know . Alright . I've I've got another point . Yeah ? Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . Mm . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . The younger uh <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> The younger audience . Mm-hmm . So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . Well what if we um <disfmarker> I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , Mm-hmm . and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh <disfmarker> You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do . Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh Clip aren't used much . <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> No um mm usually <disfmarker> Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , Yeah right . But <disfmarker> but not <disfmarker> Yeah , but what kind of features ? Yeah I think <vocalsound> m most <disfmarker> Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . Yeah but <disfmarker> Yeah . But I've <disfmarker> Most uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Uh . You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . <vocalsound> Competitors . <vocalsound> Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah . <vocalsound> The concurrent ? <vocalsound> Competitors , right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , I do think we have to uh have some features . Yeah . Even though they cost a little more . Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , Right . Right . or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Like a ticker-tape . Yeah . Which programme you are l watching or something . Yeah , that's nice . <vocalsound> Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . Yeah , right . Yeah right . Yeah . Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , Yeah . uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . <vocalsound> For example . It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . Yeah , we should keep that simple too . But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh <vocalsound> It will <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . No not clickable . Well maybe . No , it should be uh integrated . Nah , no no no . or <vocalsound> or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s <vocalsound> you sit like this you can can watch . I think it should be at the top . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , something like on um some radios in car . You <disfmarker> Where it's , yeah , walking to <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea . R_D_S_s or something . But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and <vocalsound> that kind of thing . Wa Yeah . Well it's just one script . <vocalsound> Well I think it's you got <disfmarker> It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , and it's not uh <disfmarker> That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh <disfmarker> Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . <vocalsound> Yeah . So I don't think that's the issue . No . Alright . Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? Uh well I think so , yes . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . 'Kay . Right , I don't know if I can find that , but <disfmarker> We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that . Or maybe you will get that information uh <disfmarker> Next time . Um we can use this board again , I think . Yeah right . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . <vocalsound> Where is my presentation ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I understand what you're saying . <gap> Uh <disfmarker> We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . Well <disfmarker> I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . Right . So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . At the top . Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? At the top or at the bottom ? Yes . The L_C_D_ screen alright <gap> I think the top is more uh <disfmarker> but we should start with the power button ? Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . When you s How do you zap ? Yeah but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You just sit in your chair ? <vocalsound> Huh ? With the remote ? Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . That thing is terrible . 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . <vocalsound> Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I dunno . Yeah , no Mm . And then uh <disfmarker> We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . <vocalsound> I dunno what uh you were talking about but <disfmarker> No <vocalsound> Um he thinks <disfmarker> <gap> we are busy with something <gap> . Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top . Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? Well <disfmarker> Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . But your <disfmarker> But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , I c so that there's room for the for the interface . Yeah . Well I d I think that's that's ugly but <disfmarker> The the ticker <disfmarker> The L_C_D_ is like like small . <vocalsound> It's it's wide . It's not not high . But <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh-huh . <vocalsound> I th Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , And and we can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . Yeah . Power button always <disfmarker> Yeah . Bottom . Yeah . So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or <vocalsound> you want to <disfmarker> Yeah . So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window <disfmarker> Yeah right . But <disfmarker> We're making a remote with <vocalsound> with a few functions you know . Well <vocalsound> that's <vocalsound> a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you <gap> . It's it's also more recognisable . We It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes but we we we we don't want that . Yeah you don't want <disfmarker> We don't want them to look like a calculator . You want uh <disfmarker> Yeah it it it must be a remote . We want to look it like our original but familiar <disfmarker> Yeah w well , but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe <vocalsound> important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , Yeah . High-tech <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yea uh because <vocalsound> I think it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We White ? <vocalsound> I think it's still important to have it at the top , Width . Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? because it's uh it's more familiar that way . <gap> Th that's not a problem . Yeah ? <vocalsound> When I draw here it <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Oh . Huh ? It's a bit off . Yeah , it's off . <vocalsound> A little a little bit . Well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It <vocalsound> it needs to be calibrated again . Well <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe you should another pen . <vocalsound> Maybe that's uh better . <gap> You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah . Where ? <vocalsound> Alright , we have to make a decision now , It's special pen . because we don't have much time . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . No . I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . Yeah . I I agree . I think it should be at the button , bottom . Well I'm the <vocalsound> I I'm the designer , so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> At the bottom ? Bottom . The L_C_D_ . <vocalsound> In a few minutes <disfmarker> At the bot Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah . Yeah . So <disfmarker> We are two uh V_S_ two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , He's the boss . <vocalsound> Yeah . and then look at the design . Right . Great . Uh we uh we were busy with that . Because we have to decide this . Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . Yeah . So , we have the power button . And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . Yes . It's uh your it's your job . <vocalsound> Yeah of course . <vocalsound> Well we have a power button . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh No it's our job . Guys ? While you have to agree , I can say <gap> it's like this and <vocalsound> you must agree . Yeah . For all of us I think . <vocalsound> Yeah , right . Guys ? Alright , let's keep it central . <vocalsound> We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The ten numbers ? Yeah ? Channel , yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Volume ? Volume control . Yes . Um <disfmarker> Mm . Uh the mute button . Well let's look at your uh design . Uh <disfmarker> I h love that one . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . I think we we should use something like this um to um <disfmarker> The the channel up and channel down button ? <vocalsound> Yeah , in circle , you know ? Yes . Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that's that's also design . And and a volume control also in it . Yes . Right . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> Yeah . Well h ho But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So <disfmarker> Yes . Yes . Yes , They are for some uh video uh <disfmarker> as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . <vocalsound> You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . Yeah . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was <vocalsound> t kinda true . When <gap> <vocalsound> when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , <vocalsound> and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . Apart . So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . <gap> Y <gap> That's what I always do , <vocalsound> because all my i important buttons are the same place . Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . Um <disfmarker> Yes ? They they need to be centred . No but now y Well not <disfmarker> W would we have to choose a way in middle ? Frequency of uh button use . Yes . Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Volume hardly . Uh-huh . So the the <vocalsound> channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . No I don't think . <vocalsound> Oh . Up and down far apart from each other ? Far apart ? <gap> <vocalsound> You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ? Yeah but <disfmarker> Yeah but <disfmarker> Well not too much . <vocalsound> Y look at uh look at the frequency . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nei not too much , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So <disfmarker> I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . Well for example the power button , you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well they are used four times an hour , so <disfmarker> If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone <disfmarker> But the buttons is way . Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . So that one can be put away . But just <disfmarker> Yeah . Right . Yeah . I agree . The power button can uh be uh uh <disfmarker> Power bu button should be left at the top . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . And should and should be red . Yeah . Oh man , five minutes . <vocalsound> Yeah , well five minutes left . Right , just make some decisions . Yep . The most important things we have to uh <disfmarker> Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? C c can you make you make <disfmarker> We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but <disfmarker> But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . Well I have it here . I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . Just uh you decide that , Mm . Yeah . Yes . you decide that , Mm . Alright . and <vocalsound> ready . Yes . Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . <vocalsound> Yeah . But you will have to make consensus with <gap> . Well <disfmarker> Well consensus , um <disfmarker> We we can put it in the middle , so <disfmarker> Well it's a bit hard , Nei . We're <disfmarker> No <disfmarker> <vocalsound> because we are going to be uh individually . That's a bit uh <disfmarker> We're deciding now , so <disfmarker> Yes . Top or bottom ? Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so Yes it is . <disfmarker> Yeah . You say familiarity isn't important but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? Okay . Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? Yeah d Yeah , right . Okay . Yeah . Alright . Alright these functions . As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . The number f Well yes , that's alright . So that's that's enough . Yeah . Yeah , okay . W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? No . How do you want it to do then ? There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . Well just when you push a one one and <disfmarker> It it has to r recognise one as <vocalsound> there could still come more . No , <vocalsound> if you <disfmarker> Oh , like that . On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , <vocalsound> d it <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yes . They'd recognise it . Yeah . Th that's the most <disfmarker> Alright so no button for that . Yeah . That that's very easy . Yeah . Yeah . No . Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? I think these are the the most important functions . Do you still have the pictures over there ? Yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah , that's about it . You do need the uh multi Or did uh <disfmarker> No , like this one . You do need them ? No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I know . But are we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright , alright uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Now okay . <vocalsound> Well uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . Right . So just for a television is that all we need ? Yeah , it's most useable this way . <gap> basic function . Yeah . Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that <vocalsound> ar are to do with teletext <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh screen placing . We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh <disfmarker> And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . <vocalsound> Uh there's um <vocalsound> screen . You can make it wider and less wide . Yeah . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . Right . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . Oh yeah . Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ? Uh just two just two under uh under uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Th that's a bit uh waste . We we can make <vocalsound> make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . Yes . Yeah . Okay , right . I I think uh <disfmarker> Or at the top . <vocalsound> Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . <vocalsound> Or at <disfmarker> But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . Yeah alright then . Uh that's that's too complicated . Yes . You can just put it somewhere <disfmarker> They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , Yeah so you can put it somewhere <disfmarker> Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ? Above or down ? Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah . Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh <disfmarker> Well if you <vocalsound> you take those th If you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Why go to video ? Go to video , that's always on your remote control . Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh <disfmarker> To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ . The the video channel uh ? That's just zero . Yeah . Well l n no not at not at my remote . No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , but you can can zap down <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . Yes . Yes , I think th I don't . I go to ninety-nine . <vocalsound> No , then you press ninety nine . Ah uh well whatever , <vocalsound> . I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but <disfmarker> Th that's the button uh <disfmarker> No . But it's easy to go <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . No you can ch push zero . It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . Yeah . Yeah , I I think that one button is uh <disfmarker> I use it uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , <vocalsound> if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . Yeah ? Right all th these uh different buttons you have to <disfmarker> These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . Ah , I do . <vocalsound> Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk <vocalsound> It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those <disfmarker> Yeah well y you must have . Yeah y you you you you have screen width . Yeah you yeah you have one one button from <vocalsound> s set frequency o or something , <vocalsound> and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh <disfmarker> Right . That's the only one we put uh in there . So we still <gap> have one uh four ? For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . Ch ch Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the <disfmarker> Yeah . Programme , right . Okay . Oh the Okay button ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Yeah . Yeah , alright . Menu button . You should <disfmarker> Yeah . I think that's important . Uh <disfmarker> <gap> And and the settings to change the brightness <vocalsound> Channel , setting , menu . <gap> We have to go . <vocalsound> the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . <vocalsound> Okay . Channel , yeah . <gap> So um Save . Chief ? Chief ? Yes see . Th the menu menu button is also important . Then you can uh <disfmarker> Yes I have put it in . Where ? <vocalsound> I don't see it . Here . Oh Menu , alright . <vocalsound> I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . Yeah , the <disfmarker> Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . Alright . Or the volume or something like that . Guys ? Yeah . Or the volume , yeah . We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So <disfmarker> Your pen . Ah . Great . Yes chief . <vocalsound> Alright . I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? Well see you uh <disfmarker> Yeah this is this is your thing . W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh <disfmarker> Ah . Okay . <gap> Yeah , lunch break . I am hungry . <vocalsound> Lunch . <vocalsound> Get into my belly . <vocalsound> Ah . We didn't exactly do everything but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <gap> <vocalsound> See you later mate . <vocalsound>
Well hi everyone again . Hello . Hello . Hello Um <vocalsound> like before we uh <disfmarker> I have to redo the meetings from <vocalsound> <disfmarker> n th the minutes from the last meeting Mm-hmm . and so here we go . Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um Designer . <vocalsound> designer <vocalsound> that uh looks would be very important on this new remote <vocalsound> and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . Um . <vocalsound> Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> And she was challenged on that point <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> that's right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . The industrial designer um presented her uh <vocalsound> thoughts on the issue . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . Uh and of course a circuit board . And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse <disfmarker> morse code related relays the <disfmarker> uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build Okay . and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . She would like uh <disfmarker> this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with <disfmarker> to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . She feels that's really what people want today . And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes <disfmarker> from the last meeting . Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . Yeah . Yeah . Just the look like , the button part I'll explain . Yeah . Uh so this is our <disfmarker> what uh we have made . This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . Mm-hmm . Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive Mm-hmm . um and it's <disfmarker> it's blue in colour Mm-hmm . uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons Mm-hmm . so it is a <disfmarker> uh uh a <disfmarker> looks-wise it is beautiful . Mm-hmm . Uh and also compact in shape . Mm-hmm . Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into <disfmarker> into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Good . Yeah , oops , sorry . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You used to have all the buttons <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the <disfmarker> Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als Oh that's good , yeah . no , that's nice and friendly . Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . Mm-hmm . Mm . Mm-hmm , Mm-hmm . mm-hmm . And then um uh for the <disfmarker> for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green Mm-hmm . and it's a <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . Mm-hmm . And <disfmarker> and the button <disfmarker> button's part uh will be explained by F Francina . Okay . Okay . Now the um <disfmarker> we decided upon including certain features on our remote . Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal <disfmarker> it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . Yeah , okay , mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Now uh we have included the switch on and off button . Mm-hmm . Now we have included another feature that is the mute button Mm-hmm . on the side of the model . Mm-hmm . Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes <disfmarker> the different channels . Mm-hmm . We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . Mm-hmm . And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . Mm . Now our <disfmarker> our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . What kind of button ? Menu button . Menu ? Uh menu th menu , uh one one . Yes , menu <disfmarker> Menu button . <vocalsound> At the centre Mm-hmm . we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness Mm-hmm . Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm . of this uh picture . We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button . The next channel in the numeric pattern , or <disfmarker> No , swapping is if if example you're <disfmarker> you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . Yeah , mm-hmm . Mm . Okay , okay . Yes . And at the end , it <disfmarker> this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So this is our proposed model . Okay . Mm-hmm . Now the marketing expert has to Tell , yeah . give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable <vocalsound> or it'll be cost effective . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , well um what <disfmarker> what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , Yes , yes . that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands Mm-hmm . and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? Yes the buttons are all raised , right ? The buttons are all raised Yes . Are raised , mm-hmm . and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , Right . Or have two hands to operate it , yeah . I really like that . You really did a good job on that , my little designers . Mm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . That's that's a really good good thing . Yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really <disfmarker> Yeah , that's great . you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah , mm-hmm . Hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Abs okay . The colour's very attractive . Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute No , these <disfmarker> the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . and <disfmarker> these <disfmarker> mm-hmm On both sides they're mute ? Yes , yes . So you can push either one ? Yes . Okay . So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . And this brings the menu up on the screen ? <vocalsound> Pardon me ? This brings the menu up on the screen This is the menu <disfmarker> yes , yes . and the orange ones are <disfmarker> A the <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> these <disfmarker> these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , Okay . and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels . F f okay . Right , very good . Scroll up or scroll down the channels . Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay and now I'm supposed to <disfmarker> Well , I have one question yeah . uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? Yes , it will have uh <disfmarker> these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . Ah . Yeah , definitely . Will have symbols so that that <disfmarker> that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it <disfmarker> Yes , which can be easily recognised . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yes . Yeah . Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . Yes . Yeah of course , and also <disfmarker> Yes . Hmm . Yeah . Yeah . But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn Yes . Yeah we can <disfmarker> Symbols on it . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Text . Yes . Text that we can have on the case itself , we can <disfmarker> Yes . That's right . it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . And <disfmarker> and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . Mm , 'kay , mm . Mm-hmm . A shell shape . For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , Right , mm-hmm . Yes , yes . Yeah . <vocalsound> we have the snail shell . So it is <disfmarker> Yes , snail shell . Mm-hmm . yeah , He goes right back into his shell . yeah <disfmarker> shell . Yes . Right . Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow Mm-hmm . and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that Mm-hmm . Mm . <vocalsound> Y Yes <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , of course , yeah . you know that would , that would really work . Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? So <disfmarker> That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual <disfmarker> I think voice recognition is our big selling point Mm . 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . Mm-hmm . Mm . And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . Yep uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . You know . I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . Colours . Mm-hmm . We're really gonna have the be the Cutest . cutest remote control on the block . Mm . Yeah . So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition . I think those are the two things to push . Mm-hmm . The look and the voice recognition . They're gonna be our two selling points . Okay , now uh having said that <disfmarker> I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ? No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . Okay . Now we're gonna talk about financing . Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , there is a production evaluation . No ? Is that you ? Yeah , that's me . But that's after the financing . Oh , okay . See ? Fi see ? Sorry , sorry . Mm-mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> Okay , we had looks and voice recognition . Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . Okay uh energy source we say that's battery , right ? Mm . That's right . Okay , now . So we <disfmarker> I guess we use one . Yeah . Yes . What ? T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . Well , that's nice . She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would <disfmarker> It doesn't work . Hmm . Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or <disfmarker> Oh , okay yeah , okay , Yeah . let's see . Okay , one , okay . Yes . Oh go away . Um kinetic source so that's <disfmarker> in the energy source that's all we need . Mm-hmm . Uh electronics , simple chip on print ? Is that's what we're using ? Yeah , Yes . yeah . One of those ? Come on . Okay , one . Uh regular chip on print . No . No . That's all we need , the one Yeah . <disfmarker> case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . Well . <vocalsound> This is a <disfmarker> Single curve ? Mm . I guess it's double curved . Double curved ? One of those ? Mm-hmm . Case materi s supplements . Plastic we said , Yeah . right ? Plastic . Uh wood , rubber ? Rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons . Yeah . Uh but , yes but <disfmarker> I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh <disfmarker> yeah case material . That's just for the case material , Is this for the case ? Yes . so special colours though , we having that , Oh okay , the mm-hmm , mm' kay . right ? Mm-hmm . Yes . Mm-hmm . And then we have to interface push buttons . Yes . Mm-hmm . Scroll wheel , no . Integrated scroll wheel , L_C_ display ? No , No . 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , Button . right ? No . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Uh , button supplement special colour ? Speci Yes Special form ? Yes d we do have special form . Yes . And special material , rubber , wood , yes . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> Total seven point six whatever that means . Uh , I think that's the price . That's the price . One two three four five six seven eight nine Maybe it <disfmarker> is it just <disfmarker> n Mm ? Eight , eight point two . Nine points , That's <disfmarker> hmm ? okay , yes . Eight point two , right ? So , we <disfmarker> looks like we are well within budget . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . I guess I should save this I suppose , huh ? Yeah . Oops . Uh-huh huh huh . On the desktop . I just tried that . My documents , computer . AMI . My compu Ah oh here it is , yes . AMI should for Okay , fine . Save . Okay good , so that's the good news . We gonna be popular . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . So that uh <disfmarker> I think financing was pretty simple . Mm-hmm . Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up . 'Kay should be able to get it now . 'Kay , why don't you move just to the next slide right away . You wanna go to the next slide ? Yeah right away . Okay . Okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that <disfmarker> maybe little things we haven't thought of . Okay . Mm-hmm . We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . Yeah . And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . Mm-hmm . Mm . So we have to get some input from those people . Mm-hmm . And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . Um , next slide please . Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . The size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons Mm-hmm . and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . Fee selling . Yeah . They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . Yeah . Yes . Um so they'll be our main selling points . So um <vocalsound> th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . Okay , so um the shape um I think is a <disfmarker> a one . That's really , really excellent shape . The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's <disfmarker> I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right <disfmarker> the scale is one to seven . I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . Okay . And our colour I think is great . The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um I just realised one thing . Yes . In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . Yes . Ah . Yeah . And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? Eight , eight twenty , yes . Eight twenty so <disfmarker> And so we've got <disfmarker> we've still got four euros to go <disfmarker> to spend . We have um four euros , yeah I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean <vocalsound> four thirty . Mm-hmm . Well um that's <disfmarker> But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . Mm-hmm . So um we just have to beware of that . I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah <gap> . So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . Yeah , Yes , yeah . yes . And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . Yeah , still . Yeah . <vocalsound> As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no <disfmarker> that that was not um included uh <disfmarker> that there was no room for any special features , okay ? Included , yeah . Hmm , hmm Yeah mm . So to beware of that . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? Uh , well I isn't this my last slide ? Maybe . I dunno . Go ahead . Yes it is . Mm-hmm . I think that was my last slide , yeah . Um . Mm okay . And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . Oh . I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that , um . Why ? Wh why you need that up ? Hmm ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here . I think you can make it there . Mm 'kay . You ready . So now we're all supposed to say what we think . Um okay so on shape I gave it a one . Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst . Worse , okay . Um what do you think the shape is ? One . One , okay , and Be Betsy ? Yes I think uh shape is one . Yeah , even my <disfmarker> yeah , shape is one . Okay , uh-huh one , okay . And how about on size ? On size <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> you gave it a four . I gave it a four , yeah , I feel it's just average . Um , I dunno . I think I would give it at least a two . Okay . One . Mm-hmm . Yeah , even I think it is one . Okay . It's quite small . Okay <vocalsound> <vocalsound> you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um and then how about <disfmarker> how we doing on colour ? Colour uh I <disfmarker> Colour , I gave it a one . One . I really like all those nice bright , warm colours . I <disfmarker> I like the colours . One . One . One . Yes . Yeah , one . One , one , one , okay . And how about the feel ? Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand . Uh , I think I would give it a two . Okay , I gave it a three , two , I'll give three . yeah ? Three . Uh maybe two , Two , okay . yeah . And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but <disfmarker> Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more <disfmarker> is <disfmarker> are more tangible so from that point of view Yeah . Mm-hmm . but um <disfmarker> I'll give it a three . Okay . Two . Two , okay . Uh three , Three ? mm-hmm . Okay . Well , um . It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But um otherwise I think we're <disfmarker> we're ready to go to <disfmarker> go with this product . Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? Uh . Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . Um . Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? Maybe we can <disfmarker> We can always improve , yes . yeah , include some more buttons and uh um Yes , features . yeah features . We can make the buttons <disfmarker> few buttons smaller . Uh I think they are quite big , so I think <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that . Mm-hmm . Well then again if we're gonna um <vocalsound> do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . Yeah . Yeah , definitely . Yes . Voices . Mm-hmm . So that that's where we're gonna have to do <disfmarker> maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons . Yes . Yes . And um then maybe we can do something with the um the volume control . Maybe we can put that all on one button . Hmm . Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . Mm-hmm . Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget And maybe <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things . No . Uh um we need uh <disfmarker> you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Um . Mm-hmm . So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? Uh I think <disfmarker> personally I think uh I'm pretty happy . I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um , Even I'm happy . Um an it's something I think I can market . Yeah . Yeah . and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? <vocalsound> I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Yes , yes you've done a good job . Yeah , yeah , definitely . <vocalsound> And I think team work I think was very very good , Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah . Mm-hmm . I think we really <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And uh I think we <disfmarker> are we happy with the means we used ? We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things . Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , Whiteboard more , yes , yes . Yeah , probably . we didn't use that enough . Yes , we could . Uh , it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody Mm-hmm . and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . And we used the slide because it was better positioned . Yes . <vocalsound> Yes , I think so , I think absolutely , Yeah . No . Mm I think that's true mm-hmm . and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . Hmm . Yes . Mm-hmm . Um did we new <disfmarker> did we find new ideas ? I think we did . Yeah , many . I think we were we were very good , yeah , mm . I think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here . Mm-hmm . Okay . Are the costs within budget ? Yes , yes . Uh is the project evaluated ? Yes , yes . Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um then celebration . <vocalsound> Celebration . Cel celebration <vocalsound> yes , yes . <vocalsound> Ah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I <disfmarker> I thank you all very much . Um , I think this was very good Mm-hmm . and um Yeah . I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible . Mm-hmm . Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view . Mm-hmm . So , thank you . Okay . Yeah . Thank you . Thank you very much . Okay . Watch I I have my cord behind you here . Okay . Okay . I always get it on here , but getting it off is <disfmarker> Do we <disfmarker> do we have some time left ? Uh <disfmarker> you have <disfmarker> They say it's forty minutes . Ah yes we have time later But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . but we don't <disfmarker> Okay . Oh , alright . It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . <vocalsound> Oh , there we go .
<vocalsound> Okay . Oh I totally <disfmarker> Yeah 'cause I moved it . <vocalsound> 'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it . <vocalsound> Ready for this ? All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> . which is kind of fun . <vocalsound> Oh man . <vocalsound> So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my <disfmarker> that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . Oh really ? Okay . I think . <vocalsound> Huh . I don't know . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary and I'm <disfmarker> therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um <vocalsound> just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . <vocalsound> Yeah that's not you . <vocalsound> No . That's how the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wait . <vocalsound> This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh <disfmarker> last meeting was that <vocalsound> um we that we had meetings from <disfmarker> uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we're operating with um <disfmarker> uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some <disfmarker> mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . <vocalsound> So . That's sorted , back to the main <vocalsound> meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys . Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see Mm-hmm . and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , <vocalsound> Ah . <vocalsound> Nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> why not ? <vocalsound> Fair enough . <vocalsound> Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um . <vocalsound> Perfect . No Go ahead . it's important to <vocalsound> we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces Mm . and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity Right . if you will . <vocalsound> Appropriate , okay . Um . Right , um , of course that's uh interchangeable <vocalsound> and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued Mm 'kay . but this is kind of something that can be done It is an option . um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . <vocalsound> Oh , right . That's this here . <vocalsound> Ah . I see . Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , <vocalsound> um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . <vocalsound> Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ? Um I worried about the materials , it is uh <disfmarker> the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok Nice . I thought that was kinda nice . This was actually an apple on the inside . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? <vocalsound> This <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> it's encased in a new uh type of uh Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , polymer Yeah . we don't need to worry , <vocalsound> yeah . It's fine . We got a bit ahead of ourselves , okay . I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but <disfmarker> Hmm . Fair enough . <vocalsound> Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . <vocalsound> No but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's a couple years off at least . It's pos a possible new product . Okay . Um , but I think that's <disfmarker> I think that sums up the main features of our <disfmarker> of the remote , um I dunno if you guys have any questions Brilliant . Right . or f whether that uh <disfmarker> whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ? Uh we did , yeah . This cost <disfmarker> well to put this into um production , we're looking at about <disfmarker> what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . <vocalsound> Um , so I was quite pleased with that . Mm-hmm . One thing that we didn't do um <disfmarker> obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button Mm . and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . Brilliant . So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , Mm . in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote Okay . and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . Mm . <vocalsound> Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? And <disfmarker> Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console <vocalsound> Okay . and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . Yeah . Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier Mm 'kay . and um , I think that uh has given a proven um <vocalsound> ease of use and what not . Hmm . Yeah . And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . Right . Cool . Any questions ? <vocalsound> Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? No , no I think that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? Um , do you wanna answer this one Do we know where we stand on that yet ? or do you want me to answer it ? Well we didn't quite have enough material uh <vocalsound> . Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype Yeah , yeah . I just didn't know <disfmarker> if you guys had any in mind yet . <vocalsound> Oh I see , right , um . Um , well <vocalsound> as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like <disfmarker> Okay . Just veneer really , yeah . Okay . Right . Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips Mm-hmm . and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . And the whole thing <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay Right So I mean there are <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> we definitely priced out a spongy <disfmarker> even spongier non-natural look um materials Yeah . There's <disfmarker> Okay . which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . Mm 'kay . Okay , very cool . It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate Okay . because it's simple enough that in the factory it could <disfmarker> we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way Okay . if you know what I mean . Yep . It's still an option if we need it . Yeah . Very cool , nice job . Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant . <vocalsound> Um , <vocalsound> what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me <disfmarker> you've got <disfmarker> you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Oh . Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts <vocalsound> and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . Ooh . I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like <disfmarker> So we'll just <disfmarker> if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this <disfmarker> it's a solar cell thing right ? Right uh we didn't really touch on that With a back-up battery ? but it it's in there , yep . With the ba okay . Um and <disfmarker> The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah . Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? Yeah , yeah . It's just making use of the same space and the same materials , Mm-hmm . Okay . Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that <disfmarker> be the general <disfmarker> Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? Yeah , mm-hmm . Um . And um a special <disfmarker> I guess it's uh <disfmarker> we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that <disfmarker> throughout , Yeah , special . yeah . And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , <vocalsound> Yeah , it's it's quite unique . I like to think of it as unconventional . I like it , yeah it's <disfmarker> So it looks like M come in at sixteen ? a bit over budget , um . Oh . Huh , doesn't match up <vocalsound> does it ? <vocalsound> So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells <vocalsound> um or take out the back-up battery . Uh <disfmarker> How do you feel about that ? I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that <disfmarker> you know what the sell is on that . Yeah . I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working <vocalsound> what am I gonna do ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm k . People'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , True . it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . Hmm . <vocalsound> What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , Nah . it would have to be <disfmarker> seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way . Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental <disfmarker> I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . Hmm . I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean <disfmarker> I mean that's what sets us apart Which , it's <disfmarker> right ? yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , Right . but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here Right . Yeah . and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here Right . It's either or . Yeah . and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . I think unfortunately that's our best option . It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? Mm . Of twelve fifty . 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It <disfmarker> kind of <disfmarker> Yeah , <vocalsound> . um and we can't get rid of the uh <disfmarker> I mean removing the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Savings . yeah . changing the case wouldn't be so much of a <vocalsound> mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials . Mm-mm . Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . Yeah . So that would be the <disfmarker> it's a major change but <disfmarker> Yeah . Gotta do what you gotta do . Alright , so we're in agreement on that . Unfortunately I think we are . No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . <vocalsound> Right . Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . That would be me . Um cord ? Ah of course , sorry . No problem . Whoosh . Can you reach , that would be great , Yep . thank you . <vocalsound> That'd be great <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I didn't even do that one on purpose either , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um <vocalsound> from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of <disfmarker> these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . Mm . Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . <vocalsound> Really good . So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . <vocalsound> So . They like that spongy feel . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It looks like it's going over well , so And the paging function works well , Six ? that's good to hear , we're we're good yeah . we worked hard on that one . We did . Yeah . <vocalsound> Brilliant . It's <disfmarker> I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good . I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel That's everything from me . <vocalsound> Hmm . but it's okay . Yeah . Mm . Yeah , it is a set-back , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , do you need the cord back ? W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again Um yeah , I was just <disfmarker> go on . that we're <disfmarker> I know . Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ? I guess that's true . True . Right . So , um , <vocalsound> this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um <vocalsound> our project process um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um <vocalsound> uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um . Okay . As in within the team or ? I think so yeah . Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or <disfmarker> Okay . I think it's <disfmarker> I mm-hmm , I think so . 'Kay . I think <vocalsound> hope I'm not screwing up an experiment <vocalsound> . It is now , you're in charge <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so there you go <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay <vocalsound> fair enough . Yeah . Whatever <vocalsound> . Um right , um so any thoughts ? Are we considering these points here ? Um . Yeah . Okay . I think they're starting blocks yeah . What do you guys feel about the process ? <gap> Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were <vocalsound> relatively productive , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . We didn't use the whiteboard at all . <vocalsound> No , we didn't . No . No , no whiteboard . <vocalsound> We could now if that'd make up for it <vocalsound> And <disfmarker> but really <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . Yeah I think I was taking <vocalsound> notes more often than usual just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah . Yeah , it's true . Uh . Mm . Was pretty cool tack though . Yeah . Mm . Definitely . I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> As you write your personal coach . <vocalsound> Yeah , but I didn't get a response <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What if you get a response two or three months from now ? <vocalsound> so <vocalsound> we'll see <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay That'd be weird . that would be kinda creepy . Attempts to contact coach ineffective <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> <vocalsound> what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> so I don't n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever <disfmarker> basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . I think so . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . Yeah . With the natural look . That's very natural . <vocalsound> Very natural look . <vocalsound> Organic , really . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's the brilliance of <disfmarker> they had a p they had a peeler in here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And highly resourceful team mates might I add <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . which is always a plus . Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . <vocalsound> I think the teamwork was good as well . Mm yeah , I'm impressed . And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . <vocalsound> Nice . All four of those little containers . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . <vocalsound> Yeah , I guess <disfmarker> <vocalsound> My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> we only had four , wasn't enough . You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . I know <vocalsound> it could have been amazing . <vocalsound> Oh well . What did you guys think about the the the roles ? Hmm . They were good <vocalsound> . Yeah it's f kind of fun , Yeah . it was <disfmarker> I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . True . At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , Do your own . <vocalsound> which was kind of fun . Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . Yeah . I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . That's true , Nothing , I didn't even get an email , I I got this spreadsheet <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> like that was it . <vocalsound> So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . Well Whatever . I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to <disfmarker> Of what to do . well no but also <disfmarker> yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing <vocalsound> Mm . Mm-hmm . Uh-huh , that wasn't very much . <vocalsound> You know <disfmarker> um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was Mm . because that was kind of the interface portion Yeah . which was what the whole project was about Yes . Mm , mm . uh Hmm , very much so . but <disfmarker> and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , Yeah . That was fun . which was fine . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you Mm-hmm . Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . Very much so . Cool . And I think your leadership was quite good . It was really good yeah . Hmm . She said I I I she actually made a comment off <gap> boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get <disfmarker> I I felt like I got way too into it . Yeah . That's kind of a good thing though , I felt like I slipped into it a lot . It's kinda fun . you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . I dunno . An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . I usually organise crap , Hmm . it's one thing to do , you know <disfmarker> set up a party with your friends , <vocalsound> Yeah . you know ? Yeah . Little different . But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the <disfmarker> okay ? Yeah . Yeah . I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , <vocalsound> Yeah . other than that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I had to admit , as soon as w we started <disfmarker> I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , <vocalsound> th <vocalsound> you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I could only imagine . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , Possibly . like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos <disfmarker> did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos <disfmarker> Oh yeah , Yeah . Totally . still have 'em . everybody knows <disfmarker> best spaceships ever . Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? Yeah ? I think so . Yep . Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You don't . No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , I don't <disfmarker> I I was just <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> Though we didn't actually <disfmarker> I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't <disfmarker> except for the actual building , Yeah . but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board <disfmarker> It's true huh ? well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . Yeah . I mean I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team <vocalsound> you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . <vocalsound> It d Yeah that is kind of <disfmarker> But yeah . Interesting . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? I mean the whole process of <disfmarker> Wonder why <disfmarker> is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? I don't know . <vocalsound> I I don't know if there was a ri I th Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , Yeah , that's it I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , I mean I don't know that I would have Nor I . but I know that I consciously didn't . I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . True . Um , because I've got this laptop . Standard , Yeah . I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me . Yeah . I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . Well it looks really professional . I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized I know . because my handwriting is crap . Yeah , I mean , that's it . just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because <disfmarker> I know , <vocalsound> I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . You know , like what is the uh what exactly we're looking for here . So is this all we need to get through ? I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . I guess . Um . New ideas . It <disfmarker> did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? Is it <disfmarker> Well , that's the thing I got <disfmarker> i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , That slide was like that ? mm-hmm . I didn't change this one at all . Hmm . Well . Um ch I guess we're on the right track . Yeah well . <vocalsound> Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? <vocalsound> W <gap> <vocalsound> I kinda like th No , none . Uh I think they still do their job . <vocalsound> I think they're fine actually . Yeah you can't <disfmarker> I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form Yeah . I don't <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . Yeah . Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , It's still gotta be technically car shaped you can <disfmarker> or it won't fit on the road , <vocalsound> Yeah . you know ? <vocalsound> Don't know . Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . 'Kay . What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? Kind of . So this was other costs . Are we back into project mood ? I dunno . I think this is Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? How much time do we have left ? forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit <disfmarker> yeah <disfmarker> about the project eval , um . I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . Like , Mm . what like you know what am I really doing , you know what is <disfmarker> Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work Yep . and I was like <disfmarker> had like all this brainstorming I was doing Yeah . and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway <vocalsound> Why ? <vocalsound> so type away . <vocalsound> Hey . <vocalsound> Huh You know , you know what I mean I think it was the real <gap> . like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it Yeah . so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . Yeah . Definitely when <vocalsound> when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to <disfmarker> how much I stressed over it Mm-hmm . and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . Whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> . Very much , yeah . which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . <vocalsound> I actually didn't do that at all though , Mm-hmm . every single one I <disfmarker> a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . I di Oh I added like five slides too , <vocalsound> See Oh . I only got blank ones . Did you really ? but I <disfmarker> I just got blank ones and <disfmarker> What ? Really ? My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe Yeah , mine too . and they were just empty . Me too . Did they not have <disfmarker> they didn't like <disfmarker> uh mine <disfmarker> yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with <disfmarker> this was what it looks like . Like with those words already on it ? This is what that looked like , literally , just like that . No . No . Interesting . I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . <vocalsound> Uh-huh huh huh . I deleted slides <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I think I added a slide one time . I added many slides every time <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hey <vocalsound> with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . Yeah <vocalsound> . That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment . <vocalsound> Um . Mm . Interesting . Any other thoughts come to mind ? I wanna know how our product would fare . <vocalsound> I can't just leave it there . I think it would fail , I think <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . <vocalsound> But you know the whole <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Even you <vocalsound> . Yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I don't <disfmarker> we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . <vocalsound> Yeah but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I know it is <vocalsound> . It's a happy face . Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications <vocalsound> . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Builds . Mm . I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I noticed that . <vocalsound> By accident . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> that happened to be consumed . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Interesting . <vocalsound> Well huh . <vocalsound> An interesting day all in all I would say . <vocalsound> Yeah , Uh , yeah , I'd say so . it's uh <disfmarker> So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . I know . Mm , I know . Mm . It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce I wanna see a <disfmarker> I Yeah . although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . Well the id okay 'Cause it's such a functional item . the notion of <disfmarker> yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . Yeah . You know , maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of <disfmarker> we sh I I thought of I thought of <disfmarker> rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , Mm . I dunno . But . Hmm . All in all it's kinda interesting . Mm . So we have more slides or ? <vocalsound> No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it <disfmarker> We got it to be . We did the project evaluation based on um <vocalsound> Sarah's evaluation of on off switches Like cutting corners . Kind of , though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . and <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Which I'm not sure is the same thing , True . at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah Yay . what I'm gonna <disfmarker> I'm gonna put um <vocalsound> Hmm . I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like <disfmarker> maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . I <vocalsound> Make it sound eloquent . <vocalsound> It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording . Oh , I have to done <disfmarker> I've <vocalsound> I've done transcription before <vocalsound> Nice . and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that Oh yeah . that mean nothing . There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . What the uhs and the <disfmarker> Really . There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . Filler words or ? Yep , they're called um disfluencies . Disfluencies . That's a good word for it . Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . <vocalsound> Just add some prefixes , sounds classier . Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents . I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , I , Mm . Yeah . Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah I know . yeah , pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . <vocalsound> like c come on gimme something . Come on give me some information . <vocalsound> Well to be fair we're we're hooked <disfmarker> we're all hooked on the internet , Yeah , so I mean I do the <disfmarker> we are addicts . That's scary yeah ? It is scary . Mm . Well just around that eight or or nine people that are <disfmarker> I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? Yeah . I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . I yeah . Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years . True . No we have but I <disfmarker> not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous I yeah . Yeah . But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . It's crazy . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh-huh . In the eighties ? My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network . Mm . There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet Right . because it hadn't been Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him . You guys ready to celebrate ? Yeah that's our last step . Celebration . Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Should . I think so . 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . I think that's a closer . Cool . Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? <gap> this has been long enough . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Celebrate . <vocalsound> Where do you find that ? <vocalsound> I have no idea . <vocalsound> Is that the only song you have ? There is another one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is this one of those media player ? Huh ? Yep . <vocalsound> W oh . That's awesome . The default track . Maybe I have a different one . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . So is that a close ? Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner . Okay , that's the end of the meeting . Fab . Thank you gentlemen . I feel like I'm signing off .
Good morning . Sorry ? Yeah , busy job . Good morning . So <disfmarker> Oh , good morning everyone . Good morning . Good morning . I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . I've prepared a little presentation . My name is <gap> and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you <gap> on what actually is the project . This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . Um this is the opening , then we will get <disfmarker> <gap> I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . We'll do a little tool training with these two things . We'll take a look at the project plan . Uh there will be time for discussion . Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . And then we will close this session . Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . Um there are cameras <vocalsound> everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a a set of microphones <vocalsound> and there are microphones here also . But please uh don't be afraid of them . <vocalsound> They won't hurt you . <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> Um well uh I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . Let's start with the ladies <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . Well uh I'm uh <gap> and my uh function is User Interface Design , I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So uh that's me . Okay , uh I'm <gap> uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh <disfmarker> look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project . Okay , so I . Me too . My name's <gap> . I'm uh <vocalsound> Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other . Okay , well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company . <vocalsound> That's good . Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a <disfmarker> to design a new remote control which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . <vocalsound> And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project <disfmarker> such a product . Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . Okay . But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh we will have to take advantage of these two things . They are smart boards . As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . And uh this one here is a white board . I will uh instruct you about that soon . Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything's okay , <vocalsound> but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . Oh . As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . Um does everyone understand this <vocalsound> So we can't erase anything . Mm-hmm . Yeah . nice application ? Well you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one . Right . S I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet . Alright . But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages . And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , Okay . to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . Well I'm not very good at drawing , but I will uh go first and um try to draw <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good . <vocalsound> Hmm . <gap> No . It's a sheep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Dinos Seal , a seal . <vocalsound> Dinosaur . <vocalsound> Beaver . <gap> A beaver . <vocalsound> A be <vocalsound> Well it uh It's weird . <vocalsound> could be everything . Mm . With a tail and a mouth . Maybe when I put on It has wings ? Turtle . this thing it could be a turtle , or a snail , Snail . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well the snail doesn't have legs . Okay . But a turtle has . And those are slow . <vocalsound> And I hope our project group will not be slow , but we will uh work to a good result <vocalsound> and do it uh as fast as we can . Okay , time for another animal . Would you like to go next ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No problem . No problem . Sure . <vocalsound> Oh right . Mm . It was four months ? <vocalsound> Nice , okay . Well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The hell . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> To make it a little bit easier . <gap> <vocalsound> It's a giraffe . Make that cute . <vocalsound> Or a dinosaur . <vocalsound> No , it's a giraffe . 'Kay . <gap> I think it's easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe . <gap> Yes . Giraffe . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , <vocalsound> it can reach everything . And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . So that's my favourite animal . Okay . Anything else you need to know ? Could you write the words , uh underneath it ? Oh , Or more words . uh <gap> <vocalsound> Tall . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Tall . So , 'kay . Should I uh <disfmarker> Alright . <gap> So I can draw , but uh <disfmarker> Uh . Well . <vocalsound> Oh . B <vocalsound> It's a mouse . <vocalsound> Bunny rabbit . <vocalsound> A bunny rabbit . <vocalsound> <gap> Oh wrong one . Uh . <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well uh <gap> you can guess what it is , I hope . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . No problem . It's a rabbit . Little rabbits . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh well uh it's uh quick , I guess . That's uh my uh favourite animal . <vocalsound> Okay , Okay . thank you . And our final drawing . <vocalsound> Bob Ross . Dolphin . A dolphin . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , um . <vocalsound> Uh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> One of the most intelligent uh Right . Mm-hmm . animals in our world . Well . <gap> Yeah intelligent . <vocalsound> With an E_ . <vocalsound> I've I've uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Eraser . <vocalsound> You can try out the eraser now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Pen . Well not perfect , but okay . Okay , well <gap> thank you very much . I can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not really . <vocalsound> huh ? Well , nice animals , nice words . Sounds good . Um back to business , back to the money part . Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you . <gap> What's your experience with remote control ? A lot of buttons . I always lose them . Yeah . And you always lose them . <vocalsound> Yes . A lot of buttons which you don't use Yeah . Mm-hmm . or who you don't use Complex . Complex . Yeah . <gap> Not user friendly . <gap> search for the buttons , which one is which No . <gap> No . and uh <disfmarker> <gap> Boring . <vocalsound> Boring , <gap> it's not fun to use a remote . No . Mm . Black , all black . Well . Mm-hmm . So , Black colours . yeah . Well maybe we should try to make it fun . Mm-hmm . <gap> They use batteries and <gap> batteries uh and poor signal . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Uh . The the angle you have to use . Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . You had different remote controls for different devices . Yeah , different remote controls , <vocalsound> Yes , yeah . perhaps you can integrate them or something . Yes . Uh for the use of different uh devices <vocalsound> . Yes . Yeah . Your stereo and your T_V_ Mm-hmm . <gap> and uh . Perhaps that's an idea . Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , Yeah , that's right . so <disfmarker> Yeah but you could uh I thin uh And which you don't use . there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection Flap so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em . yeah . Right . Yeah , okay , that's possible , That's possible , so that you only get the <disfmarker> but it'll get very big the the remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah . No n n no , You should just give it to <gap> . <vocalsound> just <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um <vocalsound> the usual buttons such as uh um <vocalsound> zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Changing channel . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Or uh <vocalsound> the numbers , of course . <gap> numbers . But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television . On and off . You only use those uh the first time , or . Yeah , play , pause , stop . So . Uh . Mm-hmm . So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons . Yeah , I think so , yeah . <gap> Yes . But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . Mm-hmm , of course . Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , <vocalsound> w <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah , uh teletext . what's the name ? Mm-hmm . <gap> <gap> think so . Okay . So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons No . so they don't have to get out of their seat . Yeah . Yeah . But <vocalsound> Right . Because I think a market will be all kind of people . Elderly p el elderly , young people , so . But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in <disfmarker> think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s Uh . that uh <disfmarker> Yeah I think that's the better one , Yeah I I understand . And the B_B_C_ <gap> . because <disfmarker> I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think . <vocalsound> No . Yes <gap> . Yeah , I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though . I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we can leave that <gap> . When I think of it uh Not that much . I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh to make it user friendly . So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . Mm . Standard deliver . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons . You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . In those <disfmarker> in that <disfmarker> No but <disfmarker> Well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . Yeah . Yeah , th it <vocalsound> it's <disfmarker> I think that's not <disfmarker> That's not <disfmarker> Yeah but I <disfmarker> but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference <disfmarker> different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible . Yeah , that's right . Yeah , okay <gap> . Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for <disfmarker> to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh <disfmarker> No . Yeah that's uh <gap> . I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this . Yeah , but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control . Well not everywhere . So <gap> I think numerals . Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television . Yeah , but then you have to choose the <disfmarker> always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . Yeah , you can choose the code <gap> . You can use which which type of television you have . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , That's no problem . But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , I think . but <vocalsound> uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because <vocalsound> because uh the first <disfmarker> they lost the one they lost first one Simplicity . or the first one is broken , Yeah . so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . so that option is not <vocalsound> uh optional for those uh people . Yeah . Yeah g available . But the people have a new television , True . and c if you look into the future , then they want <disfmarker> will want the button , if their thing is broke . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . So we should take that in consideration . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay , well any more ideas ? Oh mm , <vocalsound> no . Of course . No ? Guess not . Things'll come up . Yeah . Okay , yeah well we have some time . Let's see what more I have to tell you . I don't think there is much left . Nope . We're starting to close . Um our next meeting uh will start <disfmarker> well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions . Um , as you can see , the different roles have uh different tasks . And there's a ping . <vocalsound> Is it my laptop ? Yeah . Yep . Stop the meeting now <vocalsound> . Ah well Yeah meeting will close in five minutes . <vocalsound> that's good , five minutes and uh the meeting's over , uh right on schedule . Okay . Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design . And this was the Interface Designer ? Or the Interaction Designer . Hmm hmm . Mm . Or what was it , I_D_ ? No No ? Interface . interface . Interface Designer , okay , first guess was right . Uh will take a look at the the working design . No , the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , No the <disfmarker> Yeah . and the in uh usability interaction <disfmarker> <gap> Industrial Designer , okay , Yeah , okay . <vocalsound> Okay . sorry . <vocalsound> Let's just use the acronyms . So <disfmarker> Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach . So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , or uh , or how <disfmarker> I don't really <disfmarker> Uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly , I hope . <vocalsound> Right . Alright . <vocalsound> Me too . <vocalsound> And of course you have your own uh expertise . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well uh that was what I had to say . Uh-huh . Uh are there any more questions ? Okay . No . No . No ? Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working . I have one question . Okay . Okay , one question ? Oh . Where does it says we have to make a remote , because I presumed <disfmarker> <gap> She didn't know who . Okay , no <vocalsound> , no problem . <vocalsound> <gap> No problem . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay we're still going <gap> <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> No problem . Yeah . Okay , well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly . Mm-hmm . Alright . Okay well uh Alrighty . Okay . see you all in about thirty minutes , then . Yeah . <vocalsound> Thank you very much . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound>
Okay . 'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings <vocalsound> <vocalsound> , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this <disfmarker> And I can start if you want . Mm . sure . Is there an order ? No . We haven't decided on an order . Hm ? No , any any order's fine . Yeah . First . Okay . Um , how do I put this <disfmarker> Just uh <disfmarker> I'll just put the cable in . Oh yeah , sorry . <gap> Is that it ? Can you see ? <vocalsound> Oh , here . Okay . So what happens it doesn't work ? It sh it takes a few seconds I think . You may need to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Who's that ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> Is it in the right thing ? But sometimes you have to do it <disfmarker> it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . Oh wait , um . Uh . You need to help me . <vocalsound> Uh-huh , and then press function . <vocalsound> Yeah . and F_ eight . Could you just plug it back into hers because she had <disfmarker> Oh , wait . That's <disfmarker> oh . is that it ? Adjusting . Here we are . <vocalsound> The cable might be a little loose or something . Right here we are . Oh , you got it . Oh . Is it on ? We're here . Okay . Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue . Hm . Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than <disfmarker> you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um , about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together . <vocalsound> And that's all I have to say about the matter , <vocalsound> um . 'Kay . Shall I <disfmarker> what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ? Yeah . Just move right on . Right . So get this . Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? <vocalsound> Uh function F_ eight . Function F_ eight . 'Kay . What's function ? It's the little blue <disfmarker> w it's the one <disfmarker> th Oh function , I see it . yeah . There we go . Yeah should be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It should be <gap> yeah . Okay . Um . This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um <vocalsound> just what what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> And okay so basically um <vocalsound> I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um <vocalsound> so I think things like uh you know keeping buttons together that <disfmarker> like close together that um <vocalsound> are used in the same way , uh <vocalsound> or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh <disfmarker> can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um <vocalsound> does it do <disfmarker> or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but <disfmarker> And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . <vocalsound> Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um <vocalsound> like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . <vocalsound> That concludes my presentation . <gap> Okay . You need the little thingy . Ooh . How do I um <disfmarker> S That's on view . Oh . Right . Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation . 'Kay . Do you know about like <disfmarker> I dunno , you seem like you know about <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm ? Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here . Okay . Cool . <vocalsound> Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um <vocalsound> we have <disfmarker> we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something <disfmarker> I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um . So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um , yeah . <vocalsound> Do <disfmarker> Let's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I guess we should yeah make some kind of brainstorming , Like in terms of see what we can <disfmarker> How it looks or <disfmarker> how it looks , or like what it does ? wha what <disfmarker> um <vocalsound> well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group Okay . and I dunno the the s the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . Yeah . Okay . So <disfmarker> Is our target group then people <disfmarker> so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think that seems to <disfmarker> yeah . Mm . It's easy to implement . Okay . So the <disfmarker> <gap> the the buzzer you mean , yeah , yeah , yeah . yeah , for sure , yeah . Locator . So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , Yeah , teenagers and young professionals . what was it ? Well that's for speech recognition . Oh . Well <disfmarker> Oh , uh . And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen . I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . or <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . it seems like a silly , I mean <disfmarker> Yeah . I'm not sure how you would implement it . I just put the values <vocalsound> in . <vocalsound> And if if you consider our budget , it probably <disfmarker> But um the screen is the same as what , <gap> <vocalsound> It's a cool idea but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . Yeah . Yeah , I'm happy with that . <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Completely . Hu yeah . Right so um <disfmarker> yeah . Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a <disfmarker> like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself . Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place <gap> since the T_V_ already has power . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . Okay . Okay . Yeah . Okay . Alright . Okay . Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . <vocalsound> Okay . So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can <disfmarker> It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote <vocalsound> . right . Yeah , yeah . So do you plug it in the T_ <disfmarker> you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ? Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button . Okay . Okay . So it's now like a two-part thing . Yeah , so it would be a two part package . Okay . Alright . Okay . So we get to design that too . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Make it fashionable . Um , okay . So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . Yeah I think so . Yeah . Just there . Huh . Okay . Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the <vocalsound> thing to put the <disfmarker> you s you talking about a home for it . Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall Yeah . or shall we leave that for now ? We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , Okay . like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Then it can live anywhere . Yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . For the <disfmarker> so you have that button , that <disfmarker> so there's <disfmarker> is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? Are we just having a radio ? On the phone . Um it seemed like a <disfmarker> a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , T You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah . I think that's what the phone has , Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah . I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it <vocalsound> and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so You can hear it's under the couch yeah . <disfmarker> yeah . So i Yeah . Um , <vocalsound> <gap> So need the other buttons . So we have this <disfmarker> mm . So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them <vocalsound> , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That was that was me . yeah you you did um , they're <disfmarker> I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . Oh really . And uh 'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . Yeah . Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across <disfmarker> international ? They're not <disfmarker> no . They're not , no . Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . S Yeah , that's right , yeah . <vocalsound> It not V_H_S_ here ? But D_V_D_ probably is . Yeah , other than that region and coding thing . Um <disfmarker> But V_C_R_s <disfmarker> And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days . Yeah . Yeah , for sure . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So . Okay , let's see if I can <disfmarker> I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take <disfmarker> like just reduce the number of buttons you know , Yeah . like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . Yeah . Well for sure we need the um <disfmarker> I think we can just design the channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , S Yeah . Mm-hmm . Huh . s and it's usually that red Yeah . Yeah . and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red . Yeah . You know , I've seen some remotes that <disfmarker> where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just <disfmarker> Oh okay , yeah . It seems like that would be hard though . But <disfmarker> I mean , like because unless you know <disfmarker> It might be confusing . yeah . Yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't <disfmarker> I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . <vocalsound> Yeah . Besides you like to be able to go power . Yeah , I never think to hold something down . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I have the power <vocalsound> Yeah . B <vocalsound> Yeah . I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Yeah . Right . Well even um iPod thing <vocalsound> <vocalsound> , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . scrolling <disfmarker> I don't know . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Because people li seem <disfmarker> now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no <disfmarker> Know you don't have one two three four five <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , Mm . it's it's funny like you f like I just <disfmarker> I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and <disfmarker> it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know . Yeah . Yeah yeah , it's just <disfmarker> and it's one thing which has everything . Yeah , and it is <disfmarker> yeah . It is really <disfmarker> but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? Well can't it tell the <disfmarker> like can't you <disfmarker> if you <disfmarker> Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . Oh that's gonna <disfmarker> Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of <disfmarker> Like a disc . Yeah . Yeah . It's like <disfmarker> it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . okay . I've never used one . No . It's like l this <disfmarker> like that , and then you do that . Okay . Okay . Yeah . Yeah and then . And then you can have um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing <vocalsound> like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that <disfmarker> Or it <disfmarker> Yeah , oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can <disfmarker> you can <disfmarker> Well i Yeah , click o actually click on to have <disfmarker> zap . Okay . We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . Yeah . Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom <disfmarker> So do you need to <disfmarker> Doesn't it rotate though , okay . so it'll be moving around . Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like <disfmarker> What do you mean the function ? I mean like okay , 'cause so <disfmarker> I dunno , I guess <disfmarker> Okay <disfmarker> so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . But then <disfmarker> so if you wanna switch to the <disfmarker> to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . Yeah but it knows for some reason . It just <disfmarker> The iPod knows . It just kno <vocalsound> the iPod knows . <vocalsound> S <vocalsound> If it works on an iPod then it works . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Huh . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . I don't have one . Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . Oh . And then <disfmarker> well if you do that it goes , So it's like holding <disfmarker> but if you <disfmarker> like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen . You can <disfmarker> o And you you <disfmarker> is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually <disfmarker> you're just using the mouse to go up and down . Well what you <disfmarker> Like <disfmarker> for the iPod you press an <disfmarker> It's like a b w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . Mm-hmm . But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure <disfmarker> Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? Yeah . Like you could just have <disfmarker> I don't know , you could click and then have it up and down , Oh , like <disfmarker> Like <disfmarker> Oh you could actually <disfmarker> but I think <disfmarker> I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah <vocalsound> . Yeah . But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be <disfmarker> is that part of <disfmarker> Is that what makes them expensi yeah , <vocalsound> I don't think so . I think it's all of <disfmarker> I dunno , I dunno . they have so much memory though , You don't think so ? that's <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> I don't think it's the wheel dealy . Okay . I think it <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they <disfmarker> it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> . I'm thinking we could <disfmarker> if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . And they're re-programmable aren't they ? You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , Yeah . Yeah . that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . Yeah . Yeah . S Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation <vocalsound> , is that people find it <disfmarker> find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote Yeah . and that's another thing they complained about . Mm . Yeah . Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume <disfmarker> oh we've ts just said that . So okay . Channel selection . This is just for T_V_ , it's not for <disfmarker> or it is <disfmarker> does need to be compatible with <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , Yeah . So how do you switch <disfmarker> Menu . You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . and menu maybe . Oh yeah . So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next <disfmarker> Okay . So like if we had that <disfmarker> But we'll hold off on that 'cause <disfmarker> Yeah . But s yeah uh . But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote . That's true , yeah . Yeah . So , I know I'm not c really clear on what <disfmarker> But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm . Yeah . So you'd have to have like <disfmarker> Mm . I think <disfmarker> you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can <disfmarker> you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . Yeah , it is only fun Yeah , but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . But i Oh . Yeah . But I think the circle only does <disfmarker> channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna <disfmarker> Yeah but it <disfmarker> it would be <disfmarker> but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . So <disfmarker> but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're <disfmarker> if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different <disfmarker> I mean do we need to think about that , that like <disfmarker> Um , yeah , let's think about it Yes we can try that . 'cause we need to wrap up . <vocalsound> Okay . Um <vocalsound> let's see . <vocalsound> Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . See you soon . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
I wanna find our if our remote works . Me too . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Um here's the agenda for our last meeting . Whoohoo . Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so let's get started . Oh , no , let's have the prototype presentation . Mm 'kay , <gap> you ready ? Um sure . You or me ? Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it . Okay . Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . I'll be the Vanna . <vocalsound> The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . Right . Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . Hmm . It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . That's nice . Yeah . The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it <disfmarker> just that one button will light up . Good . Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ <vocalsound> which will actually look like our logo . <vocalsound> Great . And then on the side you have the buttons . <vocalsound> They're one button , but they kind of push up and down . Okay . I don't think they're scrolling . No . They're just buttons . <vocalsound> Right , yeah . And then <disfmarker> yeah , the buttons . On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , <gap> can't see underneath . Yeah . So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock <gap> you know , stick your finger in . Yeah . Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , Thumb-shaped . and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . Yeah . And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . <vocalsound> Okay . And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? <vocalsound> I'd say a single . Single . Single . Single sounds good , 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double . Yeah . Right . Yeah , it's only actually the size of my hand . Great . Great . I think you did an awesome job . Yeah , I think it's a beautiful <disfmarker> It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . <vocalsound> Yeah . Good job , you guys . Good job . Oh thank you . <vocalsound> Whoohoo . Those are really good . Alright <vocalsound> <gap> what's next in our agenda ? Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney . Okay , it's a PowerPoint presentation . I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . It's under evaluation . Right . Alright . Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh <disfmarker> yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . Mm . Feel good meaning what ? Like does it feel good , like <disfmarker> Physically , yeah , physically . Right . okay . <gap> <vocalsound> Sqi <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's just for current trend . Right . <vocalsound> It doesn't really count , you guys . Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . <vocalsound> Yeah . But it's <disfmarker> so we do have removable covers , right ? <gap> Right . Yes . Yeah , well then that's covered . And so we n k 'Kay . everybody have that ? I'll wait . Yeah , she's got it . It's good . Yeah . Yeah . Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? Are we going to indi True or false , easy to use . I say we individually rate <disfmarker> what do you say ? You guys <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Just orally . Why not ? We have <disfmarker> okay . Okay . Um easy to use . I vote six . Oh wait , that's false . Oh , <vocalsound> two . Okay . I'd say two as well . Yeah , two . Two . That's what I say . Uh hello , we're great . <vocalsound> Okay , fashionable ? <vocalsound> Um one . At the moment , no . No . No . I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable . Me too , very chic . <vocalsound> I thi I would give it a one . Okay . One , I give it a one . <vocalsound> I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . Well , that's that's just like <disfmarker> that's a clay , it's a prototype . Oh , and ma it's a prototype , right . What do you think ? Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . I'd give it like three or four . Well , now I'm <gap> . Okay . <vocalsound> So , the average is about a two . Yeah , it's a two . But then I'm not fashionable , so Two or three . don't use my opinion . Two point five . That's okay . Yeah . Neither are all o all the customers we have , either . <vocalsound> Um does it feel good ? <vocalsound> Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . I feel like <disfmarker> Does it feel good ? Uh the shape of it actually does uh . And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . It's gonna be curved . Yeah , it's gonna be thicker . Yeah . Depth . I think it feels good . I think so too . I'll give it a two . 'Kay . Two . <vocalsound> I'll give it a one . What do you say ? I'd say a two . Alright , average is two . Okay . Is it technologically innovative ? Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here . Oh no , it's fine , <vocalsound> you're <disfmarker> I mean you're Project Manager . Go right ahead . <vocalsound> Um yeah , I mean and it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> does it have voice <disfmarker> I mean the phrase recognition on it ? Yes . Right ? We were able to do it with that kind of chip . Oh right , the <disfmarker> We could do it with the chip , yes . It wasn't <disfmarker> we have no reflection of it on the prototype , And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y Yeah , right . but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . That was <disfmarker> 'kay . <vocalsound> Yeah , so . <vocalsound> And we discussed that being included . Right . Then yes , then I would <disfmarker> well it isn't <disfmarker> what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? It <disfmarker> Well we don' have the <disfmarker> you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , so I'd probably give it a three . Right . Yeah . Okay . Even though it is <disfmarker> for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . But it is just a T_V_ remote . Yeah . I'd go for a three or four on that one , so <disfmarker> Yeah I go four . okay , let's go for a three point five . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Three and an half . Alright , and the last criteria <disfmarker> is it is it um <disfmarker> Squishy and fruity . <vocalsound> Well yeah , so I'd give it a two . Well , we've covered that with the It's just trendy , basically . trendy . It's capable of being squishy and fruity . Sure . Capable . Very capable . Oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity . <vocalsound> Okay . And <vocalsound> it's very important . Yeah . 'Kay , there we go . Okay , next . So . Next . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good job , team . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> How did you get that in there ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What ? The <vocalsound> slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It does . It <vocalsound> it does . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That was good . Thanks . <vocalsound> Very good . Alright , let's go back to this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , that's it . Hmm . Oops . Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance , okay . I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit . 'Kay ? So let me bring that up . Here we go . Alright . Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a <disfmarker> Yep . Two . Number of components you plan to use . Do I just put quantity being one battery , or <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Mm 'kay . But if it's a <disfmarker> do you wanna go for <disfmarker> this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . Oh , let's just go for a lithium . What do you say ? Yeah , let's let's do a lithium . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> I think uh it's <gap> . I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced , <disfmarker> right . yeah . Okay , down to the electronics um section . We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , Yeah . Yep . so one of those . It is a single-curved , so one of those . Uh <gap> . Oh . What's that ? Yeah , that's correct . Yeah . 'Kay , down here , case material . It's plastic . We <disfmarker> plastic . Plastic . And special colour . And special colour . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Down here , interface type . We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel . No , we don't have the scroll . <vocalsound> Isn't <disfmarker> oh those are just regular buttons . But it's <disfmarker> Well , that's the push-button too , right there . Buttons . Yeah , but i so i This ? Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . <vocalsound> We're really having just push-button interface . Okay , so we can just go <disfmarker> um . But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . But it <disfmarker> that just covers the type of button we're having . Because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button . Oh like the <disfmarker> twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and Push-button . push-buttons . Okay . Right I think she's <disfmarker> But we just have push But we don't have any scrolls . I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? Like because there's like one interface right here and then <disfmarker> because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . Right . Yeah . So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? Okay . I don't know , they might put us <disfmarker> well , let's just . Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ? Let's call it th Two or would it be three ? Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . Okay , fine . Yeah . I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . Well less than twenty nine even . Okay . Okay and we're gonna <disfmarker> <vocalsound> button supplements <disfmarker> the buttons are no They're a special colour . uh okay . Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented . Are they ? Oh , right . And then s And , they're a special material . yeah . Mm . Well , we're under cost then . Alright . We're over ? No , we're under . Grand . We're under . Twelve point five is our limit . Okay . Oh , I see . We've got eleven point two . So we can go to production . Alright . We can go to <disfmarker> I dunno what I just did . <vocalsound> Okay . Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . Um did we have a lot of room for creativity ? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , um teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . Now , question is , how do we do this ? <vocalsound> Go back . <vocalsound> I think we just discuss it . Discuss , sure . Previous . Alright . Who want who would like to go first ? We think we got stifled for cri <vocalsound> creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . We didn't have a whiteboard . Hmm . Yeah . Oh that's true . Hmm . And no internet . Yeah . <vocalsound> No , yeah , that's a good point . 'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , yeah . <vocalsound> And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We got to choose <disfmarker> basically we had control over <disfmarker> minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . Right , and we got say over what <disfmarker> how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like <disfmarker> And we're a fashion forward technology company . we <disfmarker> yep . <gap> right . You know it . Um what about um the teamwork aspect ? How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I think we did well . I think ya' did . Did you work well together in there , and <disfmarker> Yep . <vocalsound> Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but <disfmarker> no <vocalsound> . 'kay . Minus that one fight . <vocalsound> Gouges . Yeah . Oh my God , and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . We hadn't had any ma fallings out . I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? <vocalsound> Irritating . Irritating . <vocalsound> Irritating , yeah . Irritating . Wow that's a <disfmarker> it's definitely a strong one . Okay . The means , the whiteboard didn't work . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And no internet . Yeah . Yeah . I have to knock that one down a couple notches . <vocalsound> A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . <vocalsound> Yeah , and no internet . Misses . I do . <vocalsound> And the digital the digital pens There's so much available . Like it's information Yeah , digital pens . <vocalsound> I really appreciated those , yeah . were <disfmarker> they were pretty cool . They were fine . Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . <vocalsound> The use of the laptops for receiving everything . It was wireless too , so . Yeah . Right , laptops are extremely handy , wireless . And these things whoa . And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the <disfmarker> Yeah . And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . Yeah . And Big Brother . Big brother . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? Um we are really gonna sell this . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ta-da . For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . Yeah . And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . Mm-hmm . If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think <disfmarker> I mean that's not what technology . Well , that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . Mm . They look like they did when I was in elementary school , Yeah . Yeah , 'cause they're pretty and that's so old-fashioned to me . and just like <disfmarker> The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids . Yeah . Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad <disfmarker> Yeah . Just the Mac font bothers me even . Uh yeah . Yeah . But I do like iPods , go figure . Yeah , no , iPods <vocalsound> <disfmarker> They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs . Yeah . Well , i iPods are now quite trendy , and they come in different colours . Mm-hmm . Colours . Exactly . <vocalsound> Yeah . I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . Oh yeah , everybody . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Mine is amber . Anyway , so that is definitely at work . Not me . But the <disfmarker> my <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I didn't have a phone 'til university . but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . Oh . I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . Look at it . <vocalsound> Yeah . That is a piece of work . <vocalsound> Fashionable chic people will . You're kidding . <vocalsound> Wow . No , no . Marketing Director says yeah . Fashionable people will buy it . <vocalsound> No , marketing has to actually create the desire for it . <vocalsound> Oh , I will create desire . <vocalsound> That's okay . We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . This will help them find the one . Ri <vocalsound> They'll be sexy with it . <vocalsound> Hmm . We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf . That's right . <vocalsound> Oh right . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> That'll sell . <vocalsound> And so the serpent says , use our remote . <vocalsound> There you go , marketing <gap> . Let you loose . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright . Yeah , no . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , we're gonna wrap this up now . Um the costs are within the budget , <vocalsound> we evaluated the project , and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so . Whoohoo . Margaritas for everyone . <vocalsound> Alright , thank you team , you did a great job , it was lovely working with you . <vocalsound> Good . You too . Yay . Thanks to the Project Leader . <vocalsound> Now we know w
<vocalsound> Hmm hmm hmm . Are we <disfmarker> we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? Yeah . Okay , that's fine . Am I supposed to be standing up there ? So we've got both of these clipped on ? Okay . She gonna answer me or not ? Yeah , I've got <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Right , both of them , okay . Yes . God . <vocalsound> Jesus , it's gonna fall off <gap> . Okay . Yep , yep . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Tu tu tu tu Hello everybody . Hi , good morning . Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Okay , this is our agenda , um <vocalsound> we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh <disfmarker> people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . Um , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . 'Kay . Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Oops . Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . Um <disfmarker> What's missing ? We're running out of blue . Okay . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . Mm . And I see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . Oh sorry . Mm-hmm . Now , who would like to go next ? Yeah , me . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <gap> Cat . Where did this come from ? Is that your lapel then ? Uh , yep . There you go . Thank you . Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? A kind of dog ? <vocalsound> Yep . It's actually sitting , so <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's sitting down . Sorry ? it's sitting , it's not standing . Uh . Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive . It's your best friend and your <disfmarker> you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . <gap> dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person Mm-hmm . so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . Okay , thank you . Thank you . Yeah I'll have a go . Okay . Sorry . Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , Thanks . I'm little , <vocalsound> Alright , okay . you can get to the top , with standing on a chair . Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . <vocalsound> Does it look like a dog actually ? <vocalsound> Okay . And also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah . <vocalsound> Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um <disfmarker> Mm . I think it's outstandingly good . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be <vocalsound> because that looks like a beak now , so . <vocalsound> Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . Crocodile ? Gonna be a bird . Is it gonna be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well it was it was an <disfmarker> at first <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it's gonna be a bird . firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican O but it can be a crocodile now actually <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's lovely . Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . Um Beauti that's <disfmarker> uh scary , uh strong , yeah that's about it I think <vocalsound> . Okay <vocalsound> it's fine . <vocalsound> Okay . Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , Uh uh <disfmarker> mine's <disfmarker> are dreadful . Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . Wo <vocalsound> I hope that clicks in , I'll just <disfmarker> I'll hold it on , okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oops , oh dear , what happened there ? Technical help . Hopefully that'll stay on , Hmm . two-handed version . Okay . Okay , uh <disfmarker> Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um . Uh <disfmarker> Oh dear , Hmm . it doesn't look what like what I want it to be <vocalsound> . S Uh . Uh <disfmarker> It's not a vampire bat honestly <vocalsound> . <gap> <vocalsound> Okay , yeah . Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . Okay , some sort of bird <vocalsound> That's my dreadful <disfmarker> that's the worst yet , that's <disfmarker> it's meant to be an eagle <vocalsound> A seagu Ah eagle , right okay . Eagle , okay . right , not a seagull <vocalsound> . you can tell it's a flying animal <vocalsound> could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . <vocalsound> Da dum um . They're good at golf . Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? <vocalsound> Eagle . Yeah , Are they ? no yeah , Oh . Oh right , okay , an eagle . <vocalsound> I'm not good at golf . <gap> <vocalsound> I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . And uh , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , Mm-hmm . intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid . <vocalsound> There we go , That's lovely . hope that pen's gonna be okay . <vocalsound> Whoops . <vocalsound> Okay . That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ? It's about <disfmarker> Seventeen . mm , mm yeah . One point four or something like that . One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . Yeah , yeah , something like that , so that <disfmarker> Yeah . D fifteen ? yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . Seventeen Pounds . Seventeen . Okay , that's expensive . Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ? But <disfmarker> I think so , I think so , Yeah , okay . I'll be able to um pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something . Okay . Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those <disfmarker> the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . So , it'd still be <disfmarker> Right . Really ? yeah , we had to buy one <vocalsound> . So Mm . so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , I think <disfmarker> we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? Yeah , Hmm . um production cost's at twelve fifty , so Okay , pretty huge margin . half of the selling price is taken up by building it . Yeah . Mm . Mm-hmm . Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , which is uh <disfmarker> In our first year ? Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . So then <disfmarker> You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a <disfmarker> um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups Mm-hmm . just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone No , <disfmarker> user-friendly to everyone . yeah . Okay . Big target group <vocalsound> . So <disfmarker> yes , yes , I don't think we have to <disfmarker> I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , No . um making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . Mm . Okay . What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got <disfmarker> we got um <disfmarker> we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up Mm-hmm . Yeah . so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , Alright . Yeah . Yeah , that c but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , Mm-hmm . Yeah so that might have had something to do with it , uh . but that was quite good , the fact that you could <disfmarker> You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . Use all the ones at the same time . Right . Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like <disfmarker> Yeah , Mm-hmm . Okay . 'cause you <disfmarker> My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , Mm . I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . Yeah , the main <disfmarker> that's the main stuff anyway , I mean Mm-hmm . <disfmarker> and you don't want to <disfmarker> I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do Mm . and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . Yeah . Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , Yeah . symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . <vocalsound> Um . So simplification of symbols you could think of . When they're <disfmarker> when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . Oh yeah . Mm-hmm . 'Cause it doesn't make <disfmarker> when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , Mm . it's obvious what you're doing , um . Mm-hmm . Mm . Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , Mm-hmm . Menu , alright . I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , Yeah . so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . Uh uh <disfmarker> Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . With menus , yeah , yeah . And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . Yeah . What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ? <vocalsound> You mean to save it lesser number . Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? Right . I don't think they tape things , Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so <vocalsound> I don't think they use <disfmarker> Right . Right . So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , Yeah . that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , Mm , yeah , the age gap . Yeah , what it just needs to be <disfmarker> as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . Mm . Mm-hmm . I don't know , But I don't know how <disfmarker> I d I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . Oh yeah . Mm-hmm . I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost <vocalsound> in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one Right . and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me . Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , <vocalsound> Yeah . you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . Mm-hmm . Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? Okay . Obviously it displays less on the screen , Teletext has got that option as well . it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . Yeah . Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things Mm-hmm . and also <disfmarker> and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is <disfmarker> you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . Mm-hmm . Mm , okay . I think that's a cost thing , S Y I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about <disfmarker> It might Yeah ? it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . Mm-hmm . Yes , no that's important . Yeah , like smaller . Yeah . But it might have its cost implications . Okay . And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? Mm . Right . Something that's easily moulded and produced . Yeah . Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . <vocalsound> No uh uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again Yeah . and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . Just just a quick thing about the um <vocalsound> Sure . about what you're saying about the uh <disfmarker> does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of <disfmarker> I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh <disfmarker> we put the fashion into electronics , Ah right . so I think think the whole design thing might be qui Okay . Okay . Okay . Sure b I mean you don't <disfmarker> you you can still have plastic y yeah . and it'd look quite good but <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know <vocalsound> th that was my main point , Yeah . we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , Mm . I presume it would . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I would <disfmarker> it would probably . I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , Right . so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . Okay . Okay , so let's break it up there . 'Kay . Okay ? Okay . So , see you in half an hour . Do we go back to our room ? Yep ? I think so , yeah . Mm , yeah .
Is everyone ready to start ? Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . Yeah . Okay . Great . Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running . Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . <vocalsound> The meeting will be forty minutes long . Okay . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . <vocalsound> Okay . Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint . Thank you . Okay . Should be just loading . <vocalsound> Okay . Oh , although I can't see it on my screen . That says go here . Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . <vocalsound> Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit . Um <disfmarker> Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . Yeah . We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . Mm . Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . <vocalsound> There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . Um <disfmarker> What is a hand-powered dynamo ? Um , where you manually charge up the power . Like you wind up something . Just every , every once in a while ? Sorry ? Just every once in a while or constantly ? Yeah . Every once in a while I think . But it's <disfmarker> Alright . It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time . I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . Right . But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , <vocalsound> 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . Mm . Because you can't really see which way round it is . Right . Um , we also can choose what materials <disfmarker> um , the <disfmarker> we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Wood . <vocalsound> Um , again , stepping back in time again there . <vocalsound> I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . Yeah . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects . Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some <disfmarker> we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , <disfmarker> they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we would have to have an L_C_D_ um Yeah . That's true . display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . And that would lead to an advanced <disfmarker> yeah . If we have <disfmarker> yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . Yeah . And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . Mm-hmm . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . <gap> . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different <disfmarker> depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton . Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . Right . <vocalsound> My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake . Yeah . <vocalsound> Sounds brilliant to me . Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Uh . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , <vocalsound> then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one . Yeah . Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these <vocalsound> chips and diodes and delicate technology as Mm-hmm . like as the exterior . This is the one thing that's protecting its innards . I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Another thing is it might be more difficult <disfmarker> if it's a rubber exterior <gap> talking about putting on interchangeable plates . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um , is it <disfmarker> I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way . Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . W So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top Yeah . Like <disfmarker> Yeah . I can't think of what . Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , Yeah . Yeah . b like a Nokia it is . Or like an <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just <disfmarker> it's protective as well . It's <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Like the skin ? Yeah . It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright . I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . So maybe the <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Yeah . So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . And then <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . And the buttons obviously are rubber . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> That sounds good . I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? As far as I know . It should be . Okay , <vocalsound> we'll just say yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yes , just why not . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright . I like the kinetic energy source idea . Yeah . I thought that was <disfmarker> Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . Yeah , tha But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um Mm-hmm . energy source . It could make an we could have any kind of style . Yeah . It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Just for environmental reasons . Yeah . <vocalsound> I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before . Yeah . So it seems <disfmarker> we'd have to do more research on it . Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack . Yeah . Like as a backup for something . Backup . Yeah Yeah . so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . Yeah . Yeah . So , if it was running off of one battery as a <disfmarker> That would be good yeah . Yeah . Some alternative just in case something went wrong . Right . Maybe we could <disfmarker> you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . That's true . I just thought of that <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . So maybe that could be incorporated as <disfmarker> May maybe that could be the backup . Yeah . Instead of a battery . Yeah . Although it needs some light , Like solar backup . doesn't it ? Yeah . I suppose Do , do those calculators <disfmarker> Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then . So , if we're doing <disfmarker> s but some <disfmarker> yeah . yeah . If we're <disfmarker> But thing is , it's not <disfmarker> you don't need the solar all the time . I don't know how it works . It can be stored . It can be like <disfmarker> Yeah . you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . Yeah . It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . Yeah . Like a few hours a day . <gap> . Yeah . I think that might be a little impractical though . Yeah . I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , and <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . That's true . It could easily <disfmarker> Yeah . Like people don't wanna have to worry about that . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . Yeah . And it works . Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it . Yeah . Yeah , I suppose . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and <gap> . Yeah . Yeah . Alright . Cool . K okay . 'S that the end of your presentation . Yeah . Yeah . Alright . Thank you . There we go . Thanks . Oh . <vocalsound> It's not on my screen . <gap> it wasn't on mine either . Why ? <vocalsound> I don't know why . I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there . You don't know why ? Oh okay . Is it that one ? Yeah . That's um <disfmarker> Yeah . Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or <vocalsound> by the human user . And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . Oh . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . I'm not really sure about the pictures that <disfmarker> maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . Mm . Or maybe it's the the buttons or pictures or something . <vocalsound> Hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Do you think it's <disfmarker> So I suppose sometime <disfmarker> Yeah , 'cause <disfmarker> after you . <vocalsound> I'm sorry ? <vocalsound> Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . Yeah . You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want . Yeah . Mm . So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . <vocalsound> Like an L_C_D_ screen . I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have <disfmarker> like the power would be s some kind of symbol . Yeah . And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , Yeah . you , they have <disfmarker> there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which <disfmarker> I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . Yeah . Yeah . But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . Yeah , we'll be doing <disfmarker> It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . Yeah . Yeah . It'd be more a command interface , Yeah . and then <disfmarker> I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that . Yeah . So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? The infrared is like , that's considered a <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> Hmm ? No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per Okay . So when it says pointing device that doesn't include <disfmarker> For inp Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . Yeah . I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things . Mm . Okay . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . But um I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . Yeah . Mm-hmm . But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in <disfmarker> just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe . <vocalsound> What do you mean ? Like <vocalsound> I can't think of an example , but <disfmarker> Sort of like little pictures rather than <disfmarker> Oh yeah , like how the buttons <disfmarker> Like a little sound . Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . Yeah , as a button though . Yeah , Mm . something y So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , Yeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe . right ? Okay . Yeah . I like that idea . Um , the co uh <disfmarker> we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple . Yeah . I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> A bit more too , yeah . Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . Yeah . It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming . <vocalsound> And that all interfaces are different . So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . Mm-hmm . Yep . Does anyone have any questions ? Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . Mm . I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , Yeah . Yeah . so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . But um <disfmarker> But what about the lighting up effect ? You mean different colours for the lighting or <disfmarker> Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would <disfmarker> if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up . Mm-hmm . Oh I see what you're saying . Well y If they were white they would glow , probably . If they were made out of rubber . Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . Oh . But , but I guess , you mean from the back . Oh . Where would the light come from ? Okay . I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . Right . Yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , Yeah , yeah . so we have that taken care of . Mm-hmm . It should be able to <disfmarker> mm-hmm . In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . Li yeah . So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . <vocalsound> Oh . Do you know what I mean ? Yeah . Oh . 'Cause it's just the wee control , They , they insert over . yeah , Okay . thing that's behind it . So <disfmarker> Mm . I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? Mm-hmm . Well , if they're raised up buttons . Yeah . So that you can feel them . We were talking about it being more um , a lot more tangible . T Um , it might be more difficult to do . Yeah . If they're , if they're sticking up . If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . I think it would be possible . I don't think it would make that much difference . I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . And then you get to the circuit . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . Yeah . I'm sure that'd be fine . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . Alright . If it's do-able we can do . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , sounds good to me . So that's everything , then ? Okay . Alright , thank you . Okay is that my turn then ? That means you're up . Yeah . Yeah . Alright . <vocalsound> I have a shorter report for you today . Um , it took a while to get this , uh <disfmarker> Uh . You're not plugged in yet . <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> That's a very good point . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . Um , <vocalsound> so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying . The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the <disfmarker> face-plates . Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . <vocalsound> So , pretty basic there . And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . <vocalsound> Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . Um <disfmarker> So , my personal preferences here , um of course , as <disfmarker> we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . Mm . <vocalsound> It could be one of the options . Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . Mm-hmm . Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . Mm-hmm . Everything else we can really , we can really It is strange . um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's , it's a little <gap> but it , it's everywhere . Yeah . Well <disfmarker> So maybe we <disfmarker> Yeah . I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . <vocalsound> But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Or colour schemes . But they still need to um fit into people's decor though . We <disfmarker> Right . I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Yeah . The <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . The essence of strawberry . Yeah . Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Yeah . Instead of fruits and vegetables , Yeah . just <disfmarker> if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy <disfmarker> well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> But <vocalsound> may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . Yeah . But initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . <vocalsound> Yeah and like not , not <disfmarker> Tone it down . Yeah , I guess , yeah . Yeah . like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . yeah . Or banana-shaped . <vocalsound> One thing I was thinking though is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . Yeah . <vocalsound> So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog . Mm . Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> And , did you have any questions ? Pretty straightforward ? Yeah . Yeah um <disfmarker> Okay . Alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again . There you go . <vocalsound> Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I didn't for the first one . okay . But I have now . But it's still around right ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh , hopefully Okay . Where do you have to save it to ? . Project documents I think . Okay . Okay . I'm just trying to make this pop up now . Alright . Here we go . Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . So energy , we <disfmarker> Okay . oh . 'Kay . Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting . Does anyone know how to take it out of <disfmarker> Um , Just escape I think . The PowerPoint ? yeah . Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? Kinetic yeah . Yeah . Okay , so that's good . Are we going to have a backup ? Hmm . Or do we just <disfmarker> But would a backup really be necessary ? I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , if there is backup . and be bold and innovative , <vocalsound> and hope this works , and well hope that it works . Yeah . Yeah . I think <disfmarker> yeah . There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ? I think <disfmarker> no . So <disfmarker> I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . Yeah . It could even be one of our selling points . Go for it . It could be <vocalsound> Yeah . fully kinetic energy . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Environmentally conscious or something . Is everyone happy with that ? So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Hope so . <vocalsound> Alright , the next um decision is chip on print . I don't exactly know what that means . Um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so <disfmarker> Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ? Yeah , it was <disfmarker> Yeah . so that was without the L_C_D_ . So that means we're not doing the advanced . Yeah . So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? Yeah . I don Uh , so that's the simple . Mm-hmm . yeah . Yeah . Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ? Yeah possibly . So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . Yeah ? So it's a medium . Okay . So regular chip . That's called medium , or regular ? Regular sorry . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Regular chip . Oh , is regular not simple ? Yeah . Lighting . Yeah if we <disfmarker> It's for the lighting , yeah . because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well . Right right right . Okay , and cases . Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ? So th I think this is just like gonna be the <disfmarker> a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . Yeah . Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . Rubber . Yeah <vocalsound> Yeah . Plastic with rubber Plastic rubber coat . plastic coat . coating and interchangeable Interchangeable , yeah . um Still going for that . yeah , interchangeable plates . Yeah . Okay . User interface concept . This is your time to shine . We decided on the component . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um <vocalsound> PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component <disfmarker> Your screen ? Think it was called command interface . Was it <disfmarker> Oh , yeah . Yeah . Command interface , <gap> . The command inter Command interface . Ouch . The command line interface yeah . Did you say command line ? Yeah . Okay . Line interface . <vocalsound> Alright , and supplements . What's that all about ? Um , I think that is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the <disfmarker> in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? Um <disfmarker> You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . Mm-hmm . We haven't really decided what to do about that . Um , what are our choices here ? <vocalsound> Well it's just um w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ? You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ? The power . Volume . Mm-hmm . So pretty <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> just just the basic button functions . Yeah . Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have <disfmarker> May yeah . Tone , contrast , and things . Um , yeah . That's a bit <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That was on , um one of my presentations . About how often it was used . Do you remember that ? Yeah , it was minima Yep . well , it wasn't the l Yeah . Yeah , it was hardly ever used really . <vocalsound> I w <vocalsound> Should I bring it up ? Yeah . Yeah . That would be good . And most televisions will come with a remote . Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , Yeah , each television . Yeah . so <disfmarker> 'Kay , well we know we want numbers . The ch t Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . So tw twice every <disfmarker> once every two hours . Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . That's brightness , colour , tone , all that . Mm . You don't change that often , yeah . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , doesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote . Mm-hmm . Yeah , it does . Yeah , and different televisions . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of Yeah . So we're just going for power , channels , volume , changes like that . Volume . The other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um <disfmarker> Yeah . and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour . Mm . Yeah . Um , relevance of two . Oh . We have five minutes to finish our meeting . <vocalsound> Crap . Okay , um , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> let's do this fast . Um <disfmarker> Well that didn't some up on mine . Should we have audio ? It only comes up on mine usually . It w <vocalsound> it would seem silly if we'd <gap> having anything else , just have an audio button though . Oh . Do you know ? Yeah , I don't , I <disfmarker> it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we <disfmarker> But we know that everyone has this and it's the same . Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , I've <disfmarker> 'cause it , <vocalsound> mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . Yeah . This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power . Yeah , that's it . That could be a sales pitch . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah . Yeah . Simple and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah uh I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . Alright . Yeah . brilliant . Good . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . Wait a minute . Is that right ? Mm-hmm . Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product . Um , Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . Okay . Alright . So , anyone else have something to say ? Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Are we <disfmarker> seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? Now do you guys need <disfmarker> want an idea of how many uh <disfmarker> are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? Like f five different <disfmarker> Y Yeah . Yeah . <gap> five . <gap> . What I <disfmarker> What I was thinking <disfmarker> what do yous think of this ? Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . Mm-hmm . Like grapes . Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true . Like that's kind of fruity or something . Mm-hmm . That's just <disfmarker> Yeah . We can have a look at those ideas , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . Yeah . Something that your granny would want on her remote control . Um , and international tastes as well , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Not easy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Tricky . <vocalsound> A lot of things to consider . Hm . Yeah . Yeah . Lots of <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Alright . 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . Okay . Okay . 'Kay . Okay . Bye . Thank you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'll see you later . <vocalsound> Oh , what did I just do . Okay .
Okay . So welcome back . <vocalsound> What do <gap> <disfmarker> do we have to do ? <vocalsound> <gap> . So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your <disfmarker> in the map in the From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there . Then <vocalsound> I wanna hear from you , what you've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So <disfmarker> And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So <disfmarker> That's my task . Okay . Uh I've <disfmarker> Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I've save it on my computer , my presentation . Yeah on your computer , or the <disfmarker> But where ? What's the name ? Uh uh uh <disfmarker> What's the name of it ? It was about the working of the remote control . It's the technical function or the functional requirements . Nope . <vocalsound> Not a <gap> of <disfmarker> Wait . The working design . But I've saved it . Working design . But now I don't know where it is . Hmm . Working design . What is this ? Product documents . Yeah . And I import this until <disfmarker> On the desktop . Up . <gap> up . One more . Up . Up . Up . <vocalsound> Yes . My Documents . Nope . What the fuck is this ? Gone . <vocalsound> Well you <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Nah . Nah , nah , nah . <vocalsound> PowerPoint . Working design . Yeah that's the empty one . <vocalsound> And <disfmarker> I had one . Presentation of working design . Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is . Save as <gap> . <vocalsound> Uh it's <disfmarker> Desktop . Project <gap> . Project . Yeah . Okay . Well . Save . Okay . Very good . A little later but here it is . <gap> Okay . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> I don't get it . <vocalsound> Make it . Now have ten minutes to tell it . Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and <disfmarker> Okay . First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it <disfmarker> uh of it . Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you <disfmarker> I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , <vocalsound> um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now <gap> <disfmarker> And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult . <vocalsound> And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all <vocalsound> we all don't get it . My preferences ? It's uh <disfmarker> it won't be uh <disfmarker> We shouldn't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a <gap> <disfmarker> menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . That's <disfmarker> I think it's easier . Mm-hmm . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when <disfmarker> what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh <disfmarker> Oh oh . Yeah . Yeah . Two questions . The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ? If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . Okay so it's the size of the remote control . <gap> Just <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've <disfmarker> you need the television , wh which can use it . Yeah . But uh I think this <disfmarker> our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? Okay . Or is it also for other company <disfmarker> uh for other televisions ? I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . Then this is an option . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the Yeah but I don't <disfmarker> I think it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions . Mm . Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . Hmm . Okay . And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But <disfmarker> Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . Hmm . And also different things . Yeah . Good idea . Will this will this add to the cost ? Yes . Uh then it won't be <disfmarker> uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers . Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ? I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . Mm-hmm . Not much . 'Kay . Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . Just one . Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . <vocalsound> If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it . Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? Uh a p a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think . Yeah but there are also design cost . I don't think <disfmarker> When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Maybe . Would you change the cover ? I wi I won't . But maybe I think trendy people No . or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh <disfmarker> N yeah but <disfmarker> I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Yeah it's a good idea . But <disfmarker> If if it <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't <disfmarker> I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh <disfmarker> Okay . <gap> But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea . <vocalsound> Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it . No . Okay . Mm . You're the Project Manager . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Yes . That's it . That's clear . <vocalsound> Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer . Oh . That's me . Uh <disfmarker> Come on . <gap> . Ah . Yeah . Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh <disfmarker> for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh <disfmarker> and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh <disfmarker> We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . <vocalsound> Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ? We'll got back on that later . Okay yeah . Yeah well the <disfmarker> that was just on my mind . Yes . So uh I didn't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk <vocalsound> . 'Kay . 'Kay , thank you . Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . Okay . Uh um m Yeah . <vocalsound> Um yeah okay . This bit too far . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I <vocalsound> I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the <gap> we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say <gap> . I will <disfmarker> that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change <vocalsound> I think . <vocalsound> And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two <disfmarker> several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh <disfmarker> also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition . Mm-hmm . Um well th uh that's my second point . <vocalsound> Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um <disfmarker> You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . That were my findings . Okay thank you . Yeah . I have uh one question . If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . Yes . Yes . Mm-hmm . Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . No . Do you think ? No . And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . Like <disfmarker> No . No . So it's <disfmarker> Yeah , it's hard to uh get the younger group . Uh-huh . I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . Mm-hmm . Just the L_C_D_ ? Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> But we'll come back on that . Okay . Now <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh , go on . What d d d um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Uh we go <gap> <disfmarker> back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . <vocalsound> So not necessary . Next . Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . <vocalsound> Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site . <vocalsound> Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So <vocalsound> like you said , we need the <disfmarker> <gap> . Maybe it's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us . Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . Sorry ? The the requirements you just said , Yes . maybe we should first have a discussion about that . Yes , it's okay . I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . Yeah but we don't use it . It's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> new requirement . <vocalsound> So , it's not my requirement . 'Kay , we'll just have to do that . We have to do this . Okay . Okay . Okay sorry . No discussion about it . Then uh <disfmarker> No . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Unfortunately . So what controls do we need ? Who first ? Well a power button ? <vocalsound> Okay . Uh power . Uh the well um I think separate channels . So <disfmarker> Uh mm channel . But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something . Channel <disfmarker> Zero to nine . Uh volume . Volume . Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno Mine ? It's the functional requirements . Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the <disfmarker> Oh mine . Johan . That was the <disfmarker> the the the the <disfmarker> <gap> Technical . technical <disfmarker> Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine . To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down . Yeah that's the channel . D Yeah . Do we make a menu ? Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers . Mm yes . And <disfmarker> Hello ? That's ch <vocalsound> <gap> I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . Yes . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the <disfmarker> then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So Yes . But then we come to the costs . we need <disfmarker> N Yes . But if we have this <disfmarker> 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . So now we don't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ? Mute . Mute . Maybe in the menu ? Um <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh thing to do . Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . Yeah . Maybe more ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons . And <disfmarker> I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to <disfmarker> But now we have only the buttons . And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or <disfmarker> Yes . No that's for the next phase . Okay . Um <gap> <disfmarker> Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts . Okay . Okay . That's for the <disfmarker> So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it's time for lunch . Okay . Okay . Good idea . Thanks for coming . <vocalsound>
.. . Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . Mm , yeah . Maybe not . I didn't receive it yet <vocalsound> . Anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to <disfmarker> so that we get to know each other a little bit more . Mm-hmm . Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss <disfmarker> come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five . <vocalsound> <gap> so sh S so any any questions ? Is i <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> . Not at this point . <gap> not at this point . So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going <disfmarker> the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together . I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ? I think it <disfmarker> th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be <disfmarker> we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do Right . but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that <gap> and includes the <disfmarker> how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the <disfmarker> it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then Okay . <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for <vocalsound> for the project , specifically the whiteboard . Hmm . So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Why are you looking at me ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Would you like to go first ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do I have a choice ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . Oh , yeah , Right , okay . p put them in pockets . Cool . You don't have to hurry , Okay . we've got plenty of time . So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's got no eyes . Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do <gap> it's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I thought it might be a cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah I can see by the ears . Yeah . Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue . <vocalsound> Rabbits don't come in blue but you know . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um okay and I like it because it's small <vocalsound> and it's fluffy . <gap> Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay ? Excellent , Mm . and what's your what's your role within the team ? I am the um <disfmarker> I need my notebook , mm ooh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert <vocalsound> um so like I'm gonna be doing the <disfmarker> apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything <disfmarker> the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . um so yeah . And more about yourself , 'Kay . you're from ? Um I'm from Leicester , Mm-hmm . um second year . Um what else do you want to know ? <vocalsound> I like sports <vocalsound> um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> and uh <disfmarker> But not with rabbits . <vocalsound> not with rabbits , no no . Mm . And vets , I like vets as well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones . <vocalsound> Cool . Okay ? Excellent , Cool . <vocalsound> to match the rabbit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay . There's a <disfmarker> an <disfmarker> if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off . Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . <vocalsound> Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um <vocalsound> familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . <vocalsound> Oh , sorry , maybe I should have <disfmarker> shouldn't have said it beforehand but Mm . mm <vocalsound> hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's not bad at all . Ah it looks like a dog . <vocalsound> Yep . Okay . Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though . <vocalsound> Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> the other legs are on the other side . <vocalsound> Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . <vocalsound> Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . <vocalsound> Uh I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And where where are you from ? I'm from Estonia uh , yep . Estonia . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , <gap> . um so um in the different um <vocalsound> stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for <vocalsound> yeah , designing the technical functions of the um <vocalsound> um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . <gap> . <vocalsound> Okay , that's it . <vocalsound> Thank you . Okay <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> I'll do some <disfmarker> I'll rub the features <vocalsound> and let the drawing stay . <vocalsound> 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um <vocalsound> my favourite animal <disfmarker> one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good luck . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh this is going to be <disfmarker> They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns . Yeah , that'll do . Okay , so let let me draw the body first . <vocalsound> Mm . Big , round body , really skinny legs <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and they've got a long tail <vocalsound> and a long face . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's eating . <vocalsound> It looks like Eeyore . <vocalsound> And there is some grass there . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So this is what I like about <vocalsound> cows <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Horns , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , draw some horns . <vocalsound> they do not disturb anybody um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> they're kind of Buddhist in a way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So yeah , I like cows . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . <vocalsound> Yeah . Excellent . <vocalsound> Thanks . Thank you . Right , now now it's my turn obviously . <vocalsound> Okay , here's a space . That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It looks very very cute . <vocalsound> Yeah , I like the cow . I'm Jen . Yeah . <gap> Mm-hmm . Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . <vocalsound> I like <disfmarker> Mm . Is that a lizard ? No way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm . Wow . It's a gecko . Ah , a gecko , okay . Ah okay . Yeah . Is there a difference ? Is <disfmarker> a ar are they also like lizards or are they <disfmarker> They're <disfmarker> Yeah , they're yeah , they are l it's a kind of lizard . <disfmarker> mm-hmm . And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places <vocalsound> Ah . <vocalsound> and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house Uh-huh . <vocalsound> and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I hope you don't like snakes , do you ? I don't like snakes . I come from Australia Okay . <vocalsound> and we have nasty snakes . Mm-hmm . That's where I'm from , Australia . I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going Mm . and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . Wonderful . <vocalsound> Okay . Thank you . <vocalsound> So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . So , I've just thought <disfmarker> If you right click on it you can <disfmarker> yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally <vocalsound> as <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We've got <disfmarker> um we're planning to sell these remote controls for <disfmarker> let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is <disfmarker> let me just skip ahead to see <disfmarker> that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ? Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have <disfmarker> w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . Mm-hmm . I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that <vocalsound> are out of the ordinary . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was <disfmarker> that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . Something something new . Yeah , I was looking at the website , Mm . and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . Mm-hmm . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? Mm-hmm . So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . Uh-huh . Alright . You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly <disfmarker> I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? Mm-hmm . Mm . Okay . So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . But what do most people do ? They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , Sometimes they play a movie . Yeah , Yeah . but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . so there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , So , no . maybe to do <disfmarker> Yep . It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And then use the <disfmarker> So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine <vocalsound> Mm . and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Hmm . Excellent . 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep . um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . Mm-hmm . <gap> Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? Mm . <vocalsound> Uh we can aim for <disfmarker> I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , Mm-hmm . uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , Hmm . because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah . with l <vocalsound> learning , yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a <disfmarker> It's like those fancy websites that you can't access Hm-hmm . yeah . because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um <vocalsound> we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you're <disfmarker> you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , <vocalsound> Alright . you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , Mm-hmm . like you said at the start . Okay ? Okay . <vocalsound> Thanks for that . Thank you . Uh I'll see you in half an hour . <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> See you . Carry the laptops back again . Hmm . Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right well . Welcome to the <disfmarker> what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . Um okay , oh the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . Um So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals . Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda <disfmarker> so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . <vocalsound> Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . Uh-huh . Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , Yep , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . yeah , good , good . Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that Uh-huh . and it'll still understand . Yep , right . Um the logo is down down there um Uh-huh . Mm . S and <gap> has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes <disfmarker> the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything Yep , and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um . yep , mm-hmm . And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light <vocalsound> non-descript grey Mm . Uh-huh . Yep yep . so that people'll wanna buy the covers Yep . and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over . <gap> showing me age , Mm . I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , well I I didn't know that Yeah <gap> yeah . but yeah they're kind of <disfmarker> it's just kind of a rubbery <disfmarker> Uh-huh . and that way <disfmarker> Yeah . you know spongy like is something that people wanted Okay , yep , right . and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well Mm-hmm . But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers and <disfmarker> Okay . you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself Yep . just kinda stretch it over and it'll be fine . Okay , and it'll just stay on Yeah . good yeah . and then the buttons come through Yeah . and so <disfmarker> and then the <disfmarker> each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . Yep , right . Li that'll be <gap> the covers as well , yeah yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered <disfmarker> I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? Like that . Right . Okay <gap> for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically Yeah it could stand , yeah . <vocalsound> Oh . but uh uh <disfmarker> Well we could broaden the <disfmarker> broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that . <vocalsound> Yeah , uh no because <gap> particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item Yeah , <gap> standing . uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger Yeah , and uh <disfmarker> we could just widen it out uh Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option Mm . and if if say if they've got them um <gap> Mm . because <gap> actually have several <gap> upon the uh <disfmarker> Could have one for your stereo , one for your <gap> D_V_ player . Mm , yeah , yeah . Yeah , well . Yeah . Have to <disfmarker> if we just lengthen it I guess <vocalsound> Yeah Yeah , so it comes down to the base of the hand just kind of <disfmarker> but that that's uh <disfmarker> but uh and then flatten it out and could sit there . no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh <disfmarker> Or just make it little . Yeah , <vocalsound> mm . Somewhere like that Yeah . Yeah . yeah yeah , no no , I mean that's <disfmarker> these uh <disfmarker> so it just sort of <disfmarker> We might <gap> have to lengthen it Yeah I kinda had a a kinda <disfmarker> a natural kind of a idea so it kinda <disfmarker> your hand still holds it and have it there , Yeah . where it's like more of a kind of <disfmarker> like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that <gap> . Yeah . Bu yeah , kinda like that Yeah . kinda <gap> like a flower or a plant But uh yeah <disfmarker> but no th but the <disfmarker> yeah the the the <disfmarker> Mm . for the more natural kinda <disfmarker> <gap> . <vocalsound> The final product would actually stand up , yeah <vocalsound> . Yeah , yeah , yeah , I mean it it's uh <disfmarker> wouldn't <gap> fall over . wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . Yeah . But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details , Yeah , yeah . Yeah . I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on <gap> . Yeah . 'S a little longer . Wee <vocalsound> <disfmarker> and the <disfmarker> i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh <disfmarker> of you know looking different . Mm . Yeah . Um , so good that's that that's excellent . <vocalsound> Um right let us um What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um f finance . Um , now we're given a a clear design brief , uh if I <gap> get the uh spreadsheet up . Oh . Uh yeah , <vocalsound> just click there . <gap> . Uh the the maximise button . Oh right . Ah . Good , this is why we need to make these things simple <vocalsound> so that the uh the the the boss can understand . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now I've um <vocalsound> this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um we're <vocalsound> we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole <gap> the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . Um and uh we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um <vocalsound> slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings uh come in at <disfmarker> exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um <vocalsound> any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers Mm . so uh um you know the <disfmarker> if if if the management expect us to be techno <gap> again <gap> fail again <disfmarker> technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , Mm . so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um . Okay , uh . So um . Does anybody want to uh <disfmarker> uh Andrew do you want <disfmarker> what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation Evaluation . where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? The <vocalsound> the product or the project ? <vocalsound> The the the well the <disfmarker> I meant the product . Um , well well my presentation just now ? Yeah . Sure , uh can I get the <disfmarker> Oh sorry yeah um , mm . <vocalsound> Cheers . <vocalsound> Mm . More loud clicks in the microphone . <vocalsound> There we go , oh . Method of evaluation <vocalsound> testing the product was to just <gap> if it met all the criteria <disfmarker> all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard <vocalsound> um gauge our team response to these questions . So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . <vocalsound> Seven being a nice round number to work to . <vocalsound> Yeah . And then at the end just take an average Tr On for true and seven for flase . Yes <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So uh . <vocalsound> So , look at these questions . Is the device f flashy and fashionable ? Well I think most definitely . Yeah I think it is yeah . I'd say definitely a one yeah . So uh <disfmarker> and also uh technologically innovative ? Yes Yeah , defi yeah , yeah the voice technology indeed . Yeah . Easy to use ? I don't see we could've made it any easier . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh suitable for the consumer ? That was um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Totally . Yeah definitely . Yeah I think it made <disfmarker> we met all of the consumer Yeah . Yeah . wants . Uh is it complicated ? No . No . Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? <vocalsound> Uh functional ? Yeah . Yeah definitely . Yeah . Um . <vocalsound> Where are we ? <gap> found easily . We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function . <gap> yeah I mean that's that's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Does it take long to learn to use ? Shouldn't . No , not at all . Mm-hmm . And uh , what else ? <vocalsound> The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , <vocalsound> Less buttons well . Uh <disfmarker> so it must be . We we uh yeah it was our <disfmarker> it was a <disfmarker> Yeah we made an actual effort to <disfmarker> <gap> it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . Yeah . <gap> yeah . So yeah , um um . <vocalsound> Um will device appeal to all age groups ? I think it will Mm . because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so <disfmarker> I think so . Yeah , uh that's a good call , Mm . yeah . Well we had the we had the data <gap> saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , <vocalsound> the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . Mm . And it's it's it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> well I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so <disfmarker> I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups Mm . Yeah . just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus Yeah . Yeah . and the younger people tend to <disfmarker> would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . It will appeal f for dif for different reasons Yeah Yeah , yeah . I think just the simplicity of it but it's it's uh <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . yeah yeah and so I I <disfmarker> yeah I <disfmarker> not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , <vocalsound> Mm . why not ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's <disfmarker> <gap> in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement <vocalsound> <vocalsound> is t it's television only , Yep . it's it's simple to use , Mm-hmm . um it's it's it's within budget , Under the cost . Mm-hmm . Yep . um I <disfmarker> it's uh <disfmarker> yes an an any minor points we we we argue . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . So uh I I think we've done an amazing job Yep . in uh <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Well done us <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> coming up with what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . Eleven divided by <vocalsound> eleven's one so <vocalsound> equals average of one . Yeah , <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <gap> Need a need a calculator for that . And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . Excellent . Okay , <gap> nick the cable back then . I mixed up the colours a little bit . <vocalsound> Oh no that's <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think I <gap> all wrong . <vocalsound> Ooh . Right do um either of you want to uh say anything ? Uh . Mm . Mm . Before I uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ps I don't think so , I mean No . I think we worked well together <gap> . and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make Yeah . Yeah . and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus Mm-hmm . and <disfmarker> Well that's right , I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , Mm . Yeah , definitely . I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . Yeah . Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh <disfmarker> I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . Mm-hmm . Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself Mm . and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh Yeah . Yep . uh a new approach . Um are the costs within budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um Yep . Thank you very much indeed , Cool , thank you <vocalsound> , I think that <disfmarker> I think that's uh <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think we can go f for an early bath . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I call the meeting closed . Okay . Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .
Uh it fell off . One , two , three , four , yeah , we're ready . Okay . Welcome to this second meeting . Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . This is a meeting on functional design . Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . Um I did <disfmarker> took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's <disfmarker> I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . Okay ? Is this ap Yes . Oops . everybody agree with this ? Yes . Okay . Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . <vocalsound> Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting . And go to that one . Um as you can see it was this earlier today . Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting <vocalsound> Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? 'Kay . Uh I think so , Did I miss something ? we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . Mm-hmm . Yeah . I'm afraid I incorporated <vocalsound> that when I said who was present , but <disfmarker> yes , we did , <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay , I accept the minutes . and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures , but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . So um as a group I think we've <disfmarker> are <disfmarker> they're accepting the minutes . And uh <disfmarker> okay . Is that what we're supposed to say ? Yeah . Yeah , I do . Good . Um , then we'll move to the three presentations . Okay ? Okay . Okay . Mm we need to move this . Who wants to go f first ? <vocalsound> That's as far as it goes . Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . Oh it doesn't have any on , does it ? That's fine . Excellent , thank you . Oy , big loop under the table . She said we didn't need to screw it in . Okay . Okay , that looks good . It's doing its thing . There we are . Alright . Thank you very much . Um . One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar <disfmarker> of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players <disfmarker> although it makes immediate sense to <vocalsound> have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh <disfmarker> will only benefit from the positive feedback <vocalsound> from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um <vocalsound> fifty percent <disfmarker> I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this <vocalsound> there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . Could <disfmarker> can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've <disfmarker> Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . Now Mm-hmm . in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be Mm-hmm . um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Well I think we can <disfmarker> I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise <vocalsound> for the I go everywhere line . Mm . So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . So these market research uh uh questionnaires <vocalsound> looked into your your uh concern about technology <vocalsound> Hmm . and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . Okay . Now the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them <vocalsound> would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if <disfmarker> and you know , the the designers , Mm . but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five <disfmarker> Is that a large enough target market to target it ? Well , I I I think <disfmarker> especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh <disfmarker> In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? <vocalsound> Yeah . To <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um yes . Or eight million . Yes . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an <disfmarker> Hmm . that's a that's a very good question . <vocalsound> Yeah . I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , Um <disfmarker> but I think it's an interesting <disfmarker> Mm . I think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology . Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research Mm . Shall I go back ? on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , Yeah , yeah . and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . Yeah . How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ? Exactly . I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something <disfmarker> uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . <vocalsound> Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . You know , it's <disfmarker> I a and I think , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> you know <disfmarker> He must be w one of a s small population . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , no , you <disfmarker> Mm . Kate , you're exactly right there . <vocalsound> But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be <disfmarker> But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , Uh , mm . that's looking at age groups . Exactly . I <vocalsound> yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar <disfmarker> younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable , Leap . <vocalsound> Hmm . you know , um so <disfmarker> Mm . Okay , you had the other power channel . I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . <vocalsound> And this is this is also supported by the market research . Okay . <vocalsound> Thank you . That's my contribution . Alright . And we'll turn to the next presentation . I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in . And then press , what ? F F_N_ and F_ eight . Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top . Yeah , press them . And then w be patient . <vocalsound> Yeah , here we go . Tada . And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . Can I not just uh do each one in order ? I you can if you like , it it <disfmarker> that that just sets it up to do a p a p There we are . Yay . That ? no that one , that one there . That ? Left , left a bit , left a bit , That ? that one , yep . Right , technical functions design . Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . Okay . Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . T_V_ only . So these are two models of existing remote controls . Uh the one on the left seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . <vocalsound> Ugh . It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has <disfmarker> seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control Hmm . where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has <disfmarker> it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an an enter function where you can access <disfmarker> it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . Mm . And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just <disfmarker> want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons Okay . o I was thinking something <disfmarker> some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . Alright . Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech um recognition possibility . Okay . Any uh thing else you wanna add ? No . Okay . But we could go back to the pictures of the <disfmarker> uh , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , Or if <disfmarker> but <vocalsound> maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . Yeah . Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say . Okay then . Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that <disfmarker> your <disfmarker> the one on the right as a as a basis . Hmm . Whiteboard session . I think the white <disfmarker> that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Definitely less cluttered and <disfmarker> I mean but still it's <disfmarker> Sorry It's there I was just <disfmarker> but it's <disfmarker> I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . <vocalsound> The the style of these is terrible . Yeah . <vocalsound> I I I really think we need to uh not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . <vocalsound> The ergonomics , the way it fits in your <disfmarker> Hmm . Yeah . But <disfmarker> <gap> So that's that for now . Cheers . Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . Okay . Still , I'll do without that . Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . <vocalsound> Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , <vocalsound> and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . <vocalsound> And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and <disfmarker> which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the <disfmarker> which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now I would have hoped <disfmarker> I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . I would have have hoped to um do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . <vocalsound> So we want an energy source which is there . And we've got to think about what that might be . Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Hmm-mm . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . <vocalsound> Um and then we have the the user interface . Oops . And the main components in there are the the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . <vocalsound> Thank you . Hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . Right . But those things <disfmarker> as long as we can get those components , the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of <disfmarker> what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . Mm-hmm . The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um <disfmarker> because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million of 'em , Mm . um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , you just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need <disfmarker> gonna need to hit . Do we have um ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? Whoop . Okay . <vocalsound> Isn't that your job ? Because then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . No , <vocalsound> the chip composer marketing . <vocalsound> Oh right . Oh no , the chip composer sender . Mm . What they cost . Um , I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna <vocalsound> give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , I I don't believe I know , um . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , Mm-hmm . the <disfmarker> which is pretty much the same as these existing models , just maybe a little bit more inspired , Inspired ? Mm . but basically just the same . Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . You could <disfmarker> you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , Well that has another element , which are <disfmarker> which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you <disfmarker> then it has a place . Mm . You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah . Yeah , but it also has a place , so <disfmarker> And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . exactly . Mm . <vocalsound> But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . <vocalsound> That's a really good idea . Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . <vocalsound> I'll do some research for the next meeting . <vocalsound> Well Okay . it's better than my idea about solar , probably . <vocalsound> Uh yeah . Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . but <disfmarker> Mm . Well Depen it is just so annoying how <disfmarker> It would have to sor store up the energy Mm . Yeah . Yeah , I guess . and then use it . Solar can do that . We may be talking quite heavy then . Yeah . M yeah , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much . Mm-hmm . No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably <disfmarker> I mean it might cost more to <disfmarker> at first to develop and to install , Mm-hmm but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer Mm-hmm . and So you know f do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? Definitely , 'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh <vocalsound> the <vocalsound> loss and breakage of um remotes , Mm . how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live , Mm . Mm . Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . <vocalsound> exactly . Yeah . So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is <disfmarker> And the dock could look very fancy Exactly . and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . Mm . Hmm . 'Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Okay . Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . Well I I brought up some <disfmarker> exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? Mm . You know , Yeah , these are the <disfmarker> Mm . I was wondering that , because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy <vocalsound> something new , <vocalsound> I I s usually put more money than brains . Yeah , exactly . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment . are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , Yeah . <vocalsound> It might be good to know I don't know . Yeah . um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ? Mm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . Right , good point . Yeah , yeah okay , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , good point . Yeah . That's probably more what it is . What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? <vocalsound> Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to to go for the the manufacturers . Mm-hmm . Okay . Right . <vocalsound> We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , are we ? <vocalsound> Probably not . Mm . Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n <vocalsound> definitely we wanna be inspired that the current <vocalsound> styles are just plain awful . Yeah . Do we need <disfmarker> um let me <disfmarker> Is that agreeable to everyone ? Br actually , um Mm-hmm . the enter key <disfmarker> I have a chart here that I didn't include . Um Mm-hmm . Do you want the gizmo ? yeah , which might <disfmarker> Throw some light on that . Th yeah , th those are <disfmarker> <vocalsound> felt like had a lot of charts . <vocalsound> Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . <vocalsound> Okay , I I <disfmarker> my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only <disfmarker> just really in terms of streamlining . Ah . Mm-hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . <vocalsound> Exactly . Again , you know , Is that okay with you ? thinking of menus or <disfmarker> Sorry , I was miles away . Would that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> H how does that work ? <vocalsound> Um well I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . How <disfmarker> so so how does that work , uh-huh . how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um <disfmarker> so you press power after you've Then you'd have to have an off te off key . um <disfmarker> well I was thinking maybe you <disfmarker> to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , Okay , yep , mm-hmm . and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . Mm . It's not getting a bit complicated ? Could granny do this , Well <disfmarker> or are we just not aiming at granny ? Or y yeah . Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Who's got an iPod then ? <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> I don't <disfmarker> Mm . Okay . um I wish . Anyway , uh <vocalsound> that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions people have made , what's most important . It's definitely channel , volume , power . Mm . Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , Exactly . like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . Exactly . I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , Yeah . so um I would say that they are definitely less relevant . Okay , well . Okay . So Thanks for looking at that . I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . Mm-hmm . We don't wanna outsmart <disfmarker> As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . <vocalsound> I just joined that set last week . Hmm . Um <vocalsound> first grandchild arrived . Congratulations . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh . Um so are we agreed then of those things ? And let's go back to agenda D and hook me up . Mm . This oughta be fun . It probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like a g mess . Come on . Uh it lost it off here . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Oh you're fine . It's fine . No , it was up there , but I couldn't see it down here . Mm . This time it should be both . There we go . How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ? Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to <disfmarker> Ah okay , five minutes to finish , it toggles through , thank you a lot for telling me . yeah . <vocalsound> I think you have to cycle through . Um right , Yeah . we're ready to close . Um <gap> will be completed q questionnaire , um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . Um your individual assignments are for um Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching . Um and each of us will get help from our coach . Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? Yes . <vocalsound> Sounds good . Okay . Then that's the end of this meeting . And I hope that's good enough for her <vocalsound> to tell her that's the end . Okay ? Okay . We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down Alright , and marked them . well that's fine then . Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . Okay . Um and you'd mentioned <disfmarker> I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it <disfmarker> they were <disfmarker> Okay . it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself <disfmarker> Um the teletext is outdated , So we're still in meeting , aren't we ? <vocalsound> Yeah , the internet is important , I think I've <disfmarker> it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um Okay . which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph . Mm . Sorry , what what actually are these <disfmarker> is that the yellow and black ? It doesn't tell me . Mm . From their <disfmarker> I'll just use it from their website . Mm-hmm . Okay ? <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Right . Thank you .
Hi Kate . <vocalsound> Just just carry on . <vocalsound> Okay , carry on . <vocalsound> Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have <disfmarker> the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , <vocalsound> um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay . <vocalsound> Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting <disfmarker> the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of <disfmarker> going after <disfmarker> going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for <disfmarker> be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um <vocalsound> the corporate image . So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . <vocalsound> Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? Yeah . Yes . Mm-hmm . Okay . Right . So we're ready to close that and go back to our <disfmarker> That one . Right . We're up to the point of the <disfmarker> Go back . Um <vocalsound> the three presentations . So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . Is that okay ? Is that alright with everybody else ? Yep . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Especially since Kate asked to be last . <vocalsound> Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or <vocalsound> S_A_R_H_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I respond to either . No worries . You respond to whatever you get , huh ? <vocalsound> Okay . Um , did you do your <disfmarker> Hit <disfmarker> Yeah , <gap> Ah , there it is . Ta-da . Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . Right . Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . Mm 'kay . But I'm going to move on to more interesting um <vocalsound> more vibrant things . <vocalsound> So , I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh <disfmarker> the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch . <vocalsound> And <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . <vocalsound> Sorry . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , <vocalsound> so you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . What's hot , fruit and veg . Spongy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is really interesting change from past years , <vocalsound> because it is much more organic , Mm . um some would say approachable . <vocalsound> And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . So . <vocalsound> I also did a little research on um <vocalsound> what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . Fancy . Functional is out . And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , <vocalsound> you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically <vocalsound> superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . Ease of use . Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . So I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of <vocalsound> fruit <vocalsound> fruit themed sleeves . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think that's a good idea . <vocalsound> Y yeah , you know <disfmarker> Don't you ? <vocalsound> Yes . It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . Exactly . <vocalsound> Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . <gap> you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . Mm . They could be <disfmarker> ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . Um it could actually <disfmarker> the sleeve could <vocalsound> take up a lot of the <vocalsound> development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . So what we're talking about is changing . this concept . Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's what's hot on the catwalks . <vocalsound> So , this is my <disfmarker> This is what I'm thinking . Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh-huh mm . In most families , don't <disfmarker> isn't the remote <disfmarker> is a remote . Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it <disfmarker> we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the <disfmarker> someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . Mm . <vocalsound> So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . <vocalsound> Yeah . W and <vocalsound> plus I think <disfmarker> Mm . Well <vocalsound> Uh yeah . actually some households do have three and four T_V_s <gap> Yeah . and they would have a remote for each one , so . Yeah . So this is an idea and I I <disfmarker> you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This <vocalsound> spongy fruit and veg . Yeah , Thanks . I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . <vocalsound> Alright . Yep . Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid . Hmm . <vocalsound> And as for as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I just have my ear to the market , guys . <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is this <gap> to the market <gap> ? Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , Is spongiest , yeah . yeah . That would add <disfmarker> I was thinking titanium myself . I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just <disfmarker> I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , Mm-hmm . and they're also minimalist and shiny . <vocalsound> They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . I think many of us would associate those with fancy . Something else we could do is uh call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . We could call it uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The name . Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? <vocalsound> Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So <disfmarker> Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management Yeah , but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ? and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product . Yeah . <vocalsound> That , you know , that might be <disfmarker> Let's delegate . <vocalsound> Wo would that be agreeable ? And then we could keep it titanium . Yeah . <vocalsound> W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um <disfmarker> maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . <vocalsound> Yeah , maybe . Or <disfmarker> Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ? I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . Okay , we'll move the <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You can even have them in different flavours as well . <vocalsound> So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , Yeah . Or s or smelly . Scratchy yeah . Scratch and sniff . <vocalsound> Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . <vocalsound> Right , well It's hot on the streets , guys . I I I think some of this um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . <vocalsound> So um I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . I really need a pen or something but uh <disfmarker> does my mouse work ? No . Um <disfmarker> oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? Mm . Right . This is this is the a a <vocalsound> a remote that's been opened up Mm . and that's the the back of the interface . And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . Um <vocalsound> and we <disfmarker> that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver . So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um <vocalsound> uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um <vocalsound> doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . We can have a hand <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A wind-up . sorry <disfmarker> a wind-up , yeah , <vocalsound> which I think is quite an interesting concept for a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> sorry <disfmarker> for a remote control , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but i it maybe is <disfmarker> doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , Alright . <vocalsound> Remember , we only have forty minutes where um <vocalsound> you you actually get the energy by moving the device , Mm . which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . Hmm . You have to <disfmarker> it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , <vocalsound> it'll work . Hmm . Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . Mm . Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , <vocalsound> or titanium . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um <vocalsound> I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , Hmm . and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . Hmm . Okay , what does the interface look like ? Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . <vocalsound> Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , Hmm . so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . <vocalsound> Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it <disfmarker> the technology is there . And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it <disfmarker> that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . <vocalsound> Mm . And <disfmarker> well I I think we've got two options . We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which <vocalsound> means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um that <vocalsound> may or may not be a good thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sorry . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . <vocalsound> So , thank you . That sounds good . Any idea <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . Um do you have any idea if if this could <disfmarker> if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? <vocalsound> Yeah , I'm afraid I don't have that information available . Um manufacturing didn't actually give <disfmarker> attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . Hmm . Hmm . Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . But I think the important thing might be to choose one . <vocalsound> Yeah mm-hmm . You know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry . That's uh <disfmarker> Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . <vocalsound> Banana ? <vocalsound> Alright , well let's see then . But um I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . Yeah . It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . Yeah . That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . But <disfmarker> yeah , I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , Yeah . we can't do anything fancier . Hmm . Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what <disfmarker> well , <vocalsound> my extensive presentation <vocalsound> on what sort of interfaces are available . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . Yep . Thank you , Kate . Thank you , Kate . Mm . You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . So <vocalsound> so mine's a bit pointless . Right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ? Yes . <vocalsound> There we go . I don't have it on mine though . <vocalsound> Oh I think um Florence resolved it by I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's <disfmarker> it'll <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Do it again . F_ eight again . Keep doing it until you get it in both <disfmarker> you get it there , I think it <disfmarker> yeah , you you will do an <disfmarker> you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both . Should I do it again ? Maybe . Yeah . <vocalsound> This time it should come up both . <vocalsound> Right then . I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , Okay . just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . Mm-hmm . Mm . Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . <vocalsound> Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , which <disfmarker> Well , I couldn't find a <disfmarker> the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . Hmm . So I was thinking that uh <vocalsound> um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um Hmm . and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do <disfmarker> you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up <vocalsound> and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , Mm . um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . So <vocalsound> what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , <vocalsound> just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . Hmm . And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , Mm . it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching . Yeah . And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea . And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . Yeah . Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . <vocalsound> Hmm . Uh <vocalsound> then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause um <vocalsound> otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting <disfmarker> building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well . And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . It's a duplication . Like There is that . when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , just a little menu showing <disfmarker> yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . Mm-hmm . I don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer . <vocalsound> Um . But as for actually arranging them <disfmarker> let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right . Mm-hmm . Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I can't quite d uh describe it . <gap> you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . Yeah , see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Right . so you pick your menu and then <disfmarker> your different options and when when you click on each one , it <disfmarker> you can go into a new menu for that . I'm getting a bit uh specific here . <gap> Really we'd have to use something to show you , Yeah . I think I think that's a g nice clean design , but <disfmarker> it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology . <vocalsound> To uh m make it . If <disfmarker> I don't think I can get it up on the screen . Ah here we go . Right . Oh nice . Um <disfmarker> Hmm . Well , the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . Huh . It does scroll , Yeah . but it is hugely complicated . Mm . What else have we got ? Wow . Them , they're terrible . But they all have this this feature of this uh <disfmarker> It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , It's a selection wheel . which I think is a really good idea . But we can implement it with simple push buttons , Yeah , which is much cheaper . like up , down , left and right . Which is good . And then and then <disfmarker> Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , <vocalsound> uh and then also <vocalsound> when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . Okay . So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . Okay . And that's it . <vocalsound> Look at look at this one . In fact <disfmarker> Oh that's really nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do you think with um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Might take up your whole living room . <vocalsound> It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the <disfmarker> something reminiscent of the child's remote . Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . You know , we could call <vocalsound> like a fruit name , Possibly . Yeah . Hmm . but it would be a little more abstract . Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather <disfmarker> if you feel <disfmarker> if you like the spongy <disfmarker> That also is possible . Mm-hmm . I'm just just throwing out ideas . Just <disfmarker> Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow . Hmm . Yeah . I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? This is actually the volume up and down , but <vocalsound> they both say V_ on them , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . which , when you first look at it , <vocalsound> you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , Mm-hmm . Yeah . but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , Hmm . Mm-hmm . so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . Yeah . Hmm . Nice . Good point . But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . Mm 'kay . But then , that's complicated . I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . So <vocalsound> let's <disfmarker> Mm . Right . They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which <disfmarker> the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . <vocalsound> The <disfmarker> You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . Mm . Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information . Okay . I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry Mm 'kay . I don't figures on the difference in cost . What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , you don't even notice um that it's there . It sounds great . I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . Hmm . It could tie in with the fanciful design as Hmm . Yeah . uh , you know , <vocalsound> 'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving . isn't it ? It's like <disfmarker> yeah , a good selling point . So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . Be But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . It costs . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . And and how much you do have to keep it moving , Mm . Yeah . 'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity . Mm-hmm . But I could market that as a um as a <vocalsound> a <disfmarker> I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . Mm . <vocalsound> Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Hmm . True , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly . Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well . Mm-hmm . You know , Yeah . kind of the <disfmarker> Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . <vocalsound> Oh right , okay , Um <vocalsound> the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . I'd <disfmarker> that that's something I maybe should have covered . Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique Oh . um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative . <vocalsound> Okay . I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built What about the ca yeah . Oh , the way we <gap> uh-huh . and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . Oh , okay . Um what about the case ? I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , <vocalsound> and I think we've discussed not having titanium . One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ? Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold . so it's <disfmarker> yeah . What about you ? Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy Yeah , s thick spongy cover , Mm . Kind of like an internal egg . Cover . so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . <vocalsound> Plastic inside . Yeah . <vocalsound> Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac Yeah . I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh <disfmarker> sounds like a nice idea if it is . Yeah . Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , Hmm . <vocalsound> And with sports on television . Okay . and <disfmarker> You know . <vocalsound> Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . I su I should I should r <gap> I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to <vocalsound> finish with . Then I'll just say I support either <disfmarker> from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . Okay , and it says interface . What type and what supplements ? Just copy the one on the left . <vocalsound> No um a scroll <disfmarker> Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that Yeah , I'd <disfmarker> like push buttons with <disfmarker> that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on . So push buttons <disfmarker> Okay , um <vocalsound> that's that . Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew . <vocalsound> And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation . No , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually . No we can't , actually . Oh . Oh my , I'm sorry . That's why I was looking over your shoulder Oh , okay . Sorry about that . missed that one . This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . Ah , ta-da . Now it's gone again . <vocalsound> Ah . You know , I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . <vocalsound> Yes , because I can't even see mine . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , Oh yes . these are <vocalsound> the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , Mm . uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product <vocalsound> evaluation . Um the two of you <vocalsound> get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . Great . Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . Sounds good . <vocalsound> Anything else we need to do ? <vocalsound> I don't think so . Go to it . <vocalsound> Play-Doh . And that's the end of this meeting . That's for her benefit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's really all I got , guys . <vocalsound>
Okay Right <vocalsound> Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . Um <vocalsound> and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . Mm-hmm . Um so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , I'm Laura and I'm the project manager . <vocalsound> Do you want to introduce yourself again ? Great . Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer . Okay . And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface . expert . Great . Okay . <vocalsound> Um so we're designing a new remote control and um <disfmarker> Oh I have to record who's here actually . So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ? And you all arrived on time . Um yeah so des uh <vocalsound> design a new remote control . Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . Um and so there are three different stages to the design . Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . What did you get ? Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is <vocalsound> . Mm-hmm . Designing a remote control . Mm-hmm . That's about it , didn't get anything else . Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's it . Is that what everybody got ? Yeah . Did you get the same thing ? Okay . Yeah . Um . So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . And repeat that process three times . Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . Um . <vocalsound> So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . So who would like to go first ? I will go . That's fine . Very good . <vocalsound> Alright . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This one here , right ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Very nice . Alright . My favourite animal is like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A beagle . <vocalsound> Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? Yeah . Yeah . Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . <vocalsound> So this is blue . Blue beagle . My family's beagle . Right . <vocalsound> Lovely . <vocalsound> <gap> Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , <vocalsound> I'm gonna be up there with them . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Cool . <vocalsound> There's too much gear . <vocalsound> You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . <vocalsound> Ok oh <vocalsound> we do we do Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . Okay . I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . Ach <gap> why not <disfmarker> Boy , let me tell you . <vocalsound> We might have to get you up again then . <vocalsound> I don't know what mine is . I'm gonna have to think on the spot now . Impressionist . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Can't draw . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is that a whale ? <vocalsound> Um . Yeah . Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . Allergic to animal fur , Ah . so um fish was a natural choice . Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . They come in and go <vocalsound> eat everything in sight . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright . And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . Mm . Okay . God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . Um . Superb sketch , by the way . <vocalsound> Tail's a bit big , I think . <vocalsound> I was gonna choose a dog as well . <vocalsound> But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . Yep . M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> That doesn't really look like him , actually . He looks more like a pig , actually . Ah well . I see a dog in there . <vocalsound> Do you ? Yep . Oh that's very good of you . <vocalsound> Now I see a rooster . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh . What kind is it ? Um he's a mixture of uh various things . Um and what do I like about him , um <disfmarker> That's just to suggest that his tail wags . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um <vocalsound> uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can <disfmarker> doesn't take up too much space . <vocalsound> Um and uh <disfmarker> And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , <vocalsound> which is quite amusing , so <disfmarker> Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner <vocalsound> and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . Hmm . <vocalsound> It's an after dinner dog then . Yeah , so uh <disfmarker> Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . Yeah , maybe . Maybe . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right , um where did you find this ? Just down here ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . 'Kay . Um , can we just go over that again ? Sure . Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . Okay . So cost <disfmarker> like production cost is twelve fifty , All together . but selling price is <disfmarker> is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf . Um I dunno . I imagine <disfmarker> That's a good question . Our sale our sale anyway . I imagine it probably is our sale actually Yeah , okay okay . because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um . Okay . Mm-hmm . Alright . But I <disfmarker> I don't know , I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? Yes . <vocalsound> Think it will ? Mm-hmm . Um . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Hmm . Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . Oh yeah , Um f frequencies or something regions and stuff , yeah . Yeah . um as well as uh characters , Okay . um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . Hmm . Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be <disfmarker> Um . I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . I don't know . Yeah . It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . So , possibly . Yeah . Okay . And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so <disfmarker> What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? Just a chara just a characteristic of the <disfmarker> Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? Just <disfmarker> Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows , Aye , I see what you mean , yeah . something like that , yeah . Marketing . <vocalsound> Good marketing thoughts . Yep . Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um . Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , Mm . thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , Yeah . something other than just standard . Um so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the <disfmarker> thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . Uh-huh . Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Mm-hmm . Or no , is it as much as that ? Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . Yep . Yeah , I'd say so , yeah . Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um . No . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . Mm-hmm . Um right , okay . Let me just scoot on ahead here . Okay . Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other Thin No , actually . That would be useful , though , other <vocalsound> <disfmarker> wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now . Yeah . Hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . Yeah , yeah . It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . Oh . It just comes along . Five minutes to end of meeting . Oh , okay . We're a bit behind . Do you know what I mean ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Like so sort of like how do you Yeah . I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . I know um <disfmarker> My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . But <disfmarker> Right . Right . So um for them it was just how many devices control . Okay so <disfmarker> Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses <disfmarker> Yeah . Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , I think so . do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones , Mm-hmm . everything , agenda . So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , <vocalsound> Yeah . such as the lighting in your house , or um <disfmarker> Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Yeah , yeah . Oh that's a good idea . An So extra functionalities . Yeah . Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them . Mm-hmm . So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . But each one's got its own little Hmm . part . Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . Um I'll just check we've nothing else . Okay . Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? And you keep losing them . You keep losing them . Mm . Okay . Finding them is really a pain , you know . Mm . Mm . I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . or it's kicked under the table . Yeah . Yeah . W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . Yeah . You know . That's just really good id Yep . There <disfmarker> I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? Uh , <vocalsound> Dunno . sure . <vocalsound> Okay maybe . <vocalsound> I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ <vocalsound> and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . My goodness . And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . Still feels quite primitive . Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S Maybe like a touch screen or something ? Something like that , yeah . Okay . Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . Uh-huh , okay . Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer . 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having <disfmarker> It looks better . You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . Yeah . Um , nicer materials and might be Okay . Okay . be worth exploring anyway . Uh . Right , well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it Yep . so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually <disfmarker> what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess . Okay . Um . <vocalsound> Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . <vocalsound> And uh and that's the end of the meeting . So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so <disfmarker> Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here , Mm-hmm . um , do we <disfmarker> We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , Uh-huh , yeah . right ? Mm-hmm . Well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? Th Okay , I I don't know . well just very quickly 'cause this <disfmarker> we're supposed to finish now . Yep . Um I guess that's up to us , Yeah , sure . I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , Okay . so um , you know <disfmarker> I think one factor would be production cost . Okay , yeah . Because there's a cap there , Yeah . so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um . Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay . Yeah . I think that that's the main factor . Okay . Okay . Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um Alright . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , uh thank you all for coming . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Cool .
Yep . Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . <vocalsound> Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . <vocalsound> Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . The prototype discussion . The prototype yeah . Do you need a <disfmarker> this ? No . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Can try to plug that in there There is our remo <gap> the banana . <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . Um but it would be held in such a fashion , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . Very nice . And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um <vocalsound> that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really . Is there anything you want to add ? Right . That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , Yeah . Doesn't make much make much difference . so <disfmarker> yeah , Mm-hmm . You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . you have some rub yeah . Exactly , <gap> use both . Might as well think about <disfmarker> T the actual thing might be smaller . Th think about the button as well . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like either put either one <gap> one on either side or What but what's that button ? not do it at all . Just the on and off . It's a quick on-off button . Uh , 'kay . <vocalsound> That's um yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that . 'Kay . Right ? Um that's not um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . Yeah . You wanna play with that over there . There you go . <vocalsound> It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , Would you like to uh <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> Right . Pretty impressive . Well done . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Kind of a banana . And whether or not it would fall into the cost <gap> everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . Well luckily we are going to find out . Or not luckily . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I do . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us . Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that . <gap> . Okay . So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . Mm . Yeah . So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . <vocalsound> I would <gap> . It's bright . It's bright . It's <disfmarker> It still has your traditional black . It's curved . It's not <disfmarker> there's no sharp <vocalsound> angles to it . Yep , not angular . Mm . I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . <vocalsound> However the colour , we don't have a say in that . Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . <vocalsound> Some people might say it . Yeah . That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . Mm . So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . That's true . <vocalsound> Yep . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . Yeah . But <disfmarker> Yeah something more modern to go <disfmarker> Right . a a modern colour to go with the modern form . Right . It's different . You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . Um okay so , do you think , since we <disfmarker> This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? Does that sound good ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> What do you think ? Three ? Four ? I would say Five ? four . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Four is fair . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Very non-committal , four . Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ? It's very intuitive , I think yeah . Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . <vocalsound> S give it a one . One , Yeah . 'kay . Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? Uh yeah . I'd say that <disfmarker> 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls <gap> most common , which are channel and volume . Right . Mm-hmm . And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . S scrolling through and selecting a few . Right . So one ? So that's a one . Yeah ? <vocalsound> I think that's a one . Okay . Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints . Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's bright yellow . <vocalsound> Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned . So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could <disfmarker> Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . Oops . And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . Hmm . That's gonna be a difficult shape to <disfmarker> Well what <disfmarker> And it is quite bright and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? S Okay . Uh <disfmarker> I mean you know <gap> loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . Yeah . You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . That's true . Mm . But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . Mm . Oh yeah . Yeah . You probably <disfmarker> Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then Yeah . Mm . I'd say two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . Yeah . Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . Yeah . We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . Annoying alarm or something ? Yeah . It's it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So it can't be that Um the <disfmarker> it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , expensive . Some sort of proximity <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much . Yeah . So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your <disfmarker> stick it behind your T_V_ and the other <disfmarker> <gap> stick it on the T_V_ <gap> . <vocalsound> Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . That'd be tough then . <vocalsound> Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So . Are we adding one of these two features ? Let's add one of those features and say yes . <vocalsound> <gap> gonna say <disfmarker> okay . Okay . So we're <vocalsound> back to a one ? Or a two ? Two . Two . Two , 'kay . Two . Okay . Are we technologically innovative ? Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'd say so . <vocalsound> Uh don't get many mo remote controls with It's all just <disfmarker> screens on . It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah it's stolen technology . From iPod yeah . <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But we have <gap> . But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . But for remotes <disfmarker> right yeah . Course that wasn't really <disfmarker> Fa right right right . we were kinda forced to take that colour . Two ? Three ? <gap> 'cause it's stolen . I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . <vocalsound> No maybe not . Yeah not really . But how many remotes do you see like this ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not so many . If we added the screaming factor <vocalsound> then we go up . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . <vocalsound> Um I would say we're probably at four . Really ? Okay . <vocalsound> That's gonna hurt us . <vocalsound> Okay . Um spongy material ? Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . We have some spongy , yeah . Yeah as much as as needed , I think . 'Kay . It's not a one though . No . One would be the whole thing Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side <disfmarker> the bottom <disfmarker> the underneath on the back . to fold and stuff . Yeah . Yeah . So that's a four at most . Probably a four at most . And lastly , Possibly even a five . did we put the fashion in electronics ? <vocalsound> Y yes . I'd say we did . Yeah . If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . <vocalsound> More <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , On the <disfmarker> It's true . Yeah . but it definitely is <disfmarker> Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . <gap> . 'Kay . Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen . Seventeen divided by s <gap> . Seven is <disfmarker> Eight . Two point <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> two point four ? Is that some long division ? No . Well I haven't done math in years . Something . What two <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I dunno . Just , I'm sure there's a <gap> . Okay we'll say two point four two . Right ? How does that look ? I'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's been a while . No I can't do long <gap> very impressive . And what what is the acceptable criteria ? Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? Oh no . They just told me to <vocalsound> <vocalsound> pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it <vocalsound> basically . <vocalsound> Alright then . So that's that . Okay . Well , let's see . <vocalsound> Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . But we do . Okay . Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that . It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . Oh my god . Okay . Two point four two basically . Yeah we'll go with that . <vocalsound> Fifty percent , you're kidding . Not too shabby . So I have here an <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> P We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well . <vocalsound> Charge about three hundred quid for it . <vocalsound> Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . Okay , so <disfmarker> It's too much . Well let's see . Um <disfmarker> The f the <disfmarker> Wonder if I can make this <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> What the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh it won't let me do that . Okay . Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . <vocalsound> I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories . Battery . We have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . Okay so <disfmarker> Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? <vocalsound> Probably some e either two or four . Two . Two ? <vocalsound> Like it . <vocalsound> At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month . <vocalsound> Excellent . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> They won't know until after they bought it . <vocalsound> This is consumerism . Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . <gap> . We're advanced chip are we ? That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . 'Kay , <gap> we have one of those . 'Kay then the case is a <disfmarker> Probably it's double curved . Double curved , yes . Case materials are Plastic . plastic . Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . N no . Is that right or is it just one ? No that's just one . Maybe it's one because of the <disfmarker> It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . 'Kay . Yeah <gap> yeah . Right . <vocalsound> I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . Exactly , right . Oh . Special colour ? That's not a special colour . Bright yellow . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display . S S <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> Yeah . So we actually have the L_C_D_ display <vocalsound> And then <disfmarker> and then is it the integrated or is it <disfmarker> I'd say the integrated . Yes unfortunately . Yeah . 'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ? Mm . Um special form ? Special material . We could of course make the buttons wood . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Say mahogany or so <vocalsound> It'd look really lovely . Or titanium . Mm-hmm or titanium . <vocalsound> Yeah . They cost us all the same . <gap> remote control <gap> . Uh just <disfmarker> Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . No that's getting a bit tiny . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . I'd ignore that . Leave it blank . Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five . Which I believe is Yeah that's too much . by three Euros over . It's hard to believe . So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . If it w <vocalsound> What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . <vocalsound> And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . Yeah <vocalsound> 'cause the <disfmarker> Well 'cause we have to have both right ? Yeah . I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . Yeah . You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . Mm-hmm . So s yeah let's take away the <disfmarker> Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , Yeah . Yeah . if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . Right . So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? Uh that is possible yeah . Right . We may not need it . There you go . Well there we go . Perfect . There we go . <vocalsound> Perfect . Twelve point five . Okay . So we just remove our <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Screen . <vocalsound> screen here . Make it a bigger dial . <vocalsound> Easier to use . Even easier to use then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , the <disfmarker> Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Back to the design room boys . <vocalsound> So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> there you go . <gap> central ? What's the blue part ? That was just <disfmarker> Oh that's the batteries . Oh that's just <disfmarker> we ran out of yellow . <vocalsound> yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> There you go There you go . . Oops . Even simpler . <vocalsound> Looks more like a banana . Yeah . For all those fruit lovers out there . There you go . One more criteria . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes . Yeah . <vocalsound> Next slide . Project evaluation . Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . Um <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> I guess that <disfmarker> Let's see here . I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But I'd like to hear your thoughts . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Fair enough . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Trying to fill in some time there . <vocalsound> Uh h what did you think of our project process ? I think we did <disfmarker> Great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> yeah I think we did quite well . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Good . Good teamwork <gap> . <vocalsound> Just half a day , you have a remote . Yeah . There you go . Right from the start of the day . Yeah I think <disfmarker> We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . <gap> we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ? Which was the whiteboard and the pens . Yeah . We've used the whiteboard . Super super . I had some problem with the pen I think , Minus your PowerPoint fiasco . but <vocalsound> minus your p <vocalsound> Well that's not my fault . That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , No I know . I'm <disfmarker> yeah . Well <disfmarker> Incom <vocalsound> uh they've just you know <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Heads are gonna roll , believe me . Have a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we have a list of employees that you would like fired . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes yes . Okay . N new ideas found ? Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Kinda . Yes for the remote . Maybe no not f for Technology used . technology . Alright . Closing . Costs are within the budget . Project is evaluated . Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . That's it . Excellent . And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Actually . Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . We might have a while though . And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . <gap> . But that's the end of our meeting .
So uh good morning . Morning . Morning . Morning . I see you all find your places . Is everybody sitting on the right place ? Yeah ? Yep . I guess so . So <disfmarker> Let's see . First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh <disfmarker> if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , My name's Frank . hello . Hello . I'm <gap> . Bart . Hello . Hello . <gap> Bart . Welcome . Thank you . Uh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation . Uh Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . You can see there are a few cameras here . They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off . Is being modified by the administrator . <vocalsound> Hmm , that's interesting . Uh okay <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Let's do it read only . Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart <gap> the project manager so I'll direct you through the project . This is our agenda . <vocalsound> Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . <vocalsound> Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or <disfmarker> Let's see . Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . Sure . I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yep . Visit it . Yep . Yeah . Have you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one . <vocalsound> No ? Hmm ? Can't say I paid much attention to it , I can see if it works this way . <vocalsound> No , it doesn't work here . <vocalsound> Okay no problem . But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh <disfmarker> there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . Oh yeah . Real Remote is not really the company we're <disfmarker> we are , but it's just a little <gap> fault . Okay . Yeah . Um okay , what are we going to do ? <vocalsound> Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . <vocalsound> We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . Okay . And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original . <vocalsound> And we've got our User Interface Designer . Yep . He's also uh <disfmarker> That's about the new remote control . Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . <vocalsound> I had some role indications on here . But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . <vocalsound> And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project <disfmarker> uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . <vocalsound> Then we've got our first tool training . <vocalsound> We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny 'Kay . because you can draw with it on this page um in the <disfmarker> think it is form of . You can also select the current colour and the line width . Hmm . But then first you have to select the pen function . But we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . <vocalsound> Uh then a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , project <gap> project <disfmarker> what was it ? Project documents <gap> I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . Okay . Yeah . Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings . And then we're going to try out the white board . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So as you can see we g all <vocalsound> going to draw a animal . <vocalsound> Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mouse wasn't running away . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That was interesting . Is everybody <disfmarker> is anybody playing with the mouse ? <vocalsound> Innocent . No . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We're going to uh draw animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh there's <disfmarker> I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . Okay . 'Kay . Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . Then the line width . I think seven will be nice . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . <vocalsound> These are not very much , but uh <disfmarker> Uh , see you have to do it real slow . <vocalsound> Oh <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sure . Ah <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I was trying to draw a dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it's close . I'm thinking about a swordfish . So what <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . yeah it's <disfmarker> this is bit of the swordfish . <vocalsound> Yeah , he hasn't got an eye . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <gap> <vocalsound> Woah . <vocalsound> Now we've got another function . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . We've got the eraser . <vocalsound> And then you can undo this easily . Meat . Ah it's okay . <vocalsound> And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . Uh is <disfmarker> They've got no text tool , no . Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . This is typically a undo action , I think . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Pen . Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . But I don't know , I'm just trying . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is not my work , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> okay . Hmm . Maybe you have to use <disfmarker> Oh . <vocalsound> Uh . I think it's a <disfmarker> it wants to draw a <disfmarker> another animal ? I don't know . It lives for the fun . So <disfmarker> It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . Okay . <vocalsound> So Okay . now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . <vocalsound> Go ahead . Thank you . Okay . Gonna use a different line width . And I'm gonna draw in black . There . 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go . Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Hmm . Because this is going a lot better than uh I did . <vocalsound> A sheep . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is my um <disfmarker> Hmm . Sheep . It's nice . <vocalsound> With of course <vocalsound> little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a real dead sheep , There . yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> For recognition , yeah , I see . <vocalsound> Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . 'Kay . On just a <disfmarker> They are <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Come on . You have to go really slow when you're writing . Yeah . They're brilliant animal animals . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And that's just a little me thingy . So . Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer . Okay . Nice . Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head , but mm <disfmarker> Let's see . Mm . Uh . <gap> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sweet . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Interesting . <vocalsound> Yeah . You know what that is ? Or who ? A rabbit ? Garfield . Ah okay , yeah . Garfield . Yeah . Just a <disfmarker> Mm . Guess . So uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . That's enough . <vocalsound> Um , you say a blank , or <disfmarker> Yeah , just a blank sheet . Okay . Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'll just try something else . No . <vocalsound> Something different than Garfield . <vocalsound> Mine is a bit more skinny . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's pretty skinny cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But uh <disfmarker> And the most interesting tail . Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , it's supposed to be a cat . I like cats because uh they are uh independent . Ah . The pen . <vocalsound> So . Okay . That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So Yeah . if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask The pen . <vocalsound> and go ahead . It's pretty uh easy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . S <gap> We're being haunted . haunted white board . <vocalsound> So we've got the tool uh introduction . We move along to the project finance . <vocalsound> Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium . Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . It won't work . So just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros . So that's leads us to our little discussion . We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . So I'm gonna sit down , I think . It's easier . Yeah , you got a message . I've got a message . Five minutes . Five minutes , okay . Okay , that's uh good timing . <vocalsound> <gap> So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? Mm ? Uh maybe you have to say the magic word . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Right . <vocalsound> Does it do anything ? No . Maybe you have to just clap it down ? Mm back up again . No slide show . Hmm . It's off now . It's off . Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah . You'll be okay , I think . Well , it was on , but <disfmarker> Well it's those laptops . <vocalsound> Ah , there we are . Nice . Okay . <vocalsound> But so mm <vocalsound> does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? Mm . Oh really ? No ? Huh . You ? Well , <vocalsound> we have a No , me neither . It's a <disfmarker> kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . Ah yeah . And I think it's <disfmarker> it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . Yep . Yeah Sure . Yeah . I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . Okay , yeah . Yeah . And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . Okay , yeah . Oh really . So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um Hmm . Oh . Yeah . Mm-hmm . thing . <vocalsound> Um but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh . That's good to remember . So I think you can take minutes again . Yeah , that's nice , I think . <vocalsound> Since it's your job . So we've <disfmarker> we want different functions Yeah . uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think . Mm . Yeah . But that would be really good if we could do that . <vocalsound> And other functions for a remote control ? Maybe we can make it uh uh Um . Mm-hmm . Think it has to be shock proof Sure , yeah . 'cause Shock proof . my remote control tends to fall a lot . Waterproof , or uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sure . So <disfmarker> Uh , you never no know uh , I w I mean uh <disfmarker> Waterproof . Okay . So these are our um a few things we can think of . Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder . 'Kay . Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . So you can see That's a <disfmarker> battery stays . Okay , yeah . how much is left in the battery . But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . Yeah . Mm . Uh . But maybe just a little LED , I don't know . That's an idea as well . Other ideas ? Quick ideas . Nope . They were all mentioned , Mm . so <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Any questions about this uh presentation ? Kick off presentation . Um . Nope , don't think so . No ? <gap> Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . Finish meeting now . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> And we can all work uh on our own projects . <vocalsound> Aye sir . Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think . Half an hour . Okay . Okay . Okay . So good luck . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yep .
<vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's okay . That's okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Am I starting now ? Anytime ? Oh sorry . 'Kay , um . Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . <vocalsound> Um , and um , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and um <disfmarker> Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . Um , so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . And , um <disfmarker> So , sorry ? So , um , take it away Poppy . Okay . Um , do I need to <disfmarker> <gap> It's , it's plugged in . So , um <disfmarker> plugged in . F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight . F_ okay . Function F_ eight . Sorry about this guys . No problem . <gap> 'Kay . <gap> is on . Right . <gap> Okay . I will take this time just to apologise . <vocalsound> I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , <vocalsound> which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . <vocalsound> But there we go . I'm sure it's fine . Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . Um , from <disfmarker> Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there . Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . Right , um , one question . Yeah . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? Um <disfmarker> So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? And then <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , Yeah . and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . Mm-hmm . Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ? You could <disfmarker> we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least . Alright . Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , Okay . but <disfmarker> This sounds like a really great idea . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Yeah . Yeah . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , Yeah . um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . Well I <disfmarker> the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . Because of this , their properties are smart material . All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . Mm-hmm . Alright . So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , We'll still have to investigate the financial implications . but <disfmarker> Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . Yeah . Okay . Um also there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet . I'm sorry , There we go could you <disfmarker> . Sorry , should I go back . Those were um <disfmarker> This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . Okay . So I just <gap> put all those components in . So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the <disfmarker> Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . Alright . Great . Okay ? So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ? There we go . Okay . Alright . Thank you very much . Thank you . And , um , the next presenter will be Tara . <vocalsound> There you go Tara . Thanks . Can you see ? Oh , <vocalsound> Do you think <disfmarker> Is it uh , function eight yeah ? <vocalsound> Function F_ eight . Yeah . Function F_ eight . Function F_ eight . Sorry . The one at the top . Oh right . Okay . That looks right . Yeah . Okay . I'm the User <vocalsound> um User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . <vocalsound> I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and <disfmarker> Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself . Ch Oh , I see . Yeah . Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . 'Kay . Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included . So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . <gap> Right . And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? yeah , Okay . Right . other entertainment devices . Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? Um , <vocalsound> I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> And limit the design <gap> . Do you think ? Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . Yeah . Mm-hmm . We'll have more money to go into the design side of it . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Alright . Sounds great . Mm , 'kay . Alright , well , um , <vocalsound> are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ? Yes I am . Fabulous . Except you're not hooked up to the <disfmarker> Oh , I'm not hooked up , <vocalsound> but other than that , completely ready . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Great . Okay . Okay . Oh . I just lost my microphone . <gap> No problem , Just a moment . we can <disfmarker> Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings . Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household . I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . Mm-hmm . Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , Mm . you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , Yeah . um , to influence our remote control . Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number . <vocalsound> Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . Okay . Mm . Yeah . Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . They're you know thumb-masters . Mm-hmm . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting . Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . Mm . <gap> the single function . And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , Yeah . because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . Yes . Yeah . Yeah that's a good point . Yeah . And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . That's a huge amount . <vocalsound> This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages . Is that <disfmarker> It's um <disfmarker> It's like the news . Or like information . It has <disfmarker> T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . Yeah . The <disfmarker> and what's on . So like a running banner , underneath <disfmarker> It's um <disfmarker> No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . No , li Yeah . Yeah . I haven't used it before Oh . but <disfmarker> It's like <disfmarker> And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . Okay . It's like very basic internet . Sort of , Very basic internet , yeah . um <disfmarker> Okay . But you have <disfmarker> Like tells you the weather , and <disfmarker> Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know . Okay . Like the internet you can send emails and <disfmarker> You've no interaction . Yeah , Right . it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and <disfmarker> Yeah . Alright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't <disfmarker> But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . Yeah . Yeah . Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings . Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? P Sorry . Changing the channels ? Tuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , Oh , okay . do you th do you think ? To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Mm . Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay . Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . <gap> So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . <vocalsound> <gap> Repetitive strain injury . Repeti Uh . Ah . I think . Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ? <vocalsound> That's rather sad . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , maybe our Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . Yeah , yeah . I think it is . I'm not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . Mm . Yeah . But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem . Yeah . It is . Okay . Did you guys uh get that one down ? Mm-hmm . Yep . Um <vocalsound> okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here . Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . I agree with um <disfmarker> if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Mm-hmm . Um , financially and and functionally . Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . Mm . Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . So that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . Um and depending on how many members you have in households . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . Yeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . <vocalsound> Right . Wonder if it would have <disfmarker> Yeah . And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , Mm-hmm . Yeah . although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but <vocalsound> <gap> could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . <vocalsound> <gap> Yeah . If we're looking for a simplistic design , if <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . Mm . Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated <disfmarker> It looks like <disfmarker> Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure . Mm-hmm . It'd be like the ultimate remote . <gap> Um <vocalsound> okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . Yeah . So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with . Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is . Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . S Or like um <disfmarker> Mobile phone . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Or <disfmarker> Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock . What , what would appear on the screen ? I have no idea still . <vocalsound> I'm sorry . <vocalsound> Oh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on <disfmarker> Oh , on the remote . Yeah . Okay . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting . Yeah . Could it it <disfmarker> It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be <disfmarker> Like linked in with the teletext , Mm-hmm . Yeah . That would be good , yeah . or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . Yeah . Might be quite expensive to do that though . Mm , Yeah . Could be . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . Right . Mm-hmm . Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . Yeah . Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . <vocalsound> So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . Mm-hmm . And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Mm-hmm . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , yeah . Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . Yeah . And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , Twenties . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . Yeah . Yep . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . Yeah . Yeah . Alright . Okay . Okay . That's it for the market research . Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on <gap> we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because <disfmarker> Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . Can I just interrupt ? Yep . Would you like to plug in your <disfmarker> Yeah . Maybe we can do the <disfmarker> Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? Okay , sure . Yeah I do . I'm looking at <disfmarker> looking at it right now . Okay . Thanks . There you go . <gap> thank you . Oh , come back screen . <vocalsound> Hmm . <gap> Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , <gap> Yeah . Yeah . but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . Okay . Yeah . Okay . Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um <disfmarker> We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . Right . Yeah . Yeah . So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . Okay . Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company Just <disfmarker> but , another thing is that , um <vocalsound> we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . Okay . Work on that . It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay . Yeah , I think . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Real Reaction ? Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . Okay . It'll <disfmarker> It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve . <gap> Okay , so I <disfmarker> Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? Yeah . Is that how most people feel about that ? Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . I think it would be annoying though if <disfmarker> I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if <disfmarker> Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . You'd <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . So is it just <disfmarker> Never heard of it . Yeah . Okay . Alright . Yeah Right . . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . Do you know if anywhere else has it ? I don't know . I don't know . I don't know . More research required , I think . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> But if <disfmarker> Was it a management decision that we're having <disfmarker> It was a management decision , Okay . Yeah . So <disfmarker> so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . Okay . Okay then . 'Kay . So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple . Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . 'Kay . Um . Minimal <disfmarker> And the <disfmarker> What was the word they used ? F findability is important . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah okay . Yeah . 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared Yeah . The same signalling . the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . I mean <disfmarker> It's not that expensive to do . Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . Like you just a , a buzz or something . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . I like that idea . Yeah . Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? <vocalsound> 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , so If <vocalsound> <disfmarker> you'd ha Do you mean the the link between the <disfmarker> Yeah , with the button that you pressed . Well , if the button was actually on <disfmarker> Yeah . The button <disfmarker> Oh . Yeah . Oh , yeah . <vocalsound> C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , <vocalsound> Minor detail there . so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . Maybe <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . Yeah , it would have t Yeah . Mm-hmm . Obviously something small that's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , that's a good point . Yeah . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use <disfmarker> It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Yeah , okay . Would it need a battery then ? Maybe , um <disfmarker> Pr probably . Probably , I mean . Unless it could be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's your department you'll have to sort that out . <vocalsound> Mm . Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ . Yeah . So , mm , more research into that one . Yeah , you'll have to <disfmarker> Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah . alright ? Great . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ? Y On the buttons ? I I like the light up suggestion . I think that would be better . Yeah . 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <gap> it doesn't <disfmarker> Yeah . I would go for <disfmarker> It could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . And there's something on it . S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . Like a raised <disfmarker> Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised . The numbers themselves . Yeah . Could be raised . But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? Yeah . Yeah <disfmarker> Hmm . I just thought that <gap> it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . But I mean <disfmarker> Yeah . Um , so like big b um buttons , <gap> for people you are visually impaired . Yeah . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . Mm-hmm . So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . That , I think that's good , yeah . Yeah . Could we somehow <disfmarker> We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> No , I wouldn't say so . No , it's not these days . I mean , it's quite easily accessible . Yeah . I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , Yeah . That's good <disfmarker> Yeah that a good idea . Yeah . so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . Yeah . Yeah . And you don't want to turn on the lights , <vocalsound> to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . It lights up for <disfmarker> That , yeah , that's a good idea . Yeah . Yeah . On self timer . So self-timed lighting . Yeah . Alright we have five minutes left Um , I <disfmarker> um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was <disfmarker> I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . Yeah . Yeah . Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed . Yeah , Yeah . and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . So , self-timed <disfmarker> So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . Yeah . Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , so <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Yeah . That's probably feasible . So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . Mm-hmm . I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah . Yeah , okay . And I think that's un unique as well . I mean , I haven't seen that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . Yeah , yeah . And it could <gap> , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no <gap> durable . what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Oh right , Yeah . the <disfmarker> Repetitive strain injury . Yeah instead of like hard buttons . Okay . Mm-hmm . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? If <disfmarker> Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . Mm-hmm . I was gonna say , <gap> And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . Exactly . Yeah . It the <disfmarker> it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . Yeah . Yeah , Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . and we could <disfmarker> Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , So <disfmarker> which could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Right . or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so <disfmarker> Right . Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things . I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . Yeah . Mm . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . Yeah . Yeah . Or , or the , whate <gap> Yeah . Yeah . But with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . That's true . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Is <disfmarker> Are you okay with that ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Cool . Um <disfmarker> Alright . So I think that um Is <disfmarker> that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . And now it's up to designing . And um making sure that this can be feasible . What um <disfmarker> And do you have anything <disfmarker> Oh sorry . Do you have anything to say ? <vocalsound> Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um Okay . Oh yeah . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . Interchangeable thing ? Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> Like an iPod or something ? That would be good . Exactly , like an iPod . Yeah , or <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Exactly . Okay . Or , or like mobile ph . Like a cellphone ? Yeah . And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Y Could buy extra <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Accessories . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . Person <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Well , that's great . That's a good idea . Yeah . Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that . Interchangeable . Um , als 'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . You'd just get one mould , No . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Interchan throw some plastic in it , you know . <vocalsound> And also possible <disfmarker> I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or <disfmarker> Oh yeah . Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . Right . Yeah . So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . But if we , there is <disfmarker> If w Yeah . We could <disfmarker> Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again . Right . Right . We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Yeah . Um , does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? Um , I've <disfmarker> Because we need to investigate the financial implications . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Let's <disfmarker> Is it <disfmarker> Does it need to be uh decided on now ? Or should we <disfmarker> I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then . Okay . Good . Alright then . Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ? No . No . Alright , well . Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Alright ? Thank you .
Okay . <vocalsound> Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops . <vocalsound> Hmm . Ah , pinball . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Not doing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . Ah . Hey . <vocalsound> Ah . Uh <disfmarker> Oh . Now I have my screen back too . <vocalsound> Very good . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> we have presentations . So first , it's your turn . <gap> Mine . Oh , great . <vocalsound> Yeah . Isn't it amazing . <vocalsound> Huh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Very interesting . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Industrial Designer . Interface concept . <vocalsound> Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . <vocalsound> Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . <vocalsound> Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's <disfmarker> that they're all pretty uh uh high uh <disfmarker> Large . Yeah . Yeah . A lot <disfmarker> a lot of buttons buttons . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh <disfmarker> Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . <vocalsound> So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . So , that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? Uh , well <disfmarker> We don't have buttons for the menu . Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel <gap> . Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea . Okay . So , uh how <disfmarker> But <gap> uh <disfmarker> You have to put it on the <disfmarker> Like this . Yeah . Or or this . And that the menu button is okay . Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Yes . Uh , so the <disfmarker> The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one . Yeah . Uh , well that's something to uh think about . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . <vocalsound> But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think . <vocalsound> Not too much colours . Uh , no . Not too much . But uh <disfmarker> No , it's not flower power . No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh <disfmarker> and <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> S okay . Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . Okay . That was that . Thank you . So , you're next . I'm next , okay . <vocalsound> Yes . No . Here we go . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , <gap> Okay . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you <disfmarker> it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice <gap> have it curved . And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh <gap> it won't have to burst uh like in the <disfmarker> in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons Hmm . uh if you <gap> push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the <disfmarker> for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . You have any more questions about this ? I think the main thing is we look at the costs . Yep . Hmm . And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has . Yeah . But , thi i uh <disfmarker> This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , Not with an L_C_D_ . not . No , isn't . No . But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . But then it's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . Th then you'll see it on the television . If you don't <disfmarker> Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . When you scroll . Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . So you may not be uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No . The television must do that . Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . And mostly they are smaller . Yes . So <disfmarker> But that won't be a problem . I think . Most the times that are not advanced televisions . No , <vocalsound> but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . Okay . Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? <vocalsound> I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher . <vocalsound> 'Cause it <disfmarker> I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . That's important . That's true . And that might uh bring back the costs uh <disfmarker> But then we'll <disfmarker> I think we must discuss who <disfmarker> uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . I can uh look on my uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's very important . <gap> Uh <disfmarker> Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . Yeah , more expensive . But how much ? <vocalsound> Doesn't say . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Huh . Hmm . Okay . That's from my manufacturing division . Okay . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , thank you . My turn ? Yes ? Next . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . So <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . <vocalsound> 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend <disfmarker> uh trends . And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel <disfmarker> have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . <vocalsound> And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture . <vocalsound> To get a feeling for this . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's <disfmarker> it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be <disfmarker> uh can be totally different . And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind . Changing covers . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Any questions ? Nope . No . No . It's clear . So now , it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ah , let's see . Now , w we have to decide <vocalsound> Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at <disfmarker> 'S next . Components and user interface concept . So <disfmarker> Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . First , uh user interface . Uh , uh-uh . How w how we how we make it ? Uh <disfmarker> Yes , a concept on uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all <disfmarker> Just <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ? Yeah , but if I paint with <disfmarker> I'll paint . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Mm . Something like this ? Or <disfmarker> Mm , yes . Shapes or <disfmarker> What do we need ? Can make several uh concepts . What ? Yes , okay . We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . Okay . More like something <disfmarker> Yeah I I I uh <disfmarker> yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> M like <disfmarker> Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And you have to . <vocalsound> I have to . Yeah . I'm not a designer . It's more <gap> three D_ . Like , um when you have a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's like a gun . <vocalsound> A g <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , it has to be soft ? Mm . <gap> . And it has to be soft , yeah . Okay . So , you can squeeze in it and <disfmarker> And uh , the buttons ? Sorry ? Buttons . Buttons on top of it . And here . The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . <vocalsound> No , it won't . <vocalsound> But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ? But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine . But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels . Yeah , okay . But but how <disfmarker> Yeah . And the b <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah ? How <disfmarker> Or two buttons . Okay . And i if we go to uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , two scroll uh wheels . If uh <disfmarker> 'Kay c If we do <disfmarker> If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back <vocalsound> Mm . That's th that's more difficult . But if we have uh a me Yeah . It's better in <disfmarker> If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Yeah . Because uh , from h hundred uh <gap> remote controls , ninety nine have it . But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . Yeah . Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . Uh-uh . Yeah , but <vocalsound> again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You don't know . So , there's no menu . I don't know . It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext . <vocalsound> No . So you can't use it . And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . 'Kay . But you all like this kind of thing . Uh <disfmarker> Good concept . But <disfmarker> With the scroll button . That's one . And and this one has to be soft . Uh-uh . And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it . Mm-hmm . It's one . Two . Number two . And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Like uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Ah that's nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Here . Trigger . <vocalsound> No . Just to uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But when you handle it , you put it on and off . It's not good to use . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but <vocalsound> I'll zap . Oh , like a <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Fuck . Out . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , it's not good . Yeah . <vocalsound> Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . Then uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Paint it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Paint it ? <vocalsound> With the scroll thing on , like this ? One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah . Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . So ? And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . <vocalsound> Draw it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Unbelievable . Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Not so difficult . <vocalsound> Yeah . But if you put <disfmarker> push the the menu button <disfmarker> Uh , that's the menu . Yeah , wh what <disfmarker> There for the L_C_D_ screen . Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . You have to <disfmarker> For the menu . Yeah . Mm-hmm . One that way . And one that way . So <disfmarker> Then it depends on the cost . S On and off . <vocalsound> But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and <disfmarker> When it's not too big . Just like a a phone . Mm-hmm . M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um Separate , more separate , h yeah . more separate , yeah . Yes , okay . Like , you have the menu button in between uh <disfmarker> Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you have a big uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very good . Is it better ? When you uh <gap> the menu , you have to go there there there there . I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . Yeah . They were like round curves , uh different uh <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . Okay , okay , okay . But now the <disfmarker> First the buttons . Mm-hmm . Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um <disfmarker> The mute button . Sorry ? We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the <disfmarker> to to uh <disfmarker> have to uh <disfmarker> numbers Mute . And the other . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Not so difficult . <vocalsound> But , uh <disfmarker> Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle . But how do you wanna solve it ? With the switch button . Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy . Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . No like uh <disfmarker> Oh , you mean like that . Yeah . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um <disfmarker> A joystick . Yeah , and joystick , I think . Yeah . But is it uh <disfmarker> Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop . Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ? <vocalsound> I don't know . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Why do I pay you for ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , well <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Better ideas . <vocalsound> Okay . Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And <disfmarker> <gap> No , no . It won't work . For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . Yeah . Uh-huh . So <disfmarker> Think we have to keep them . Or a remote control more like joystick . Yeah , but is it <disfmarker> That's not expensive than uh <disfmarker> Joystick is better . A small one . A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k No just like in a Playstation thing . a laptop . Small , round . <vocalsound> Then it's not so big . No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Oh the sh Just like a Playstation thing . Yeah , but then you can <disfmarker> Yeah . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Maybe , if it's possible , <vocalsound> it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one . So , please look at it . <vocalsound> No , that's okay , I got <disfmarker> And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ? Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they're not uh in details . <vocalsound> It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? <vocalsound> Yeah we <disfmarker> I think you get it . So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . <vocalsound> <gap> Then I have to come with it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs . Your problem . Not mine . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then I'll uh make something up . Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Mm , yeah . Then it's <disfmarker> Ch cheapest way , I think . Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . No , no kinetic . Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . more expensive . Yeah . So we use a normal battery . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Yes . Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . Depends on the scroll . Scroll . If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . And that's <disfmarker> Yeah . And uh , we <disfmarker> If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to Uh the most expensive . Yes , okay . Yeah . So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . If we <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . If we <disfmarker> No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and <disfmarker> But , it has to be small . I think . Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? If you have pistol , it <disfmarker> L_C_D_'s not easy . Y y <vocalsound> Yeah but <disfmarker> Just use your thumb . If you use a phone . If you <disfmarker> Yeah . I use my thumb . <gap> k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . Yeah . And the screen is <disfmarker> Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . If you have a joystick on <disfmarker> No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . <vocalsound> Yeah . And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh <vocalsound> straight . No . No , no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's how we use it . Uh <disfmarker> That's why they make joysticks like that , I think . Yeah , but then you look forward . Uh , yeah , but <disfmarker> And then you can y Yeah . Yeah ? N well , if you have to look at it . If you <disfmarker> 'Kay . Here's our designer . If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ . Yeah . Then it goes like this . Yeah , why not . If th n well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's for the younger people . Yes , of course . It's something new . <vocalsound> It's uh <disfmarker> That's good good . But the <disfmarker> um , it may not break . Now we put uh rubber around it . Okay . If that's possible . Um , Yeah . Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber . <gap> Okay . <gap> I can't see the <gap> . Or you can uh turn it inside . But , uh the easy of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But that's <disfmarker> uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it . Huh . No , that's true . Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah of course . This is something new . <vocalsound> Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So , Costs are okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um we have one minute . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> One . I think . No . No . You have more . More . Seven . You have still ten . Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up . Oh , that's us together . You two stay here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Paint it . Okay . Now you have to . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> I think it's clear . Check your mail . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yes . It has to be ready in the next meeting . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> What ? Cookie . Okay . Next meeting is called the detailed design . So <disfmarker> Everyth everything has to be ready . Okay . Thanks for your attention . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . See you at the next meeting . Bye bye .
Okay . Or you get it . Okay . No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length . Okay , and then . <vocalsound> So we uh <disfmarker> we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . Yeah , s yeah , um . <vocalsound> Mm <vocalsound> . Yours is well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think you can put anywhere you want , actually . Yeah I thin but the the mic should not <disfmarker> It's not a directional mic , anyway . <vocalsound> I think it should work like this . Uh . So I will try to get my presentation running . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Can't help you with that . Last . It's no matter . Okay , it's y yeah . No problem . Ah yes . Right . Okay . Then press uh al Okay . This . I don't know . You know ? Just try . 'Kay . On this normal <disfmarker> Oh oh . Alt F_ five . Good . Doesn't appear on the screen here . <vocalsound> Right well <disfmarker> Oh . Wow . Amazing . It's working <vocalsound> . Okay . Thank you . <vocalsound> Uh . Hold that . Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your <disfmarker> Okay . Somewhere . Okay . Mm . So , <vocalsound> good morning , everyone . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Welcome at uh <disfmarker> at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . I hope you all have been uh updated about it . Yeah . Good . So . Yes . So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . <vocalsound> Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . See what our roles are in this project . So , um <disfmarker> We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh <disfmarker> to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope <vocalsound> how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . Mm-hmm . Total . Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh <disfmarker> wh what uh what our new product should look lite <disfmarker> like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting . So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um <disfmarker> We <disfmarker> When you design a new product you of <disfmarker> uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh <disfmarker> we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . <vocalsound> So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um <disfmarker> You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training . In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a a <disfmarker> a <disfmarker> a white-board . Whitebo Mm-hmm . And um well it should work uh <disfmarker> I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Under documents in the shared folder . Okay . Yes . Do <disfmarker> Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah . Yes well we will then find out ho how it works . Yes . Um . Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . So , we'll come to that later . So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here . So , I would suggest uh <disfmarker> Each of us is going . Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'm not really sure how this works , but <disfmarker> Okay , shall I start ? Mm . Yeah . Yeah , you can start it you know . Yes , a good idea Mael . I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . So , i No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there Mm . Mm . which is going to record the strokes that you make . But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . Okay . Yeah . 'Kay . <vocalsound> But it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Actually , I think I cannot go with uh <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> D doesn't it work ? Maybe someo Maybe <disfmarker> maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . I have to draw . So um <disfmarker> L Why don't you draw uh <vocalsound> your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . <vocalsound> M my <disfmarker> my favourite animal . <vocalsound> Sorry this is all tangled up here . Oh , I see uh <disfmarker> That's better . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yes . Mm . So draw it . We will try to guess what it is . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I'm a very bad drawer . <vocalsound> Weird . Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . I'm a bad drawer . Okay . Mm . They're ears , by the way . 's a cat . No . Um close though . Okay so <disfmarker> like a pet animal . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Like a cat . Yeah . It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat . <vocalsound> No , not a cat though . What is this now ? Ah you forget about it . You're on the knife . Yeah , uh I think it's fine . I just don't want to carry it off . Man , this wires , eh ? We need a wireless microphone . <vocalsound> You know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that . So , Okay . So . that's the cat . It's not a cat , Oh . it's a dog . So . Mael . It's a dog . Yes . So but that's also kind of cat , Oh the dog doesn't have a tail ? isn't it ? <vocalsound> It's got a tail then . B bo both predators . Yeah , sure , yeah . Yeah yeah . I thought so . The dogs have a tail . So , thank you . So do cats . <vocalsound> Uh d did you uh work out cord ? <vocalsound> And you guessed cats without a tail . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , I think I will go without <disfmarker> without it , Okay . right ? Okay . It'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that . Okay , there you go . So what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . A horse ? It's a horse . <vocalsound> This is why you're the designer . And I'm marketing . <vocalsound> Yes . Yes , yes this is <disfmarker> Yes definitely a horse . Yes . Oh very good . So <disfmarker> Ah <vocalsound> I suppose it <disfmarker> Ah I think you can put that . Mm-hmm . That's it . <vocalsound> A blue and black zebra <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> Can <disfmarker> you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So <disfmarker> The very rare blue zebras . Yes . <gap> I'll tell to get it off my <disfmarker> Ma Matthew ? Uh ? Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> You got a lot of room here . Maybe <disfmarker> You can probably reach . Oh y it's not for that . No ? No . I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael . Okay . Yeah . So what should I draw ? Mm . He has already to do cat . I took a dog . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . A mouse ? This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ? Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yes , the moustache . So <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> that's definitely a cat . Mm-hmm . Uh yeah . And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this . <vocalsound> It's quite , you know <disfmarker> relaxed situation . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yes , okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> She has the small legs . Th thank you , Matthew . Yeah . <vocalsound> Thank you , Matthew . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Perfect . <vocalsound> Oh a rat , okay . Yes , this is certain uh <disfmarker> some contribution to our project . <vocalsound> And you , <gap> Mm 'kay . Your turn . So . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet . So you've all drawn land animals , so why not draw an animal from the water . <vocalsound> A bird . Okay , in the water . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah I don't know what that is . It's a bit <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> It's a bit hard to guess . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Put it colours . Maybe it would help us . Yeah . Yes . The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? With different pen widths . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm So <disfmarker> Oh , it's a shark now . Ah it's a shark , yeah . <vocalsound> Oh , yes , why not ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Good idea . Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me , you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? Mm . Oh . Now it's a swordfish . <vocalsound> Why not . A swordfish . You have some in <disfmarker> in Australia , <vocalsound> right ? <vocalsound> Swordfish . Yeah . Um , maybe . I dunno . I've never seen one , no . Oh well . Yeah . I hope it still works . Perfect . So <disfmarker> So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually <vocalsound> But uh <disfmarker> You should go for the next one it seems to me . W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . Yeah , exactly , yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Let's continue to uh <disfmarker> to the real stuff . Wow . Um our project uh finance uh thing . Uh when we are <disfmarker> and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh <disfmarker> People uh Twenty four . Yeah . want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um Per remote control , product . yeah ? Mm . Per project . Yes . Okay . Um <vocalsound> more interesting for our company <vocalsound> of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh <vocalsound> um things . Uh we will try to uh to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America , Ah yeah , the sale man , four million . maybe some uh Asian countries . Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . <vocalsound> So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics . Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ? Of course . They have to sell at least four million to make a profit <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> You all have to be paid . Mm . Ah Excuse me ? we have to make <disfmarker> we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill Oh you're g very good in mathematics . Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes , indeed . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Four million . So uh well Yeah . I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think . So , that about finance . And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . Mm-hmm . Of course it should have a on off button . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . Mm . Yeah . Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . Mm . You might need uh <disfmarker> We wer we were thinking television . Uh . Mm . We are targ targeting the television set . So , Mm . you need to record the channels . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> You need to browse the <disfmarker> browse the channels in upward downward way , Yes , yes . Mm . Th th that's very handy I <disfmarker> I always miss it and <disfmarker> on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . Uh <disfmarker> And <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Uh , and <disfmarker> And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we are the marketing guy ? Or <disfmarker> I'm marketing . th Marketing . So you are the marketing . Yep . And you are in the u use user interface uh design . Yeah . Yes . So just <disfmarker> yeah Yeah . I wanted to to be sure . Sure . And I I'm the the industrial designer Mm-hmm . okay . <vocalsound> Yes . Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . Oh . I'm Matthew . You know . <vocalsound> Okay . Mael . Matth s uh Happy to meet you . Anna . <vocalsound> Okay . Anna . It's very uh <disfmarker> And A and I'm Nanne . um uh Matthew , yeah . I thi think you know me , So <disfmarker> Uh so yeah uh <disfmarker> Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh <disfmarker> not face to face . yeah ? right yeah . Yes . So . Um <disfmarker> S <vocalsound> So mm <disfmarker> So . S s Mm . <vocalsound> So Are there some other very important things to to do <disfmarker> well , So <disfmarker> I to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned . Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah . And uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then <disfmarker> you uh <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so <disfmarker> Yes . Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ? Yeah Mm . I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . Yeah . Mm . But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . Yeah . Ah it's <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . Mm , well uh I I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Actually , yeah Uh w y you two should <disfmarker> should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . Let's <disfmarker> Let's take <disfmarker> w <vocalsound> Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . Mm . Yeah . Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . But <disfmarker> Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a <disfmarker> it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , I think . So Mm . twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . Mm . Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , <vocalsound> you <disfmarker> you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah , So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to <disfmarker> but w w we want to design a new one . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things Yeah . and then um <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah . Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . Yeah . Yeah . Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . Okay . So <disfmarker> Okay , we are alread mm . Mm . Okay . So you know now the basic <disfmarker> the basic things . Yeah . Mm-hmm . well just <disfmarker> just for the next meeting , um L well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean <disfmarker> so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> Um you will be working on <disfmarker> on technical function design , so <disfmarker> Yeah , sure . And uh you <disfmarker> and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? Mm-hmm . Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at Stam . basic basic television uh interface . Yeah . So , uh I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . So Perfect . next meeting will be in uh <disfmarker> in thirty minutes uh . K keep it in mind .
Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . <vocalsound> 'Scuse me . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bless you . Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , <vocalsound> under marketing we targeted our audience , and <disfmarker> Um , yeah . <vocalsound> That was <vocalsound> generally <vocalsound> <disfmarker> how helpful that was . <vocalsound> Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're <disfmarker> Right , um <disfmarker> So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what <disfmarker> where you've come from our last time . Does everyone have presentations ? Hmm . Yeah . Yes . Okay . Yes . Would anybody like to go first ? Sure . Okay . So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . And why not wood ? And , hmm ? And why not wood ? <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , well we can use wood . <vocalsound> I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . So that's what I've got on design . 'S good . Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . which is quite shocking . <vocalsound> Ha . Mm . Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the <vocalsound> is the current trend <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um . For fashion , we go for fashion . Mm . The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to <disfmarker> I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , <vocalsound> but that's just a personal opinion . <vocalsound> I think <vocalsound> I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find <disfmarker> come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . Mm-hmm . Thank you for your attention . So . I think it's the next <disfmarker> it's the blue one , yeah . Oh , uh , there we go . <vocalsound> Uh . Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I actually wasn't aware of the <vocalsound> new trends in electronics <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and and uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um <vocalsound> fabrics . <vocalsound> Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh <disfmarker> Okay , alright anyway . Um <vocalsound> here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying <disfmarker> we're gonna try to talk about , um <vocalsound> what kind of uh <disfmarker> how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . <vocalsound> And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . <vocalsound> Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of <disfmarker> I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this <disfmarker> it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um <vocalsound> the wheel You need a screen for it ? you <disfmarker> it seems like you would need a screen . You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . But like if you think about it <disfmarker> With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So <disfmarker> yeah but if <disfmarker> so is it just <disfmarker> okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , Are we <disfmarker> that was one of th I I was <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> sorry , <vocalsound> I I meant to update you on that . Um . <vocalsound> Alright . Okay . But the screen can come up on the telly , the <disfmarker> she said . Okay . Okay . That correct ? Yeah . So anyway if <disfmarker> well we just <disfmarker> we need to <disfmarker> Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> I was thinking <disfmarker> okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna <disfmarker> I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a <disfmarker> Graphical interface ? right . Yeah Uh on the <disfmarker> like you're g you can have it on the telly though . yeah Yeah . like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can <disfmarker> okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . Yeah . So that <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> people seems to be <disfmarker> well <disfmarker> You've <disfmarker> Yeah , I know what you're saying , You know . you have to <disfmarker> But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um <vocalsound> I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because <disfmarker> So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if <disfmarker> or or <disfmarker> then again if you just <disfmarker> I guess <disfmarker> I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , yeah . But but imagine someone with s My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ . I oh yeah ? But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . <vocalsound> Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to <disfmarker> 'Cause you'll have to like <disfmarker> Yeah . They have to r wheel really fast . but you can quickly s you can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . at least on theirs . Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um <disfmarker> So you're either <disfmarker> you're <disfmarker> you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different Yeah . uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . Like if you just wanted to go to like <disfmarker> from five to six you could tap or someth Right . And then there's also the concern about you know um <vocalsound> how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um <vocalsound> you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , Yeah like <disfmarker> I mean with that many options , you'd <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> I'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , sort of <disfmarker> I would think so too , like <disfmarker> So I mean <disfmarker> and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because <disfmarker> Yeah . but then again it would <disfmarker> it does make kind of <disfmarker> if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of <disfmarker> Yeah . It's more expensive according to the design people . m yeah . Uh . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's the only thing though . You have to get a <disfmarker> an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> You can get to <disfmarker> you know , you can <disfmarker> Like maybe it'll be that central button Yeah , yeah , yeah . that , like , then you hit that and then you can <disfmarker> it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ Mm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the <disfmarker> Yeah . So the T_V_ is the screen , that <disfmarker> yeah , yeah . yeah So it would have all these different options of changing Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . to <disfmarker> Look it even has settings . Okay . Hmm ? On the <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> you can just take theirs and just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , Yeah . but um <disfmarker> 'cause that just <disfmarker> it does seem like , it <disfmarker> that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but <disfmarker> I dunno , and then <disfmarker> so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Um , right . What if <disfmarker> I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , Yeah . <vocalsound> um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or <disfmarker> It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ . Yeah . So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah definitely . Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . okay . Yeah but should be comfortable . I mean it it needs to be easy to <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your <disfmarker> Yeah . I mean how do how do <disfmarker> I'm not really <disfmarker> Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So <disfmarker> Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah I use it like that . W when we had the wheely remote control , we <disfmarker> it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , so <disfmarker> But , were there buttons on there as well ? Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . Mm . Yeah . Mm yeah . So we just used the top part . Yeah . Yeah , Uh . so <disfmarker> but I mean I think it could be pretty small . Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that you can <disfmarker> What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you <disfmarker> so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . But can't you just get <disfmarker> Do <disfmarker> do you know what I'm talking about though ? Yeah . Like , uh , yeah just something <disfmarker> Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of <disfmarker> K Well you can have it on the settings , Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah . no ? Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know <disfmarker> if <disfmarker> so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing Yeah . That keeps it is is <disfmarker> if w I <disfmarker> really <disfmarker> if we can do this , that'd probably be <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh you wouldn't <disfmarker> I don't <disfmarker> I just don't think you would even need it . Yeah , yeah . So <disfmarker> So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this <disfmarker> how they actually programme these things , and if that's <disfmarker> Mean <disfmarker> Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? yeah . I mean you can do it , I don't know . I mean it <disfmarker> would y would <disfmarker> that would be <disfmarker> They already do it . you <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote . it doesn't seem that hard . I mean I've never bought a remote . I'm not sure . It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> which is a little <disfmarker> Well they usually are . Well <disfmarker> My <disfmarker> I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . No . Huh . But um <disfmarker> I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . <vocalsound> So , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> but I mean it's <disfmarker> I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard . Yeah , it <disfmarker> most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . Yeah . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . Yeah . Well so <disfmarker> So , do we need <disfmarker> I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about <disfmarker> But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . That's what it does anyway . <vocalsound> But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you <disfmarker> like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , you don't know they mean , yeah , and I never get it . <vocalsound> it's like <disfmarker> Yeah . Never ever . yeah . So <disfmarker> So , but <disfmarker> oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? Well on the telly . Or on the T_V_ too . On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea <vocalsound> because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those <disfmarker> like okay now I hit this <disfmarker> you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . Mm . Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way , so that fits with the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are <vocalsound> really hot right now , so <disfmarker> B Yeah . Did you did you get that pc picture on <disfmarker> did they provide you with that picture on the web ? Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so <disfmarker> That's quite interesting . What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? <vocalsound> Oh god . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , I was gonna say . Oh . You said uh people want spongy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , one of your <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's <gap> in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy . Oh , okay , that would be cool . Yeah . Ah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Just nice feel , but I hate spongy . <vocalsound> Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of <disfmarker> oh , Yeah . you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . Yeah . But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda <disfmarker> I mean definitely the area round it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so you're like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah I think it could work . Or what if we integrated the <vocalsound> the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables Yeah . <vocalsound> we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like <vocalsound> Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana . Well it could be like mobiles that just <disfmarker> you just put a cover . a vegetable . <vocalsound> An orange . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , <vocalsound> which frankly I'm not particularly fond of , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . You know you had <disfmarker> there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And it could <disfmarker> the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> well I don't know . Um . Yeah . <vocalsound> So what if <disfmarker> what So I think <disfmarker> yeah , colours . <disfmarker> this is <disfmarker> I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . Yeah . Yeah . And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . <vocalsound> Yeah . Is that kind of <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I do I dunno . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just <disfmarker> the feedback we've just got about the <disfmarker> Maybe a ball . A ball ? <vocalsound> Know , a squashy ball . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A relaxing squashy ball . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That you can p That's in the shape of a fruit , like a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> well I <disfmarker> see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit Yeah . and I'm thinking how do you change the hard <disfmarker> would you put a um sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a <disfmarker> This is just <disfmarker> Okay . Oh , okay , yeah . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy . Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That <disfmarker> see I was thinking this s Which is cheaper . sorry <disfmarker> Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually . I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . Oh . Mm . Yeah . And like this <disfmarker> you could have like you could have like cherries and <vocalsound> things around there . Oh I like that shape . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um but <disfmarker> I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> . I was thinking if it was like this <disfmarker> So you're holding a squishy ball 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy <disfmarker> and then it has a <disfmarker> It's like it has to be s Mm-hmm . yeah <vocalsound> . It's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if if you could squish it lower then <disfmarker> Yeah I guess so . Yeah . Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either <disfmarker> like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose . What if , yeah , what if the squishy , Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah . oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can <disfmarker> so so maybe one you know <disfmarker> you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and you could get <disfmarker> you could have your choice , you know ? Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , Yeah . and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm . and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is , Yeah . Okay . and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . No . Okay . Oh . Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater . Yeah . Hmm . Um . Well that's not very neat , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I mean I think uh <disfmarker> and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely <disfmarker> So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your <disfmarker> to the way you hold it . Yeah you could squish it . Mm-hmm . If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you <disfmarker> it it just moulds to your hand . Yeah . Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ? <vocalsound> We we don't know . <vocalsound> Fruits and veg . I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> And the rest is the company <disfmarker> the company colour's silver ? It was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't <disfmarker> We could promote the banana one . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Like <disfmarker> mm . I mean that's another question , where are we gonna <disfmarker> we we should have the logo somewhere on it . Mm . Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't <disfmarker> Oh yeah . Yeah . I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . Yeah , Yeah . th and that would <disfmarker> that <disfmarker> Okay . Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think , um it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . <vocalsound> But uh it <disfmarker> Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . Yeah . No but it does it automatically . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Does it automatically ? Yeah . I don't know . I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> But if someone <disfmarker> components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark . That was me . Was that you ? Yes . Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches . Oh , a dynamo is <disfmarker> ah , <vocalsound> it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I sort of picked battery . It's quite sweet . We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . I think batteries sound good . It <vocalsound> it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . <vocalsound> The dynamo would be interesting <vocalsound> . What does everyone else think ? <vocalsound> No . But dynamo <disfmarker> the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it <vocalsound> creates energy on its own . Oh . What about Kryptonite ? <vocalsound> Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost . Yeah . Don't know the cost . Didn't have enough data to actually <disfmarker> Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost . Okay . Right . Hmm . Mm . Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem . Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . What does chip on print mean ? Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , <vocalsound> Uh-huh . calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . Okay . But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . Right . So , chip on print is just <disfmarker> means like that they're mass-produced . Yeah . Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , Case is what we were discussing yeah . yeah . Casing . Yeah . <gap> thinking of like syntactic case and thi <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> let's see . Is there anything else we need to Hmm . talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . <vocalsound> Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . Oh , thank you . <vocalsound> Mm . Cool . See you soon . Does it matter that I end early ? I <disfmarker> it's strange because <disfmarker> How how early is it ? I didn't get a pop-up thing that said <disfmarker>
So is <disfmarker> Why not save that . No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . <gap> <disfmarker> Do you want to replace existing file , no . <vocalsound> I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but <disfmarker> Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 'Cause that's the save one isn't it , so <disfmarker> And then find it . <gap> spreadsheet . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but I've ta uh <vocalsound> right , I'll just re-do it . That's the easiest way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Well we've made our prototype anyway . We can have a good look at that . <vocalsound> You pass it round to have a look . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm very nice . Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . Mm-hmm . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit <disfmarker> the panel that you pull down . And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . Mm-hmm . And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . Mm-hmm . We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . <vocalsound> So it is , yeah . <vocalsound> Cherry would be alright actually . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? And it's kinda not really at a kind of <disfmarker> you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac . Yeah , yeah , we might get a <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Copyright , yeah . What's this this one ? Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . What's that one there ? Ah , that's the mute . Oh , okay . Right . For the M_ . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> It <disfmarker> it'd probably have to be labelled mute . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write . They're thinking <disfmarker> Okay . For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . Um , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . Mm-hmm . The mute could possibly be a bit smaller . Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . and the the channel is in blue . Mm-hmm . R right . Um , Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus . all these things have cost implications . And so when I done my thing on cost <vocalsound> a <disfmarker> I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . So <disfmarker> However , I've now <gap> . <vocalsound> But um , <vocalsound> yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , I'll see if I can find them . and uh <disfmarker> as I suppose that <vocalsound> so whether <vocalsound> wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose . Yeah , sis Well the colours wouldn't <disfmarker> like that's <disfmarker> they wouldn't be too important , Have <disfmarker> but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . <vocalsound> So that's where the colour buttons came from . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> An important consideration . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right , okay so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And the second one underneath would be the idea for the <disfmarker> Yes , we'll have the slide-away . Right , okay . Bottom . So we've got um detail design meeting . Right . So <disfmarker> So , we've got <vocalsound> prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But other than that , we got the red apple . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , Yes , yes . and <vocalsound> the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . <vocalsound> And the <vocalsound> and the cost implication . Right . Okay . The only snag about this is that uh <vocalsound> the cost is probably kind of important . So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . Mm-hmm . Um , and whether it would uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So if you had to do a presentation or <disfmarker> will you just work it on the prototype ? Uh , that's it . <vocalsound> This this is a <disfmarker> yes , this is our presentation of the prototype . That's the pr Okay . Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost <disfmarker> aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half <disfmarker> uh twelve and a half Euros . Mm-hmm . So , there's no redesign . So that should uh <disfmarker> Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh <disfmarker> Could we get this on the board just so we can see <disfmarker> or do you mean do you have the figures there ? <gap> we should <gap> plug it in . Right . Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one . Okay . 'Kay , Alice . So , sh We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . Right . <gap> . 'Kay this should be then . <vocalsound> Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Have a push button interface . Okay . W the button supplements . Um <disfmarker> Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . Um <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons <disfmarker> Well do we'll do it on the prototype , O so do two , see how much it is . Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . Everything else is gonna be a standard . Yeah . Yeah . And then we'd have <disfmarker> We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , so , I was <disfmarker> <vocalsound> originally , I was thinking <gap> rubber wasn't special , Mm-hmm . but according to this , maybe it is . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . Yeah . I think you just do one , don't you , for the <disfmarker> W <vocalsound> I don't know <vocalsound> is <vocalsound> is <vocalsound> is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore <disfmarker> I mean , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore <disfmarker> I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else <disfmarker> Whereas it would be <disfmarker> the special colour would be for the <disfmarker> So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons <gap> made in a different material , rather than per button . <vocalsound> Mm . I don't know though . I would <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Every design change is uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Hmm . I dunno , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , um , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form . Mm-hmm . And when I plugged that in last time <disfmarker> <gap> remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know , that um <vocalsound> that took care of the uh of the various supplements . Mm-hmm . And if <disfmarker> What happened ? You've just gone off the window into another one . It's on the bottom row . Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . <vocalsound> Yeah . Now , right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special <disfmarker> Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . So that's nine point one there so we've got some <disfmarker> So it <disfmarker> Well , is it s is <disfmarker> no , it's nine point seven I've got . 'Kay . Mm-hmm . Okay . Just give us a bit of <disfmarker> So , that would <vocalsound> that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are <vocalsound> <disfmarker> assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on <gap> . <vocalsound> S I <gap> switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? Uh-huh . Yeah . We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , hold on . Um , if we Okay , that gives us twelve point seven So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the <gap> <disfmarker> without <disfmarker> Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Um , <gap> . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , Yeah , we have to have it <disfmarker> Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . so you need both of them ? Yeah . Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic . Um <disfmarker> And go for battery instead . Yeah . That would give you one less . We should <disfmarker> Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . Yeah , yeah . Well , since it's the <disfmarker> through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . Mm-hmm . Um , whether they would figure the <vocalsound> the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . And then still have the batteries , Mm-hmm . or whatever they would prefer not uh <disfmarker> You know what I mean ? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them . <vocalsound> But which do you think <disfmarker> or which do we think is the more important of the options ? I think the voice recognition . In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . At least . Remember that was a minimum requirement . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it <gap> originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , Yeah . and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? Mm-hmm . Makes sense . Okay . Right um , Okay I have a little thing . So , we've all got a note of <disfmarker> it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . <gap> . Sorry , do you want that back up ? Yeah , I just had a presentation to do . <vocalsound> Right . But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . Okay , but remember the main <disfmarker> the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . Mm-hmm . Mm . <vocalsound> Right okay um , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . <vocalsound> And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . <vocalsound> And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , Okay . so <vocalsound> I'll go over here . <vocalsound> Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Okay , well we have a single curve , which was <gap> maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . Yeah . So uh <disfmarker> Okay . Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Um , <vocalsound> sorry that'd be considered fancy . <vocalsound> Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two . Of <disfmarker> but I think <disfmarker> What <disfmarker> Is one false , or is t one true ? I forgot . One's true . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal And a four is neutral . Four is neutral , okay . So <disfmarker> So maybe <gap> maybe a two . Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . <vocalsound> Go for one . <vocalsound> Yep . Right . <vocalsound> But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can . Okay . Right . Okay . I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . So , false is seven , true is one , and <disfmarker> So uh say about a two for fancy , Yeah . you think ? Yeah . Okay . Yeah , why not not , m m maybe nearer three . Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um <disfmarker> Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something <disfmarker> <vocalsound> remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , Uh-huh . and we're not going for these options . This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . Yeah , so that <disfmarker> so sh should we go for a a two on that ? Okay . 'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? Um , <gap> deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . D yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , Um <disfmarker> we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . But not the kinetic . But not the kinetic . Like the power . No . 'Cause you can't afford that <disfmarker> w we took that out too . No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both . Alright , so <disfmarker> Didn't you ? Or <disfmarker> So it doesn't <disfmarker> It's pretty <disfmarker> The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the <disfmarker> No may is <disfmarker> maybe about neutral Maybe a three . plus it it it's got something , <vocalsound> but it hasn't got <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . I would give it more than a four . The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . Right . Okay . And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . Right , okay . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then <disfmarker> because that <vocalsound> 'Kay . the other functions we've got in are are more at the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors <disfmarker> speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . Mm-hmm . Okay . And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , Um <disfmarker> and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , S I'm just gonna check my email . <vocalsound> which would be <disfmarker> come from the button supplements category . I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product . How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . And then it stand the test of time better . Um , interface type um , well plastic rather than rubber . <vocalsound> Okay . But I <disfmarker> That that that would make the significant difference . You could either <vocalsound> you could have it <disfmarker> If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get <disfmarker> you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And that would enable you to to do it . Okay . So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Ye <vocalsound> <gap> , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . Well , okay , but <disfmarker> Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . It's rubber as it is , yes . So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech <disfmarker> We got <disfmarker> we've we've got thirteen point seven Yeah . and we've got it in at the moment and if <disfmarker> and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . Yeah . But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well . Do you reckon a two ? Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two . <vocalsound> Okay . Two . Oh . And the next one is <disfmarker> I'll have to get it back up now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time . Yeah . Okay . Yeah , I would say so as well . Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess . <vocalsound> <gap> . It does , yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yep . Say about a three maybe ? I don't know . <vocalsound> Yeah , m um <disfmarker> Maybe two ? Yeah , it was just doing it quite well . Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , Yep . but the moment , as it stands , it's um <disfmarker> Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable . It's a two . The product is a recognisable real <disfmarker> r uh <disfmarker> reaction product ? Yeah , this is <disfmarker> Uh <gap> the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , This <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . Oh . Okay . So <gap> sort of <disfmarker> Is it sort of a recognisable product . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> S <vocalsound> Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine . What do y Also it's kind of <gap> spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than <disfmarker> kinda sleek and new age . Yeah . Um , it depends which way you look at it . Uh-huh . Okay . So we're going for a two , So <disfmarker> Maybe a kind of three ? Uh d Two or three ? <gap> three ? Yeah , two or three . Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . Sure . <vocalsound> But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . Yeah . And it does have attributes that other products do . Two ? Aye . Go for it . Right , okay . Two or three . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Two . <vocalsound> How <disfmarker> Right , come on . Two . Okay . That's that decided . Right . So <disfmarker> Right . So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then <disfmarker> Yeah . What does <disfmarker> what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate <gap> or anything ? <vocalsound> Yeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be <disfmarker> I'm just gonna do this in my head . About a two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Two . One point eight isn't it or something . <vocalsound> I think , anyway . So yeah , pretty close to a two . Yeah , so it's <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> So it's <disfmarker> I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad . Yep . So should we get <disfmarker> So are <gap> definite <disfmarker> Two b two b two <gap> , yeah . Was it <disfmarker> thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if <gap> has . <vocalsound> Yes . Yeah . Okay , so we need to <disfmarker> Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances <vocalsound> Okay , well I put it back on . So I guess this <disfmarker> Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? <vocalsound> I'm not sure . <vocalsound> <gap> we'll probably have to re-rate it . Yes , I would've thought so . Yeah , yeah Yeah . we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going . Okay , so what was it , control uh F_ eight , wasn't it ? Ah it's on . <gap> it's come on already . Oh . Oh . How kind . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right , okay . So , you can see there that the <disfmarker> If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item . Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , That's right . which gets us um <disfmarker> In <disfmarker> right within the budget range . Mm . Which gets you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes . Yeah , I think that'd be fine . Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway . So that's eleven point seven , Yeah . and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . Different different colours , yeah . Alright . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . Possibly , yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , so <disfmarker> And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the <disfmarker> maybe kind of <disfmarker> So we're going for plastic , yes ? <vocalsound> Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but <disfmarker> Yep . Oh yeah , and that would now be <disfmarker> And then <disfmarker> Yeah , that's that's within the budget . Um <disfmarker> Do we actually have <disfmarker> Do we just have one special <disfmarker> uh <gap> special forms down here ? Well , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> You got special colour . Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour . Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons . <vocalsound> And we we've we've got <disfmarker> we've got enough for another Yeah . <disfmarker> we've got nought point eight left , so we've got enough for another <disfmarker> Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special <disfmarker> Yeah , um <disfmarker> So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . But the <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> but but the <disfmarker> The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because <gap> the volume buttons are different , Yeah . I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . Alright . So , special colour , you want three in there . Yeah , which I think we should <disfmarker> Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price . Okay . Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe . <vocalsound> That makes sense . Okay , uh that's probably it . Okay . Yeah . So we only ne we only need two for that . Okay . 'Cause I mean these these are moulded . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it . Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . Right . And we've got special form <vocalsound> is the one apple . The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be <disfmarker> You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Ne uh <disfmarker> Was that the idea ? Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit . Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Yeah , that <disfmarker> Then there's a spe a second special form . Uh-huh . I would have thought that's probably about r <vocalsound> well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Well you got you got twelve . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so tha So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three , Right . so we're still within budget on that . Um <disfmarker> Yep , that makes sense . So <gap> decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , Yep . but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the <disfmarker> I woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two . That's without <vocalsound> <disfmarker> So shall we do a <disfmarker> Well , um <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> And specially it definitely could fits the the real product <disfmarker> What was the <disfmarker> what's the company name ? Real Reactions ? Real Reaction produ R yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . I'm not quite sure , what does that mean ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on <disfmarker> Yeah , so <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Yep <vocalsound> So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be <vocalsound> a different shape . I would s Like we got a cherry one . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . <vocalsound> I don't know . That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different <disfmarker> <vocalsound> seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so Um <disfmarker> You mean of <disfmarker> <disfmarker> And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , I don't know . Mm-hmm . Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you're making a red apple . Yeah so it's a <gap> <disfmarker> Well you could <disfmarker> So next year you could make <disfmarker> next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . Yeah . Whatever fruit was in fashion next year . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . <vocalsound> Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . <vocalsound> And that <vocalsound> amount <disfmarker> Okay . So , we've <disfmarker> what have we what have we rid of . We got rid of the plastic . Yeah , we've <disfmarker> the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? Is it <disfmarker> That <disfmarker> yeah , that was uh <disfmarker> The rubber . that was just about all . Yeah . I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> But uh <disfmarker> So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some <disfmarker> maybe lost something on the innovation side ? I dunno . And <gap> that is like the most standard type of button . So I mean , we've got <disfmarker> we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . Yeah . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so <disfmarker> Well , ease has certainly stayed . Yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ? Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um <disfmarker> Do you think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . And the speech feature . Yeah , the speech feature . <vocalsound> And then , the corporate identity . I think we've cut just about the same . We've maybe lost <disfmarker> Hasn't it <disfmarker> It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect <disfmarker> How it would play out , yeah . Yeah . Oh . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . <vocalsound> I mean , it's maybe not . I mean <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , well I mean <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't see how we could make it any more . Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . We cou Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But then what colour would you make the R_s ? <gap> just the the company logo . So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off . Well , but you've got the company logo on there , Yeah . which would effectively be a stick-on badge . Okay . So you're <disfmarker> in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . Yeah . And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on . Yeah , yeah . Hey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or <disfmarker> I'm still not quite sure we've established that . No , I just <disfmarker> Don't think so . We got the logo off the web browser . But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . Oh right . <vocalsound> There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , Hmm . <gap> so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . So basically , even if you had a silver <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . Mm . <vocalsound> And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it . Okay . Uh-huh . 'Cause you've got sort of <disfmarker> we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . You could put in another <disfmarker> Another colour . Or would that be t Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Yeah . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . Okay . So you were talking about uh um <disfmarker> We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Which m may or may not be the case . Yeah . Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Well , yeah . <vocalsound> Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? Um , I don't think they would really need to be . I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . Yeah , maybe we've m <vocalsound> Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well . Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want . Hmm . And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a <disfmarker> plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start . Yeah . I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . Yeah , well <disfmarker> So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important . Alright . Okay . 'Cause you <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . So we just add that to profitability in effect . So <disfmarker> Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> I mean so we've dropped the cost , but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Right , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes . Same sort of function ? The criteria ? It's alright . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Just made a load of money . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> <gap> le lemon sh Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? I think <disfmarker> well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . <vocalsound> On the volume ones ? <vocalsound> Right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , <gap> . Or something like that . Yeah . <vocalsound> That's good . <vocalsound> Definitely lemon shaped . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Did <disfmarker> did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? Or was it the other way around ? You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . Right , okay . Mm-hmm . So I think we can <disfmarker> we're okay . So we're okay this way around . Yeah . So that <disfmarker> so we've saved Until the design team comes in and says , get off . <vocalsound> But you are the design team . <vocalsound> Then we say it's fine , so it's all good . Saved two Euros on that . So what bit are we on to ? Um , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? And did we make it a cherry officially ? Yeah . I th I th <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Oh . Right , okay . Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I . So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them . M but it really has to fit into the budget , Right . so <disfmarker> I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the <disfmarker> Which is fair enough . <vocalsound> And we seem to have <gap> least something in each criteria . Yeah . We haven't completely left anything out , so <disfmarker> Yeah , I think most <disfmarker> <vocalsound> As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . Yeah . Yep . So do we have anything else to discuss ? <vocalsound> I don't know . What's on the agenda ? Right , okay um <disfmarker> What's happened here ? Right , okay um <disfmarker> Mm <vocalsound> . Right , okay um , <gap> <disfmarker> Right . So we got <disfmarker> We've got the closing . So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the <disfmarker> We've done the redesign . So we're now on to project process . Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . So what did you <disfmarker> and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , um <disfmarker> Finish your meeting now . <vocalsound> We should just go through this quickly and then <disfmarker> Huh . Yeah . So <disfmarker> I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do . Okay . So , uh I think I have to finish that page . Oh . <vocalsound> Right , okay , so <disfmarker> Project evaluation . So , um <disfmarker> Creativity . Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves <vocalsound> well enough ? <vocalsound> Um , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Well um <disfmarker> I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . Individual meetings . How do you mean ? Yeah . Well , we were finding out various things in <vocalsound> in be in-between the meetings , In you on your own . and they didn't <disfmarker> the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of <disfmarker> we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , Um <disfmarker> and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of <disfmarker> you'd probably present it at one or something like that . Mm , <gap> <disfmarker> The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would <disfmarker> normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Yeah . Then you go away . You find out information . You then come back . You then discuss it . You then go and change things around , Uh-huh . and then go back . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah , I suppose and then <gap> be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant . <vocalsound> Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , Yeah . so it's not uh well uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've put , seemed okay . Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject <disfmarker> given subject um sometimes disjointed . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . Yeah , the thing itself . Um <disfmarker> I can't think of a better example at the minute . Yeah . Have <disfmarker> could have used a different example <disfmarker> pel to increase <disfmarker> create <disfmarker> Creativity . Yeah . Is this go <disfmarker> It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . Mm-hmm . You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so <disfmarker> Yeah . But <gap> think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . I mean this one seems <gap> . From the website it looks <gap> it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we <vocalsound> that's , you know , fifteen quid . <vocalsound> <gap> one of those things . Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and <disfmarker> I th I uh d <gap> I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and <gap> have like a brief to kind of <disfmarker> But the other thing is that uh they're <disfmarker> I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer Yeah . um <vocalsound> for um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you <disfmarker> normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . Mm-hmm . So what she's doing is she's <vocalsound> having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . And then you <disfmarker> or the idea is that the <disfmarker> whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to <disfmarker> either give them directly <disfmarker> give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . So uh , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um <disfmarker> to enable it to work . And of course , you had the machine crashing Hmm . Yeah . and various things going wrong . So <disfmarker> Well , sh <gap> we look at the last slide , Mm-hmm . see if it's got anything else . <gap> I think there's one one more to go . Alright , so we've got uh Yeah . <gap> I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . New ideas found , And <disfmarker> did we find any , no . It was quite good with this um <disfmarker> the white board , having that and the digital pens . Like , that's something that made it a little easier . Alright . Yeah . Yeah . Leadership , teamwork . <gap> we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . I've never seen one of them before . <gap> batteries , I think . So <disfmarker> <gap> voice recognition , especially not <gap> could <disfmarker> Does <disfmarker> Mm yeah . You've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls . Yeah . Yeah . Well it's a different application of it . Mm-hmm . Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . Okay , Mm . so how do you reckon teamwork went ? Um <disfmarker> That went okay , yeah . Yeah , I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . Mm-hmm , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> To uh go uh reasonably well . Okay . <vocalsound> I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything <disfmarker> Bit <disfmarker> bit arbitrary . <vocalsound> Well , I mean I don't think it <disfmarker> I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , Mm-hmm . and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . <vocalsound> So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . <vocalsound> Surely they they should produ Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it . And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing . Yeah . <vocalsound> But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager . You were the leader . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Now , I'd much rather be in marketing <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . <vocalsound> However , um <disfmarker> Alright uh means , so whiteboard um <disfmarker> so really , it's uh equipment . Oh . Yeah . It worked . Yeah , very nice . <vocalsound> Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But I mean , I d I don't <disfmarker> I'm not sure I see the value in these . I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug <gap> the computer or something ? I think there's a little there's a little um chi So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so <disfmarker> There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something Should we quickly look at the last slide ? and it produces a <disfmarker> Sh <gap> <disfmarker> Right . I think you watch a video of it kind of . I don't know . Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and <disfmarker> Page after page . Right . New ideas found , so one or two . Yeah . Kinetic powered remote control . Um , what was the other one ? Voice um recognition thing . Vo yeah . <gap> um and uh voice <vocalsound> uh , was it voice activated um <disfmarker> Voice recognition , yeah . S recognition . Almost . <vocalsound> To fill in these fill in these questionnaires Pretty much . <vocalsound> Right , so , Oh no . uh are the costs within budget , yes . Is the project evaluated , yes . Uh , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then celebration . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . Is that everything ? Hmm ? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting . Yeah . Uh , so we don't re So really <disfmarker> I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere . Mind you , the the figure last was was different , but it should be poss
Okay . Uh door is closed . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . I'm listening . Right . <vocalsound> Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . <vocalsound> Great . Yo . So . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This one I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh yeah . Well alright . Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be <vocalsound> because we just uh had the meeting , but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um <disfmarker> Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . Mm-hmm . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . So <vocalsound> this time we exactly know what to decide about . <vocalsound> Alright , great . And then we'll close again . Alright . Uh <disfmarker> Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll <vocalsound> first look at your uh presentations . Alright ? Mm-hmm . Walter will uh start again this time ? Yeah , great . Yo . Alright , Trendwatch . 'Kay . <gap> <vocalsound> Right . I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . 'Kay . Uh the trends . <vocalsound> It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but <vocalsound> it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . Mm-hmm . Alright . And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . Alright . Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , Less . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and uh same for this one . <vocalsound> Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too . <vocalsound> Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . Well , yeah . So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh <disfmarker> L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . Right . <vocalsound> Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that . Easy to use ? Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh <disfmarker> Yeah ? I think that's your ta <gap> Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Yeah , I know . Well we have to choose one of them . <vocalsound> I think we have to go for the first one . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's the most important one . Mm . So <gap> we have to uh take that one . Okay . So it it <vocalsound> it isn't very important that <vocalsound> that it works easy . Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . <vocalsound> But <vocalsound> it has to look great . <vocalsound> Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh <gap> . We'll see . <vocalsound> You <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's not a very comp complicated device . Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say <gap> wow , that's real great uh great concept . Alright . 'Kay . Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . <vocalsound> So it must be very bright , very colourful . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> People like this . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we we have to think uh in this direction . So i set your mind to it . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . I am told . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh you think ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . <vocalsound> Yeah , well <disfmarker> Bananas . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh <vocalsound> well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , Mm . that looks so f really flashy Yeah . but it it is also strong . <gap> And that's uh also for the younger public . B Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different . Yeah , that's great . Yeah . But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . Yes . So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily . Mm . Yep , alright . Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we don't want uh older people , we want young people . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> So uh we're gonna turn that around . <vocalsound> We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Alright . Right ? Wood is popular . Aha . Okay . We don't want wood . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah , among the old people , yeah . Old people . So , that's it for me . Alright . Nice , uh well <gap> show us . Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way . But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . Yeah , we should change that . It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . We should move to uh something <disfmarker> Well maybe it it it is , but it doesn't look strong . So maybe <disfmarker> Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So <disfmarker> No no no . But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Also <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that . Yeah ? Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it . <vocalsound> And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . <vocalsound> Then I've uh <vocalsound> had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . Yes . And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . Mm . Yeah . But they like soft materials , Yeah . uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh Soccer fronts . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Huh ? <vocalsound> Mm . That's nice . <vocalsound> Hmm . Well I also have um several examples of uh styles , All the <gap> results ? We keep coming back to the fronts . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . Yeah . Uh <vocalsound> these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Nai . Uh no . We have these kind of things . Hmm . <vocalsound> Fruity . <vocalsound> Fruity . I don't know what exactly they are . It looks like <disfmarker> Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You also uh <vocalsound> see uh this device , it's not very round and <disfmarker> Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh <disfmarker> It's t terrible . That's true . Alright . And uh well round shapes , primary colours . You can see it all here . <vocalsound> And of course uh this famous device . Hmm ? I think as you know something uh some devices like this . Yeah , alright . So to give you an idea of uh <disfmarker> Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah . This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . Yeah , it still has a strong look . Yeah . And it's round . That's uh <disfmarker> But then you are losing your fruity colours . Yeah . Well we have to make a <disfmarker> Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . That's true . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical , but <disfmarker> But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . No , it isn't . Okay . Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . Yeah but the <disfmarker> Yes . 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but <disfmarker> But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . The feel ? The feel . Uh alright . Well <disfmarker> So , if you ti And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . Well <disfmarker> Nah yeah the feel <disfmarker> You you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Only the feel . <vocalsound> Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . <vocalsound> Right . Mm-hmm . Oh . I agree . And I <disfmarker> Then I have some more findings . Um <vocalsound> uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun . <vocalsound> And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , <vocalsound> that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh <disfmarker> That's a bit uh much . <vocalsound> <gap> No titanium . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . <vocalsound> Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium . What do you exactly mean with double curved ? Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . <gap> And uh <vocalsound> now the the shape , yeah , <gap> a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh <gap> a more modern look not plain , long box style , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I dunno . Double curved ? <vocalsound> I'll draw it , Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> It it mean <disfmarker> but maybe later . <vocalsound> Yeah , well okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh <gap> . Um anyway <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um <vocalsound> uh speak uh speech uh controlled <vocalsound> device . Yeah right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But <disfmarker> It's worth the trouble I think , Well <disfmarker> The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . because <disfmarker> Because people like that . This soft material thing from uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . Yeah . Right . Uh soft enough . Yeah . Right . Yeah . So that's uh basically what I want to talk about . Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay . Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , <vocalsound> um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now . <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> Um it's not really speech recognition , That's interesting . it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah . Oh okay . <gap> Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . Right . No it doesn't does not do anything . No . Oh . But i it's just a <disfmarker> That's a bit uh <disfmarker> But that that makes it cheap . It's <vocalsound> it's just a an extra function , Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah it's it's cheap . Yes . I understand . and it's cheap . But <vocalsound> it has no functionality for our remote at all . No but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> No but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . Yeah , right . <vocalsound> But it it's n nice for young people . Young people love them . Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um <disfmarker> They like gadgets . Yeah , ple Yeah . Right . If it's cheap . Yeah . Hmm . Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . <vocalsound> Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and <gap> uh and that kind of stuff <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example , <vocalsound> but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . <vocalsound> Alright . Can you draw it now of uh <disfmarker> How <disfmarker> How <disfmarker> Hmm ? Can you draw it now ? Ah . Well I have the <disfmarker> I can draw it again , and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the <gap> . Um <disfmarker> Mm . Alright . How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? <vocalsound> Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the <disfmarker> Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . Yeah right . Yes . <vocalsound> Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . <gap> button , yeah . Just uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> There is already a blank . Yes ? So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm so have I . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nah . <gap> . <gap> You have to push hard . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I suggest a banana shape . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Because of the fruity uh fashion . Yeah . Yeah . No m Next year that's out . <vocalsound> Yellow and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . Yeah . Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? Yeah just uh the numbers . <vocalsound> And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? <gap> These these will be bigger in the the real design . <vocalsound> Alright , yeah . This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus Yeah . and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button , You've <disfmarker> Yes . because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . Right . And what's the menu button ? And you you need a you need a speaker . Um it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> For the <disfmarker> <gap> Hmm ? This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But how did <disfmarker> How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . Well we we can add another button here , but <disfmarker> Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh <disfmarker> Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . Yes , well but bec because when you <vocalsound> push Menu you get in , Yeah ? Yeah ? and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . Ah right . Yeah . Well you you <disfmarker> But you can men you can press menu again to get out . Well that's also the Okay button . That's you you should have uh <disfmarker> No no , No . we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button . Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out . Exit . Exit <gap> . Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . Well , it's just a choice . You have uh redundancy . But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . <gap> Or don't <disfmarker> Yeah , if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? Where would you put it ? Well they that could be anywhere . That's very small . It could be uh down here . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Um . Well , not here . I <vocalsound> yeah I suggest here . But that's just a little <vocalsound> gap . Yeah . Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . Microphone , yeah . Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . <vocalsound> Yeah I understand . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . But <disfmarker> Huh ? Alright . Alright . Yeah ? Okay . This is my suggested design . Well , okay , alright . Um <disfmarker> Yes . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . I'd <disfmarker> I agree . Yeah , fine . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Fine . <vocalsound> Move on . <vocalsound> Well yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . Oh , um I had some uh examples . <vocalsound> I can live with it . You can uh <disfmarker> Yes ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> I did not like it very much , but <disfmarker> Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Too big . <vocalsound> Yeah . They do they don't look fruity enough . <vocalsound> Nei They're n they're not trendy . No , well th They're all black . Yeah . Well not all . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hey , that one I like . <vocalsound> Uh this is for children but <vocalsound> th Tho Yeah those <disfmarker> It doesn't look strong . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . No . But it doesn't uh the <disfmarker> W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to . <vocalsound> The remote . <vocalsound> Yeah right . Yeah , ok Yeah . Well this is a terrible <disfmarker> Terrible . This is just crazy . <vocalsound> But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? It's it's all too much buttons . Um this looks <disfmarker> Too many buttons . Yeah . That's <disfmarker> This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but <disfmarker> Nah th It's too expensive . I don't know uh <disfmarker> Well , that's too expensive I think . Too expensive ? Yeah . Alright . Well <disfmarker> Nah . But it <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> Alright . Yeah . Okay . Ha , even more . N Huh . Mm no . <vocalsound> But are we going for a strange uh form ? 'Kay . No , not very strange . 'Cause people like that . Not not too strange . No . Not too strange . You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . It still has t Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand . I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . Well <disfmarker> Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah . You know ? <gap> Well I have at home <vocalsound> a remote with a bridge . It's just a half round half half circle at <disfmarker> And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . That's <disfmarker> It feels comfortable . Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . Exotic yeah . Yeah , different . We have t Yeah , yeah . Yeah . I will design it , we design it later . Y yis So we'll get to that later I guess . Alright . Great . Yeah , alright . Um where did I put it ? The specific shape . The <disfmarker> Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . <vocalsound> I got this from our friends . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh yeah the conceptual design . <vocalsound> Our sources . These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story . Um <disfmarker> Your bag . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? <vocalsound> Um where <disfmarker> No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um <disfmarker> B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ? But uh we should decide now . Yes , but we have to decide about these now . Ah right . Yeah . Materials are the most , most impor And uh the trend-watching . So as you said , fruity is in , well <gap> sells good . <vocalsound> Wow . Yeah . Uh these things . So we have to uh put it in one uh document . <vocalsound> Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them <disfmarker> Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Not everything . Well we have to decide all these things ? Yeah but <vocalsound> all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . Yeah well uh <disfmarker> W we can uh override them ? Why should I uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest <disfmarker> Well what do I suggest actually ? <vocalsound> What what kind of properties should it have ? <vocalsound> Uh s solid , Well we just listened . I think we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah . Yeah . Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . Do you know the new uh <disfmarker> That <disfmarker> Just like um most cell phones are . Yeah , I understand . No <vocalsound> no <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So we have titanium . <vocalsound> The front is the most important . <vocalsound> Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look . Yeah . You know what ? And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it . Yeah . But the feel of plastic isn't strong . <vocalsound> No but you have titanium of course . No but you you have this <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh you have the best of both worlds . Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay . Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium . <gap> And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium . Yeah . <vocalsound> Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas Yeah . Yeah of course , but yeah <vocalsound> you have to make a decision . And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . Yeah , but it it's expensive . I guess so . Uh titanium I sh I think uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Bendable . Huh ? <vocalsound> Bendable . Well , well the <disfmarker> Well any colour <gap> <disfmarker> According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh <disfmarker> Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . Yeah . Mm . The plastic is is the colour you want it . Paint spray . Mm . Yeah alright . So <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . So , Alright . we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? I've uh <disfmarker> Yeah , Mm . I think that's a nice trade-off . Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . Yeah , great . Yeah . I <disfmarker> Um solid feel and trendy look . Alright . So material , um hard plastic Yeah , for the front for the front ? and then titanium for the back . Yeah . For the non-removable uh part . But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . Well but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You know ? Well titanium is neutral . <vocalsound> The titan titanium isn't isn't v very <disfmarker> Yeah , i it doesn't uh <vocalsound> curves . <vocalsound> I understand . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No uh I nei . <vocalsound> Titanium is very <disfmarker> No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . Hmm . Yeah . Alright . I dunno if if you disagree , Well <disfmarker> but I think it's doesn't matter very much . Yeah . Alright . Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , <vocalsound> Funky customers . and they don't use uh wood . And even if it does uh doesn't match , it will uh <disfmarker> People like mm colours that don't match . Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> Okay . And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh <gap> . <vocalsound> Cop copper uh material . Yeah . Excuse me ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The electrical cable uh does <disfmarker> It's uh from uh our coffee uh <disfmarker> Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh <disfmarker> No we don't use an electrical cable . <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine . Yeah in <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh <disfmarker> Of course . Yeah , but that's not what's meant here , I think . <vocalsound> Nei . <gap> So external . <vocalsound> Oh external ? Yeah . Yeah . Well <gap> <vocalsound> A coffee grind doesn't have <disfmarker> Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind . Well uh <vocalsound> all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right ? <vocalsound> The chip is normal silicon . <vocalsound> Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . <vocalsound> Okay ? Alright . Mm-hmm . So that's just easy . Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our <vocalsound> earlier uh remotes . The conceptual specification of the user interface ? Um well we have our beautiful drawing . <vocalsound> Alright . Well I got a better one here and I will um <disfmarker> Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , The shared folder . and then I'll put it in our end report . I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting . Yes , you can <disfmarker> Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . Okay . Um the trend-watching <disfmarker> <gap> included these days . <vocalsound> And what do we ? We thing that fruit and bright colours are <disfmarker> Yeah the the the front w I think we can launch a couple of packages . You can buy a different kind of of of machine , Yeah . but it's the same thing , but with another front . Yes . Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . Yeah that's the whole idea of the front . And you can you can <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Uh those kind of things . Yes . Yeah right . But that's for later on . The fronts y you can do anything with them . Yeah . Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini <disfmarker> Yeah , right <disfmarker> For the uh initiative uh launch . Yeah . For the for the launch , yeah . It's good marketing . Mm . Launch different lines at once . So e th then a c couple of basic colours . Not not very uh <vocalsound> sim Not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , n not too heavy . You can always take another pick . <vocalsound> Yeah . We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time . <vocalsound> They have to buy it later on . <vocalsound> Yeah . Oh yeah . Yeah . <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah right . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Come on . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> More basic . We still have to make those fifty million , yeah ? <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very boring , yeah . Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , The most boring fronts possible . The most ugly . so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more . Yeah , right . Two . Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , Red red , blue and green you give them or something , and and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . And uh <disfmarker> and then you can give them <gap> uh other ones . Yeah . Alright . Um well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike . Uh this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh <vocalsound> well introduce our remote . Uh we still have to make <disfmarker> We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . <vocalsound> Because yeah we have the sketch but <disfmarker> Yeah . But we we must remember that <vocalsound> fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . Yes . Else it w won't sell . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Yes . Alright , yeah . Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get <disfmarker> Where is my mouse ? Uh where is my mouse ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Lost my mouse . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Um this is it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Unbelievable . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , um this we have . Yeah . Uh basic stuff . Interface we have . Supplements , L_C_D_ . Maybe a a cheap voice recording . Well <disfmarker> Yeah we should do that . The price ? Yes . Alright . Individual actions . We all agree on that . Yeah . Mm . Industry designer , <gap> . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . Yeah , we can do that . Together or uh <disfmarker> Yeah together . Yeah togeth <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's what I got uh to hear . How <disfmarker> Yeah yeah , but how do I <disfmarker> But bu we stay we stay here or something ? Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think . <vocalsound> But I think so . <vocalsound> You can take the SMARTboard . <vocalsound> Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it <disfmarker> Ah right . <vocalsound> This is the SMARTboard , so <disfmarker> And take it to our rooms and uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype , and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera . Ah , specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . <vocalsound> Yeah . So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Have fun <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Some <disfmarker> Some non functional tasks . <vocalsound> yeah project evaluation . So um <disfmarker> 'Kay . <gap> , what are you going to do ? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications . We don't have produ product yet , so kind of difficult . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's why I uh <disfmarker> But uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You're fired . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> How long do we still have ? <vocalsound> Well , can we talk about something else ? Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> Uh no I don't know anything , <gap> Ajax . Nah . but maybe uh anyone else uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah ? Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? Um round . Round I think . Yeah . Round . Yeah I I I also uh thought <disfmarker> Yeah . To make it as uh as round as possible . And these uh these s these buttons <vocalsound> uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped Why does <disfmarker> Curvy . Yeah . So you can see you have to up or down . with a square one in the middle . Ah f fuck you . Yeah . Yeah . But now I see the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And this must be uh volume I think , Heh ? and this programme . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We can't get <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think . Well th th th th th that depends uh . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , it depends , but <disfmarker> Well we uh <disfmarker> If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . <vocalsound> We we j we'll just give them an uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's right . We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it . Yeah . Yeah alright . Yeah . Okay . Ts It doesn't work any more . We can't save them . So we'll just have them uh standing there . Yeah , I noticed . You can't uh click the corners . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a bit uh bit a pity . It's a real real great thing . <vocalsound> Well we still have uh more than five minutes . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> what are we going to do ? <vocalsound> I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Let's start the design . Oh we can uh decide how we implement <vocalsound> the feeling from our company into the remote . Well yeah . Um I think um <vocalsound> a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be <disfmarker> Mm . Also the slogan ? On the <disfmarker> Yeah , why not ? <vocalsound> If there's enough space , <vocalsound> you can put uh <disfmarker> Uh I I'd say only the logo . We'll we'll <disfmarker> O Yeah . Me too . Too much text and it gets too too busy . Well , our slogan is not very long . It's just a simple <disfmarker> What is it ? <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> it's quite a long phrase . We put the fashion in electronics . We put the fashion in electronics . But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You c <vocalsound> But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the <disfmarker> Yeah , right . Ah the logo should be on the top I think . The logo <disfmarker> On the top . Yeah . Well in in in the right top corner ? Yeah they do . Well yeah . Yeah . Right corner , yes . And well you c Right corner , On the back , you can put uh h <vocalsound> At the bottom , you can put the logo with the <disfmarker> or maybe here in the middle ? <gap> uh the text ? Yeah . Yeah . But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . Just just small . Uh yeah , at the back ? Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , Well you c Well uh <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah well <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . and you can remove the front . You can <disfmarker> The logo can be on on every uh front . Yeah , but you can scratch it off or something . It's better if you have it uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah <vocalsound> push it in or something . Carved into the material . <vocalsound> No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back . I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . <vocalsound> But <vocalsound> am I the only one , or uh <disfmarker> Yeah , on the backside . Well , management would like it . <vocalsound> Well n n not not on the front side , I think . The front side , no no l no slogan . No not on the front , but on the backside . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> On the back <disfmarker> Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , Sorry . <vocalsound> so that it is always be there . I think it's a nice idea , <vocalsound> to make it more recognisable , Yeah . that the next to the logo you have the slogan . Yeah . I agree . To make more uh of an impression . But not too big . Just uh <disfmarker> Not too big . No , very small . Not <vocalsound> on the entire back , Yeah . <vocalsound> but uh just very small . <vocalsound> But readable enough of course . Okay . Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design . Yeah I think over here the logo . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Lo Uh yeah . Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later . and logo also on the front but not exchange uh <disfmarker> Uh ? Hmm ? <vocalsound> <gap> Uh when changing fronts . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Alright , that's decided . Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium ? O on the front ? Five minutes left . Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , Yes we could <disfmarker> <gap> the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So <disfmarker> So a bit of titanium between ? Yeah . Yeah . No no betwe of between That's a bit <disfmarker> Oh that that's that's pretty cool . we can do but <disfmarker> But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that <disfmarker> No , they have two fronts , No no no no . that . You you can <disfmarker> You have to make this titanium too . No ? Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . This enti entire bottom ? Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . Yeah . Yes . Like dust in it and so things like that . Yeah . When you exchange all the fronts and it's open . <vocalsound> I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile . No , you can you can just <disfmarker> And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something . And then the lower part is titanium ? This is titanium . I think that's nice , yeah . Yeah . Some some kind of wei weight in it . Yeah . And this is uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Round forms . F front . Yeah . I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . With the with the curved edge . Yep . A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone . Maybe you can show it . Yeah . It also has the those <vocalsound> two distinct uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Tada . Mm bit like this . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , Uh it's uh <disfmarker> you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is . Because it has to be uh there all the time you know . What ? <vocalsound> Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Ah . That uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Maybe a nice touch , yeah . So round where ? So uh a little corner of titanium . Yeah , that's nice finishing touch you need . Oh , yeah . Yes , <gap> that also sounds uh pretty uh neat . <gap> So this this is the exchangeable part . I think I'm going to buy it . <vocalsound> We want it . Yeah , this is the front . And it's only f twenty five Euros . <vocalsound> Come on . That's a bit too much , but <disfmarker> No , no no no , No that's nothing . but <vocalsound> I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually . The Phillips remote uh costs more . <vocalsound> Of course , because it's my design but <disfmarker> Right . No our d our design , alright . My design . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Taking all the credit . <vocalsound> Well uh you two are going to work together . You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , and then uh <vocalsound> you uh <disfmarker> Yeah . We'll stay here I guess ? But there's a problem . We can't uh take a blank one . Or can we ? Well I think we can , I just <gap> <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . Yeah . Nah that's alright , that's alright . Uh the fourth one . But don't erase my cat . <vocalsound> Yeah , o Uh the fourth one is empty , isn't it ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Oh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I want to preserve it . <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> <gap> This one is empty . Yeah . <vocalsound> You have to empty one huh ? Oh , we have a <gap> one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What are you doing chief ? So , you can uh draw a <disfmarker> Yeah . Alright . Yeah I think we have to wait ? Well I'll get a <disfmarker> I'll get the message . Yeah No <disfmarker> until the until the beep goes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But I don't uh <disfmarker> Do we have to stay here , <vocalsound> or I think we have to return first . No , I think uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Well you'll <disfmarker> Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here . <gap> Maybe . Or get your mouse . Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates . The high powers from above <vocalsound> will have to tell us , yeah . Yeah . It's not relaxing . I always have a mouse next to my laptop . I hate these <disfmarker> I I don't have a laptop . Yeah , touch-pads , yeah . Ugh . We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah right . <vocalsound> No just kidding . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Dream on . <vocalsound> Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , because it becomes too too too too stressy . And in your remote control . So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Aha . This has no function . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Half <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so <disfmarker> No . But they do want some gadgets . It's all about cool things . So that's wha what we're doing . Yeah . And it will sell . <vocalsound> We will be rich . Bless you . <vocalsound> Well we won't . Our bosses will be rich . Mm . We've done too much in the previous meetings . Too much ? Yes , we've got nothing to do now . <vocalsound> Well they uh <disfmarker> Well , that's not bad , is it ? No . I think that's good . We all had uh our talk and we agree I guess on uh several thing , on most uh on things . Mm . Its the best remote ever . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Pinball . Oh <gap> . Oh he's totally off again . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> No man . You just have to push harder . Yeah you have to push harder . <vocalsound> But when I start here , it's here . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . So is it <disfmarker> Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand , <vocalsound> and I don't think that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Hmm . <vocalsound> Recalibrate it . Nope . <vocalsound> Where's the good old chalk board with the the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We can better uh draw a design on this . <vocalsound> Yeah , maybe . Yeah , but we can't . Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh <vocalsound> goes off again . Yeah . Let's go . Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Finish meeting now . Finish the meeting now . Alright now we know what to do , so We'll stay here ? Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh . Or we'll get the email . <vocalsound> Message ? Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ? No , get away . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Huh ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Guess so . Um I I'm not sure . Maybe you <disfmarker> Yeah . Well you'll have to work on this one . Well we'll wait a few seconds Yeah . That's a good idea . and then we'll get an email . Alright . Have fun lads . Well <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> A happy hol happy holidays . <vocalsound> Good luck . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
Mm-hmm . Mm yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> I g yeah . Time is it ? <vocalsound> Fourteen twenty six . Okay . Lovely to see you all again . Um <vocalsound> it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . Um okay <vocalsound> our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . Okay . So opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . <vocalsound> And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece <vocalsound> and a long-life battery or a charging station . Okay , now three presentations . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials <vocalsound> um and then the conceptual specification of user interface <vocalsound> and finally trend watching . That would be me . Yep . Alright . Well . Mm . 'kay . Function F_ eight it . There we go . Alright . Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . <vocalsound> Um . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , Mm . or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . <vocalsound> Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here . <vocalsound> Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um <vocalsound> using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um <vocalsound> complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . Hmm . Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . <vocalsound> So those are our options . Um personal preferences that I was thinking through <disfmarker> here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . And we wanna go for simplicity . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything Mm . any ideas on that ? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . <vocalsound> Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . <vocalsound> But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . That's what I have for options . Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing . <vocalsound> Is double-curved like <disfmarker> would be like two hands kind of thing ? I'm not sure . I haven't received any specific <vocalsound> Okay . visuals of this yet . 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve This is what I'm sort of <disfmarker> and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , <vocalsound> Yeah . but I've no idea . I'm not sure , but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . Sounds good . Yeah , I wonder <disfmarker> I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . But the titanium , they were quite <disfmarker> they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Space-age remote . Mm-hmm . Just all things to keep in mind . <vocalsound> Just an interesting marketing kind of element . Yeah . <vocalsound> That's about all I have to do , guys . I hope I didn't go through that too quickly . Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you <disfmarker> Yeah , n no idea , no idea . no idea , okay . Um I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , Mm-hmm . and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , Mm-hmm . um but other than <disfmarker> that's really basic , <gap> I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . <vocalsound> Okay . Alright ? Any other questions ? Uh-huh . Don't think so . No ? Okay . Mm 'kay . I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look Thank you , perfect . and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh <disfmarker> Thanks . Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um <disfmarker> underneath our <disfmarker> Just in my notebook , oh , uh in your book , then don't worry about that . but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . Alright ? Uh I guess I can <disfmarker> 'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , um . This one's so much tighter than the other one . <vocalsound> I know . Okay . Nope . There we go . Here you are . Jess . G oh , geez . Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . Um other <disfmarker> we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include <disfmarker> that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how <disfmarker> <vocalsound> what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool . So basically , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> that's what we don't want . <vocalsound> M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple . Here's a a fairly simple device . Hmm . This is an an iPod from Apple . Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . It's very minimalistic in its design . Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . Um <vocalsound> the thing I like about this is that it's very very quick to access the main features . Uh you can just about make out uh that the button <disfmarker> three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um <vocalsound> here's a another example . This is uh <disfmarker> it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . Um it's certainly got novelty value . Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . Mm . Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of <disfmarker> yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun . So I <vocalsound> I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . Um but these are these are all necessary functions . Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . Hmm . And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . <vocalsound> Okay . So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? I think that's <vocalsound> that's one way to go , yes . Okay . Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's <disfmarker> it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . Mm-hmm . There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're <vocalsound> I <vocalsound> Right well we're <disfmarker> I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , Mm-hmm . Right . but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . The alternative is to have a <vocalsound> an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your <disfmarker> this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . Mm-hmm . I mean that that's also a good idea . Okay . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . Mm . Mm-hmm . Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make . 'Kay . I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . <vocalsound> Um and so Yeah . like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's <disfmarker> um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . Well <disfmarker> Are you are you tak Yeah . Like I I know I use that often enough . <vocalsound> Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ? Yeah . Well if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a <disfmarker> No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . Okay . Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes . Okay . But it's it's it's 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way , mm-hmm . so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . Oh , good point . Mm . Um I'm not sure . Yeah . Okay , <vocalsound> Should I plug that in ? now we're moving on to market . Marketing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is that going on ? Okay . Maybe it's just not <disfmarker> Uh that should be alright , actually . Is it on ? Ri What F_ do you have to press , five ? Eight . I just keep pressing lots of 'em . Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . <vocalsound> If anything , the <gap> that they gave me . No signal . Oops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough . Alright . There we are . Oop , there we go . Mm 'kay . Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . <vocalsound> Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So first um they had people <disfmarker> they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account . Okay . <vocalsound> The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . I don't know how much we agree with that . <vocalsound> And then <vocalsound> the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , <vocalsound> tight material . <vocalsound> S sweet . <vocalsound> And so that brings us to my personal preferences . Who wants a spongy remote or one with <vocalsound> fruit and vegetable padding . <vocalsound> Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily <vocalsound> wanna take away . <vocalsound> Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to <vocalsound> like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . <vocalsound> But <vocalsound> it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That <disfmarker> there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> that pretty much sums it up . So yeah . Okay , do we have any <disfmarker> s some questions for this , let's see um . Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ? Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? <gap> Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands . If it's latex <disfmarker> if it's latexy <disfmarker> It's kind of <disfmarker> and then it <disfmarker> Um , mean <disfmarker> A kind of thing that <disfmarker> we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , I dunno . An uh I <disfmarker> if <disfmarker> th <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , Mm-hmm . which is spongier and softer on your hands . It's <disfmarker> there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to <disfmarker> R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . and and <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess something grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . <vocalsound> yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , Yeah . so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called . Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's <disfmarker> that seems doable . <vocalsound> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , F for sure , <vocalsound> or maybe like li um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . The buttons could be fruit-shaped . Could they be smelly ? <vocalsound> I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something . <vocalsound> Oh God . <vocalsound> Oh well I don't know . <vocalsound> it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot Or carrot shaped , mm . isn't it ? <vocalsound> Maybe , Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . <vocalsound> Like large button , or <disfmarker> that's what I was thinking of , yeah . What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . <gap> be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Kind of like a potato . yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think . <vocalsound> Just to tie it in a little . Might <disfmarker> would you think you you <disfmarker> do you think you'd be able to hold it ? 'Cause I think the reason they're long is <disfmarker> yeah . It'd be harder to press button . Depends . Harder to push . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? Yeah . Or your fingers ? Um <disfmarker> I usually hold it in one hand . Maybe <disfmarker> Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , I <disfmarker> so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . Yeah , that's ts how I tend to do it . But then the buttons would have to be very small . Yeah , Don't you think ? 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . No just thumb-sized . Jus But I like i But I mean in order to get to all of them , Yeah <vocalsound> . you know . Yeah . They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . Maybe . That's true . But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . Right . I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb Yeah , Mm-hmm . or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . and <disfmarker> And you find that works quite well ? I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . Yeah Mm-hmm . Is that <disfmarker> 'Cause th The button on an iPod , is it <disfmarker> what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? It's like five , It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . 'cause there's one in the middle . It <disfmarker> wel well <vocalsound> yeah , it would <disfmarker> I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . but <disfmarker> Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . Ts Right . and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . Oh , I see , right , yeah . Oh , okay . Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah . Yeah , that's quite a good design . I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . Yeah . Like just the idea of like those <disfmarker> so few buttons for main things , Uh uh t but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ , Yeah . 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? Hmm . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . And then you could still have that available . Yeah , I think an <vocalsound> L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . I think it could be difficult in practice , yeah . Yeah . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right . and people don't wanna do that . Um <disfmarker> Okay um Oh we probably have to get going , we have we've about fifteen minutes left , don't we ? so I'm I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this <disfmarker> these kinds of things , <vocalsound> 'Kay . so I'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . Could <disfmarker> Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , Like , to make it different fruits . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's possible . Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex Exactly . wherea but the actual model could be titanium . And you could co-ordinate with your house <vocalsound> or whatever . I think maybe th the packaging , All these options . it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , Ooh . and the remote control's inside . <vocalsound> Well , there we go . Oh . <vocalsound> Don't know . <vocalsound> Ah hmm hmm hmm . The iPod packaging is me like was so <disfmarker> that was like half the fun . It's like the way it all comes all cute . Yeah . Mm . Options . Lemons ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> components concept . Energy , chip on print . Uh-hu oh , oh yes . Right , G I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get <disfmarker> be necessary but um <disfmarker> That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So Alright , can you just explain what that is real quick ? so um decisions , what the <disfmarker> okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . Mm-hmm . Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? <vocalsound> I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . Am I <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , I mean , it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . Yeah . Yeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , but as far as I know , the technology is good . Right , I haven't gotten any <disfmarker> Costs . yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . But over time <disfmarker> Um circuit boards . Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . They're <vocalsound> they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . <vocalsound> I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done . Okay . Um yeah , I can't can't really tell you . I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . <vocalsound> But I don't know any decisions on <disfmarker> If they're if they're really options . Yeah . I'm sorry , I did f Okay . Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Uh it's fairly fairly standard . Yeah . Um okay , then we'll move on to the case . Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . Right . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that . Um , <vocalsound> 'kay , the pushbutton <disfmarker> if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? Um I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . Oh . <vocalsound> It would be nice for changing the volume , Uh but <disfmarker> but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . I don't think it would really work . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers Yeah , it's a <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel . Yeah , th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . <vocalsound> But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be Yeah . Yeah . We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as <disfmarker> I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . Yeah . Yeah . And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out Yeah . and th no <disfmarker> it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . Yeah . Hmm . So , have a scroll for volume ? F or for all those secret functions ? F When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . I think <disfmarker> yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . Um <disfmarker> Right . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending <disfmarker> and maybe we could table that decision for later . Um . I don't know . I think w well <disfmarker> I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide <disfmarker> the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . Okay . Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case . Okay , let's do case . Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . Yeah . I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ? Uh yeah , everything I've <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that <vocalsound> there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . Mm-hmm . Okay . Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . Mm-hmm . Okay . The inside is hard . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , Ge o I think that that's done for us . Okay . 'Kay . Yeah . So we uh we do want latex . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . <vocalsound> Yeah . Fruity colours . <vocalsound> Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ? Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ? I'm thinking curved of some sort . Yeah . Yeah , okay . Yeah . We don't really know what the difference <disfmarker> Um okay , interface , the type and the supplements . So Um <disfmarker> push or scroll , right ? Yep . Or both ? Um <disfmarker> And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . Good point . So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . Mm-hmm . And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . Yeah , yeah , it's uh <vocalsound> it's it's fairly simple . I think that <disfmarker> yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll <disfmarker> an actual <disfmarker> like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , Yeah . I dunno . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so Yeah . I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case Mm-hmm . Yeah . because <disfmarker> Is that okay with you ? How you feeling ? <vocalsound> Yeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , Mm-hmm . but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . It might be cool enough . Yeah . Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , Yep . and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ? Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? Um I assume that's what else we're gonna <disfmarker> like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use . Um <disfmarker> Oh . So we're gonna have like a menu button , Yep . so that we can access on-screen things then ? Yeah . Okay , um so Alright . Um in <disfmarker> we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? Yeah . On off , On off <disfmarker> uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . So like one through five , or <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah Like a radio type sorta situation ? about <disfmarker> yeah like <disfmarker> yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um <disfmarker> Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , right ? Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers . No . I think maybe numbers seems <disfmarker> is kind of old-fashioned . Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . Yeah , yeah , you can just <disfmarker> Mm . and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , Yeah , up down . but the volume control could double for that , for example . Mm-hmm . Okay , um finishing the meeting now . Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , <vocalsound> um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . Ooh . <vocalsound> Cool . <vocalsound> Wow . Um did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? Simple chip . Yep . Okay . We are done . Thank you everyone . Oh I di these are already in our shared folder , so . Okay , cool . <vocalsound> Clay . I wasn't expecting that . <vocalsound> Clay . <vocalsound>
Alright , that did nothing . Okay . Welcome to the meeting everyone . Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show . Sorry guys . You may have to do the function F_ eight thing . I did . Twice . Oh , okay . <vocalsound> This'll just take a moment . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay okay <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or it won't . <vocalsound> Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . Okay . <vocalsound> Alright . Um . This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . <gap> I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager . <vocalsound> Hello . <vocalsound> Okay . So um . So that was the opening . <vocalsound> The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . <vocalsound> Okay . My name's Poppy . I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . Um , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . Nice to meet you Poppy . <vocalsound> My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . <vocalsound> Alright . Hi , I'm Genevieve . I'm the Marketing Expert . I'm an expert at marketing . <vocalsound> Um , I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . <vocalsound> Um , I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase . Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager , um Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But um um <disfmarker> Yeah . And uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , Which brings us to our next subject , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . Okay . So this is a television remote control ? Yes , it's a television remote control . Yeah . Right . I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . So , alright . Okay . Um , yeah . Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design . So , um , making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um <disfmarker> and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . Um , tool training . Is , is everyone , um <disfmarker> <gap> Okay . Yeah . Got those notes . Yeah . Thank you . Great . Great . Um One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> With our microphones still attached to our bodies . Okay . Gosh . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay , what's my favourite animal ? <vocalsound> Do come up . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , <gap> to go first . <vocalsound> Oh , are we all doing it individually ? This is a team-building time <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> where , um , <vocalsound> , Okay , let's stand up and support you <vocalsound> okay cool , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> right now it is an elk . An elk ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> alright , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> A vicious <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And it goes like <disfmarker> Yeah it's got like big antlers , <vocalsound> yeah . Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do you have elk where you come from ? Yes . You do . Yeah We have moose too . <vocalsound> we have moose and we have deer . Okay . <vocalsound> Do you have <disfmarker> We have sheep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sheep . Yeah , <vocalsound> <gap> 'Kay , um . <vocalsound> cows . <vocalsound> That's a great elk . Uh-oh , we have a good artist . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That is really good . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thanks . I'm quite <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This is my <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh , very shapely . Okay . Brilliant . That's a sketching of my my elk , <vocalsound> and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , <vocalsound> that um , that um <disfmarker> In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . Mm . Very nice . Yeah . Okay . Right . <vocalsound> Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . <vocalsound> Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Oh . It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bit more cartoon style . <vocalsound> But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and <vocalsound> they just know what they're doing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Basically , that's why I like cats . <vocalsound> Very good . <vocalsound> Great . <gap> I'll rub that out . There you go . <vocalsound> Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure <vocalsound> how to draw one . Ooh . I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes <vocalsound> and they're really easy to draw . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , I forget her name . right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . Tara <vocalsound> or Tara . Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a cartoon dog I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . <vocalsound> It's a scary cartoon dog . That <disfmarker> This , <vocalsound> that does not look like a dog . <vocalsound> We can pretend . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It looks kinda like a person . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm sorry . <vocalsound> That's Pinocchio . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> It's a dog . <vocalsound> . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats . <vocalsound> I've nothing against cats . Yeah , that's true . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> that don't look like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alrighty . I feel like a robot . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Um , <vocalsound> well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . At first I thought it was a dead leaf . <vocalsound> And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda <disfmarker> there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . It's kinda like a peacock . <vocalsound> Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was <disfmarker> This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah . There you go . Very nice . <vocalsound> Great . <vocalsound> Uh , what do we <disfmarker> Oh . Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? Yes I do . <vocalsound> <gap> Yea <vocalsound> Right . <vocalsound> So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , Okay . um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um <disfmarker> or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um <gap> selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um we can <disfmarker> like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty . I'm bad at math . Okay . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Um , <vocalsound> so now that , um , that is underway , um <vocalsound> it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <gap> So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? Okay . Um <disfmarker> I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . It's always , where is the remote control ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking <vocalsound> device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . <vocalsound> I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , <gap> signal , Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea . <vocalsound> 'cause it always gets lost . Do yous not find that , um , <vocalsound> like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , that you don't use half of them . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I don't know what they do . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . Yeah . Yeah , that's , that's <disfmarker> That's useful . Yeah , it is . Yeah . So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button . Yeah . Yeah . Alright . Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Any ideas will do that you have at this point . Could be shaped like a conch , Mm . <vocalsound> you know . <vocalsound> Can hold it . <vocalsound> A novelty . Be like a shell-shaped remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . Yeah . Like , I've seen phones like a <disfmarker> Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . Okay . I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . Yeah . I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . Mm-hmm . So , hmm . Yeah . And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Yeah . Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . Yeah . Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover <disfmarker> We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Yeah . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . Interface ? Industrial Designer . Industrial Designer . Oh , industrial . That's me . <vocalsound> I have to remember these things . Um . You'll be beginning your , your working design . Mm-hmm . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , <vocalsound> maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> Marketing Expert . Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? Okay . 'Kay . Thank you . <gap>
Okay . <vocalsound> Je croix que c'est dommage de le <disfmarker> it will be sad to destroy this prototype . It really looks like a banana . <vocalsound> It is a banana . It is a banana . <vocalsound> It is the essence of bananas . I would be confused with this thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . S <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . How is everyone ? Hi . Hi . So we are here for the detailed design meeting . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> we will uh <disfmarker> I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . Then uh I've <disfmarker> I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . Then we will uh evaluate the product . And uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with <disfmarker> it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . Mm-hmm . So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , <vocalsound> to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it <vocalsound> to be uh to feel spongy , Like a banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . Mm-hmm . And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . Mm-hmm . So for the financial aspect it's okay , <vocalsound> we can uh <disfmarker> we can continue with this product uh as if , <vocalsound> and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . So uh you can have my project in <disfmarker> Yeah . You have a presentation ? Uh yeah just a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Four . Participant four , yes . Evaluation . Okay . Okay . Okay . So you can go . We can go through . Okay . So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to <vocalsound> the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and <disfmarker> Okay . okay so uh we have uh six points . We we talked about before . Okay . So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , <vocalsound> easy to find in a room , and robust , Yeah . Mm-hmm . uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . Yeah . Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here , Yeah . and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ? Okay . And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see . Mm-hmm . Okay . The <disfmarker> okay ? <vocalsound> Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ? Okay . Maybe you can presen <vocalsound> F between o one and seven . okay . Maybe <disfmarker> <vocalsound> hold it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I think it's uh very uh very nice . I give it a <disfmarker> I give it a five . What do you think ? Yeah . So it's between one and seven ? Yeah . Seven is the highest uh ? <vocalsound> Seven is the <disfmarker> I will give a six . I will give a a five . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <gap> sorry . <vocalsound> And you ? <gap> eh ? Do you vote uh Christine ? Do you also vote ? <vocalsound> No , I just want to see something <disfmarker> Maybe we all have to agree on a common <disfmarker> Well , we can <gap> very easily <vocalsound> . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I think uh <gap> <vocalsound> and need to <gap> as well <vocalsound> . No problem . <vocalsound> Need to <disfmarker> So uh I don't know if you <disfmarker> we ha we have to put uh one uh f If it's better or <disfmarker> this is your <disfmarker> One is most <gap> . I <disfmarker> Uh-uh . Um . Well , we can choose what we want . Yeah . Okay , Or maybe we can say s let's say that seven is the best . seven is the best mm <vocalsound> . Okay . So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , Five . five . And what what's your choice ? Oh sorry . <vocalsound> Six <disfmarker> How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? Uh s you can <disfmarker> how much what ? How much would you <disfmarker> you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ? Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh <disfmarker> So it will have five point five average . Five point five average . Yeah . Wa can <gap> . <vocalsound> Okay . Mm . <vocalsound> Okay . Well , does it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I sorry . <vocalsound> Okay . So after , the technological aspect ? Okay , techne technological aspect . So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel . Yeah , we have the wheel . Uh . We also have the rubber material , which make it uh like new also . I think I would give a five . It's <gap> four . Four ? A four also , Yeah . because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . The rubber is <disfmarker> Okay . D are we including the voice <disfmarker> are you glu Uh a four . I I <disfmarker> are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? No . No . Okay . So No . what's your uh grade ? Four . Four ? So we have four , four f and five ? We can put four ? Yeah . For twenty five . Yeah , four . Four , yeah , let's put four . Everyone is okay or <disfmarker> four poin Four . Yeah . Okay . Doesn't it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ? Yeah . Yeah , I think so . Yeah . I give a seven , I think . Six . I would give a <disfmarker> I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use . Mm , six for me also . Six . So Six point five . <vocalsound> 'Kay . six point five . Six six six point five . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Is it fashion ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh yeah , its its f its fruit fruit shape . Seven ? <vocalsound> I would say seven . And is very very nice design . Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , and we say that the <disfmarker> Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . Yeah . Yeah , seven . yeah , seven . Yeah . Seven , okay . Yeah . Well , we hope . <vocalsound> Easy to find . <vocalsound> Uh easy to find in a room ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I lost my banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think you can't miss it . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah ? Okay . Uh . Yeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here . We have the lightning , or <disfmarker> Yeah , The lighting . we have <vocalsound> the <vocalsound> we don't sesh especially have the lightning <vocalsound> So you'll make the material transparent <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> so that it uh lights up completely , or <disfmarker> So it's yellow . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> It's okay . I think it's very easy to <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Seven ? I would say seven . <vocalsound> Six . It's hard to miss it . Yeah , okay . Yeah . Is it <disfmarker> is it robust ? Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , Uh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber . I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah the only problem there might be <disfmarker> which <gap> know , i if it's very sensitive , Yeah . they will , Yeah . I don't know <disfmarker> But it is uh <disfmarker> it is surrounded by rubber material . Yeah , okay . Yeah . So maybe we can put a six . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Everybody is okay , six . Six or five . Five <vocalsound> Six is okay ? Six , yeah , for me . Six . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . Yeah . S now <vocalsound> um so . Tadada . We have to sum up everything . Twenty . Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six <gap> . Thirty . Thir That's that's okay ? Six . <vocalsound> Six is a good <disfmarker> Okay . Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , Yeah , the top <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah , the be . and when uh s six sit six are good <disfmarker> it's a good uh p product , I think . Okay , so Mm . six is a <disfmarker> So will become eight soon ? So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising . Yeah , well it's a bit biased . <vocalsound> We have a good price Huh . and uh <vocalsound> . Yeah . Okay . Good . So this prototype is quite nice . <vocalsound> Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> uh quite big also , and they were selling <gap> something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . <vocalsound> Just a <vocalsound> just a phone , wireless . Mm-hmm . So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think . Yeah . I think the <disfmarker> But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not <disfmarker> cannot compare . Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . it's much more complex , but <disfmarker> So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . <vocalsound> The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . <vocalsound> So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . <vocalsound> Start to eat banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay so congratulation . <vocalsound> Congratulations to the team . Yeah . <vocalsound> Nice product . Uh very well , we worked together fantastically . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it was a good collaboration uh . <vocalsound> So Aspect . what does the management say ? Sorry ? What does the management say ? I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . Ah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> All it depends on who watch this meeting . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We don't know . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , so Okay . good guys <vocalsound> , <vocalsound> Okay . so see you for next uh successful project . <vocalsound> Yeah . Fruits . Mm 'kay . Mm .
I'll wait until you're all um hooked up . Oh good grief . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Okay . <gap> Oh . Put it on in that way . Oops . Thanks . Okay . Mm . Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . <vocalsound> After lunch . Yeah . Right um this is our conceptual design meeting , Mm-hmm . um <vocalsound> I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well . Mm-hmm . I th I I think <disfmarker> yeah um . Mm . This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . Etcetera . Mm-hmm . So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . Um the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um we have decided on a <disfmarker> leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um . You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries Yeah . and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , <gap> Yeah . things like that , um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range . 'Kay . Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ? Shall I ? Yep . Yes if you feel <disfmarker> Okay . We just connect up . <gap> Thank you . There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um <vocalsound> the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional <disfmarker> uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , sorry Project Manager <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's okay <vocalsound> . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . <vocalsound> Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that . 'Kay . Okay thank you very much . Um Yep . let's start from the inside and work our way out . Fine . It's okay with me . Yeah , okay . <gap> Unless anyone has any questions about that ? Not yet ? I don't think so , not yet . 'Kay . Um , yes , thank you . That screwed in ? <gap> Okay . I hate those little things Yeah . especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them . <vocalsound> I know . 'Kay , <gap> <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the <disfmarker> Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't <disfmarker> un unfortunately aren't available . 'Kay . <vocalsound> . Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we <disfmarker> I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , Wa <vocalsound> can you explain that ? people won't <disfmarker> it's it's basically like wind-up radio . Like a <disfmarker> right , okay . So you wind up your remote control before you use it . <vocalsound> How <vocalsound> <disfmarker> what kind of <disfmarker> It might <disfmarker> how l long can you get out of that , I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get <disfmarker> when when you got T_V_ . That doesn't count though does it ? Does does light charge as as sunlight does ? I thought it was U_V_ like <disfmarker> Artificial light ? No . Is it ? Alright i Has to be solar . Any , any <disfmarker> Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or <disfmarker> and dynamo might take more space . Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . Yeah , okay . Mm . Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights Artificial light , no . no , but I mean not many <disfmarker> you don't want to limit your market . That's going to <disfmarker> I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . I know , different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally . Uh <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Yeah and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway . Right . Night . Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway . Okay . The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches Yeah I've seen <disfmarker> and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . And are these like uh <disfmarker> what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? Um yeah it's <disfmarker> it charges into um some form of <disfmarker> it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , Mm-hmm . 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . Okay . And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out <gap> . But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time We c Yeah . so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time Yeah . If you'd <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . Mm-hmm . Yeah but then again Is it really gonna be enough ? I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um <vocalsound> it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . Okay . And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it Hmm . So it's not <disfmarker> the draw on it isn't <disfmarker> and you put it <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Mm . no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be <disfmarker> Okay . Could I just ask <disfmarker> referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? Mm . I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing or the two things not compatible ? Like a dual kind of . but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they <disfmarker> because , if you lie <gap> <disfmarker> on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . Mm . So that affects the exterior design . Solar would be slightly <gap> expensives . Expensive as well . They're they're expensive , What kind of price are we looking at for <disfmarker> they don't <disfmarker> I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? It's twelve point f Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the <disfmarker> It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping , 'cause if you drop stuff <disfmarker> Solar . yeah if you if you have y Well they're not designed <disfmarker> the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if <disfmarker> remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so . Y I think <disfmarker> Practical-wise okay . yeah , practically . I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot <vocalsound> whereas remotes you do , they can t You do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ? Yeah they do , they <disfmarker> yeah they've got dual things , but they're <disfmarker> the batteries are smaller I think . Mm . Mm . Another question is like <disfmarker> Again it de sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . Mm . A remote control , like , W m yeah so we have to s look at the life also . Mm . so the <disfmarker> Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd <disfmarker> I think the <disfmarker> it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in <disfmarker> or triple A_s would last . It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah . i <vocalsound> it's not gonna add anything , okay . Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ? Okay . Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing Yeah . and it's <disfmarker> Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally <disfmarker> Well add it in to think about um right , okay . because , where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape Yeah . and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of <disfmarker> we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much . Yeah . But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than Yeah . the eternal battle for control of the controls . <vocalsound> It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , No . it's not a thing that people are looking for Okay . when we threw it open to the field yeah . So <disfmarker> Okay . But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . Okay , right . Okay , well I'll move on . Mm-hmm . Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which <disfmarker> pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we <disfmarker> what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of <disfmarker> Well well this <disfmarker> the thi the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have <disfmarker> fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , Mm-hmm . if you if you wanted to Okay . but um the <disfmarker> there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit Okay . so that <disfmarker> And then to <disfmarker> uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was <disfmarker> 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . Okay . Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the <disfmarker> there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case <disfmarker> case housing Mm-hmm . and the the main problems with the <disfmarker> well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , Mm . and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , Mm . so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture Okay . and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ . Mm-hmm . I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's quite <vocalsound> um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more <disfmarker> they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not <disfmarker> because we'd have it in two separate units Second thing is <disfmarker> for the flip phone . Hinged , yeah . yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , Yeah . you call it a skin or whatever . So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . Mm . Yeah I th So is that feature available in like uh titanium , or it's like only specific to plastic or <disfmarker> Uh . Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , Mm-hmm . the ju just <disfmarker> it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . for a remote . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . Yeah , yeah . I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , Rubber , yeah . that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . And you can peel them off yeah . So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , Yeah . Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah . Yeah . Something like <disfmarker> like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . Yeah . Mm . Alright . That could be a good idea . Mm . Hmm . It could <disfmarker> Okay . it would be comfortable to hold on also . Mm . Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to . T Yeah . Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . Mm . Yeah . Also the <disfmarker> 'Kay . just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the <disfmarker> I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . Mm-hmm . Now what I was saying before about instead of having <disfmarker> you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over <disfmarker> if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen <disfmarker> 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they <disfmarker> you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of <disfmarker> display . Uh what what <disfmarker> Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like <disfmarker> Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could <disfmarker> becau you could fit it <disfmarker> Uh-huh . the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve <disfmarker> curved things with it , Okay . Mm-hmm . but um you can <disfmarker> you wouldn't have <disfmarker> with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . Mm . With <disfmarker> W also with the <disfmarker> I don't <disfmarker> s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh it would be flat inside . yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah . You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , Mm . Have I misunderstood you ? but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside . It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , Mm-hmm . but there'd be touch touch buttons , so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , 'Kay . w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . Mm-hmm . I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . Is rubber . Yeah . Mm . Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean <disfmarker> Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . <vocalsound> Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to <vocalsound> . Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out Like one of the palm pop thing . but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , Mm . Yeah . Absolutely , 'cause I had <disfmarker> f for somebody who <gap> very often , if he would <disfmarker> They're easy to replace as well , cheap . It would have to be attached . Hmm . a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a <gap> Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . Yeah . Mm . Yeah okay . Yeah just a thought <disfmarker> they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a <disfmarker> Okay , we'll talk about that <disfmarker> so if you finish your <disfmarker> and we'll come back to that . Yeah that's <disfmarker> yeah that <disfmarker> that's the end of m my <disfmarker> That's you , right okay . And just one small question before like you are <gap> , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons Yeah . like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . Uh yeah . Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate <disfmarker> you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . Mm-hmm . 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in . Mm . If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? No . And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display <disfmarker> th uh the remote control display thing . We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . Um . They don't look at themselves ? Just a thought . Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay . Yeah , no , no . <gap> trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much Mm . but <gap> maybe we'll leave that one on the side . Yeah . 'Kay . Okay . I mean you can <disfmarker> you could do it , you could have a <disfmarker> 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , Mm . but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , Oh I think <gap> forget about the mirror I'm not sure about <disfmarker> that was just a very quick passing thought yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Okay , okay . <vocalsound> Okay , uh would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety Mm . and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . Yeah . And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . Mm . No particular remote is standard . Like , some some people have a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Here you see this ? This is on a <disfmarker> I I I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . Okay . Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top Yeah . Sorry what does that stand for ? and g graphic user interface Which means <disfmarker> basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , Okay . Yeah . which is <disfmarker> If you if <disfmarker> yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen . Like you have on a l uh <disfmarker> icons or something y you have <disfmarker> is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface . Yeah . Okay . So basically <gap> not point or click <gap> <disfmarker> Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . Okay . And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . Mm-hmm . So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? <gap> 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . Yeah . No you'd hold it <disfmarker> you don't <disfmarker> if you flip it open then you'd be <disfmarker> Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li That's what I was just saying , and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top But <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . and then be able to touch that for the <vocalsound> other controls , Mm-hmm . Okay and you mean to the <disfmarker> so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , And the lower distance . on the lower side . Oh f perfect . Hmm . Okay . So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the <disfmarker> for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it <disfmarker> this at a low cost , but for <disfmarker> like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . Yeah . So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . Yeah . Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound Mm . and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh <disfmarker> you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also . Yeah . So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . My personal preferences would be like , as already <gap> uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh Mm . Yeah . tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh Well , yeah we <disfmarker> I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , Yeah . so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ? This is central one , the one you <disfmarker> Or is that volume and channel ? yeah volume and channel . So keep that m <disfmarker> that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . This and voice recognition . Okay . Right . Okay . Um I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . So , we agree on <disfmarker> Do we agree on the battery ? Kinetic ? The kinetic . Yeah . Yeah . Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having <disfmarker> Mm . so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . Yeah I think <disfmarker> I mean if <disfmarker> It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have selling point . and also if they've got it <disfmarker> if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , Mm-hmm . uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun . Mm . I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , Yeah . but I think pretty much we've used cheap <disfmarker> relatively cheap and simple things . Yeah . Mm . Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , The L_C_D_'s not cheap . Hmm . I mean they use them in calculators so . Yeah , okay . Maybe we could start with the black and white . Yeah . That that way we could upgrade later <gap> . And you could <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging , Okay . <vocalsound> Mm . we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? Mm . Well you cou um . Do you want like a back-up ? No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch <disfmarker> a battery that goes in a watch . I oh I see . Right , okay , got you . So it's a lot smaller , so it would <disfmarker> Got you on that okay , didn't realise . Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? Yeah . Yeah . So there's not a <disfmarker> really a decision to be made there , um . The buttons <disfmarker> what did you give us as our <disfmarker> The bare-board L_C_D_ or <disfmarker> Yeah the <disfmarker> well I think were <disfmarker> we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , <gap> on the on the on on the top one we're gonna On the top one okay you've got the touch <disfmarker> yeah . okay and then <disfmarker> On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones . <vocalsound> Okay , okay . Sorry could you repeat that last part ? Um , okay on <disfmarker> we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . L_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . Okay . And for the <disfmarker> sorry . No , it's fine . For the body design I think plastic , Plastic , uh w yeah okay . we could use the body , For the inside . for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , <gap> so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , Plast right . <vocalsound> Oh I think so , I think so . okay . and it is just uh <disfmarker> although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , Mm no . No just go for the colours . I think I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway Okay . um the fact <disfmarker> the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , Mm-hmm . but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know <disfmarker> The feel . yes . So we could just pick anything . 'Kay . Mm-hmm . Is that going to be <disfmarker> this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , is that fancy <gap> ? It's just different Uh I <disfmarker> it's different . it's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses , Mm . sort of beige and black Mm-hmm . um so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . or you want something that contrasts as <vocalsound> Mm . you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . Mm . This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more <disfmarker> And you would just have an <disfmarker> across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little <disfmarker> Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming <disfmarker> I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , <vocalsound> Mm . And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes <vocalsound> Right . which is another beauty of it . y you know , you could just go so far with it , You can you can just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . Yeah . like a puffer fish , <vocalsound> you could just , you could take it wherever , so I think that's quite a flexible thing . Yeah . And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case <disfmarker> casing <disfmarker> the case outside , Yes . it should be moulded <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> with <disfmarker> the design in such a way you can change it every time . Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . Mm . Okay . The rubber . Yeah . Okay we've got five minutes , <vocalsound> um , or that might've been up for a while . Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah , Fine . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um <vocalsound> L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also Mm . Mm-hmm . because that <disfmarker> we are not <gap> for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost . So , are we looking at voice <gap> ? Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains . is that right ? For l yeah , the whistle . Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah . So we can <disfmarker> if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . And incorporating the company logo ? Yep . Have you <disfmarker> Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design . Mm . 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product Okay . don't they ? Well they do , but I think we can <disfmarker> you could <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours . well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising . Yeah . Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is Yeah . Okay . and that does the work for you . Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently Okay . but I think it does , without that so I'm not worried about that . Okay . Did we <disfmarker> I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? Depending on how i <vocalsound> Yeah , depending on the expense of it . I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so And they've got in stock , so yeah . um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards . Yeah . Right I'm going to wrap it up there . Okay . <vocalsound> Fine . I got a end meeting now message on my mo <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Did it ? yeah Yeah . <vocalsound> so . Um Again a questionnaire huh ? so I think we've probably got <disfmarker> it says , closing we have forty minutes You got to go through . so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back . <vocalsound> It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took <gap> . I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now . <vocalsound> Is everyone happy ? <vocalsound> Okay .
Okay . So I see all everybody's here , 'kay . Mm-hmm . Yep . And we can start meeting . Okay <vocalsound> . What's the agenda for this meeting ? The <disfmarker> I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you . Okay . Um as you can see here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Perfect . So first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting Mm-hmm . and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but <vocalsound> then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh Mm-hmm . Next . Um . So y you are the secretary also . Yes . Indeed . Right ? Okay . Then I hope you all have uh worked out <vocalsound> some some uh <vocalsound> some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh . <gap> Um . W We will uh in a minute we will uh <vocalsound> start with them . Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . Uh Um about the functions Mm-hmm . and <disfmarker> Well in this meeting we should really <vocalsound> try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the <disfmarker> Mm . You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this , Mm . <gap> Oh the customers , okay . the customers , indeed yes . Yeah . Think that's that's important matter . That's the big question yeah . Uh . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . Good . Um . Maybe um why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? No , I don't . You don't have presentation ? I wasn't . No . Uh you want a table to to uh I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um . Mm-hmm . Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . Um . It's <disfmarker> probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it . Um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Um . Mm-hmm . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . Mm . Um . Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ? I have an a web page yes . Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . Uh about this . Yep . Yep , sure . Mm-hmm . So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um <vocalsound> and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Mm . Um . Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . Um . Mm . An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , Yes yes , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . Um . I have <vocalsound> that too <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . Mm . Um . It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's <disfmarker> Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . Yep . Okay too much time to learn . Okay . Um . And thirty <disfmarker> twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Not enough <gap> I don't know how we'd go about combating that . <gap> . What do you mean there ? For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury . Okay . Mm . So . But <disfmarker> They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? Mm . <vocalsound> But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ? Yeah . That's what the report says yeah . So mm . Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the <disfmarker> on <disfmarker> Uh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . You can disconnect it there <vocalsound> You can maybe just just <disfmarker> no ? Ah it's <vocalsound> it Oh no , yeah . okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file Yeah . okay . O otherwise you yeah . You can connect this one . Um , s hang on . <gap> Then you can connect this one or this one yeah . <vocalsound> All to your computer . Yeah . Well . So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um <disfmarker> Oh yeah . <gap> Oh I need to muck around with this . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . Hmm . It's just a web link . Yeah <gap> Okay . Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design . Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the <disfmarker> hang on a minute . Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yep . Um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control . Speech recognition in <disfmarker> And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . D do you have numbers o o on that ? Ah okay . Yes , I'll just get this up . So that we don't <disfmarker> Do we not need any button on the remote control <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well potentially yeah , um <disfmarker> it would be all based on speech . Okay . I think even for interesti Interesting idea . yeah I think that would not work so well . You wanna have both options . Okay . Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost , I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my <disfmarker> well it's <disfmarker> we should be in range , Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm . or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . Yeah . But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for <vocalsound> for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents <vocalsound> . Well it would be f Yeah . Yeah . No you can't . And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? Oh . Well , <vocalsound> it depends you know like there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , Mm . But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting . Mm . yeah . Yeah . It's it's going to be li Yes , that that that that's mm . it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case Do you have some more important facts but it's <disfmarker> but I don't know with twenty fi Okay . or can we go to the next presentation ? Um <disfmarker> So you had to to to summarise maybe the <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . Mm . Okay it's uh decline . Okay . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Decline with age , mm . But we sh Yeah , <vocalsound> it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um , Mm . <vocalsound> Mm . which we'll be talking about later I think . Yes . We will talk about it later . <vocalsound> Did you get the email ? Okay . <vocalsound> Yep , Mm-hmm . that one . Just follow that link . <gap> I thi <vocalsound> You us It'll be in a different window , yep . yeah yeah . That's <disfmarker> left <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that one . Yep . Okay perfect . .. . Mm . So that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics . Okay . Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that . Mm . Okay . <vocalsound> um Mm 'kay . Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ? Yeah . Mm I okay I stay <disfmarker> Oh , this is <disfmarker> Now you can move I think yeah . <vocalsound> I can move as far as <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh . Maybe I take your chair ? I Yes . You can you can sa take my chair . okay <vocalsound> . It's a channel selection , a module <gap> , this and this function , Sorry ? go to the <gap> . Oh . Yeah . So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer . And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um <vocalsound> is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important . Mm . <vocalsound> So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . Mm-hmm . And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit Mm-hmm . and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright . So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first <vocalsound> the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . Mm . Mm-hmm . So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna Mm-hmm . and um w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want <vocalsound> . Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh <disfmarker> it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh <gap> the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , Mm . right . So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's <disfmarker> my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . This is <vocalsound> very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that . Mm-hmm . And um so what I have found and <vocalsound> after a lot of work actually I <vocalsound> I draw this I draw for you this uh schema <vocalsound> Well . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know . You drew it a long time ago ? Is huh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that Ninety one . <vocalsound> overwhelming <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components . No . <vocalsound> And and why do you want these kind of component ? So . So I mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? What were your <disfmarker> found and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive , Mm . but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components Yes . It it it's more clear now I think . but maybe yeah <disfmarker> So <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma No no no no we we will uh <disfmarker> This is a preference but we can always change uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . Of course yeah . So we we must adapt to the to the receiver . I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh . Yeah . We will use uh <vocalsound> infrared protocol uh using <vocalsound> yeah infrared and uh and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists Mm-hmm . and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting <vocalsound> the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . Yes . Okay . Um . Okay . <gap> Thank you . Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies . The frequencies ? Yeah yeah . Of course yeah Yeah . in the chip you have it <vocalsound> But you should be careful , yeah . people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s <vocalsound> , so basically <gap> through all the things . That can control o other things . Yeah . Mm . Ah . So maybe we should think of <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Of course yeah we should take that into account Yeah yes That's handy . yeah . I I I <disfmarker> So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . in the uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ <vocalsound> and you can just walk away <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all <vocalsound> . Yeah . I I feel I I I like that idea . I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things . <vocalsound> Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew . Yeah so <vocalsound> . I I I assume you were finished here . Yes . Uh okay . Okay . <vocalsound> So I can take I think mine now there . Okay . Okay so voila . <vocalsound> Hmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm . Okay . Oh . I <disfmarker> Uh , sorry ? I know where it is . It's on the desktop . It's uh <disfmarker> Technical function . Yes . Okay . It's uh <disfmarker> Like so . <vocalsound> Well . So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , Mm-hmm . Yep . so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that uh basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ Mm-hmm . and uh <vocalsound> um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver . So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later . But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys Mm-hmm . and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . Mm . Yep . <vocalsound> And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option . And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but <vocalsound> tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . Then there is uh <vocalsound> this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch <vocalsound> . And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those Mm-hmm . so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market . And then <disfmarker> whi which is generally used by the people . And then <vocalsound> well personal preferences I would <disfmarker> uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the <disfmarker> we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote <disfmarker> video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with <disfmarker> Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , <vocalsound> so you <disfmarker> on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ Yeah . and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , Yeah . so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? or does it know which one you want to use ? Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing Mm-hmm . but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option Mm-hmm . and you could play it or <disfmarker> You can also think about having like um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you Mm-hmm . suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you Mm-hmm . Mm . and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program . Mm . In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities <vocalsound> . Mm . Mm mm mm mm mm . Mm . These are kind of next generation <vocalsound> functionalities . It's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years . Mm yes , Mm . but I think it's i i it's already there , It's goi I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop . Yeah it's <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm 'kay . So it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . Mm . Yeah . That's fair enough . Mm . But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . No no we are not making a universal remote , That's , yeah . we are just looking at uh giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box Mm . which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me . Mm . Because y W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . Mm-hmm . Mean , you can go <vocalsound> pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects Mm . Mm . Yep . yes . Yeah . So <vocalsound> But it's good to keep in mind . Mm . Okay so that p ends my presentation . Mm . Very well . Well . So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently <vocalsound> booming up actually Mm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And it basically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you Yeah . Mm . and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . And thi this is going to come . Good . Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . Yeah . Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie Yeah . Mm . and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah so . Um , so u um Yeah . I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you . Um Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's that's especially because of the internet of course . Hmm . So we should think about it um . Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . Mm . Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . Um Mm . Um . further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh , or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ? <vocalsound> Uh indeed indeed . So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? Mm . And and and the hard disk recorders . Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh <vocalsound> y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which Mm-hmm . well Fourteen <disfmarker> Forty . or for O okay . So <disfmarker> So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older <disfmarker> older and you'll al <vocalsound> always need to have the the future with younger people . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Um therefore , <vocalsound> younger people like trendy <disfmarker> trendy designs , so that's w we should make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . Hmm . Mm . Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , Mm-hmm . but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys Mm . you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually <gap> Mm-hmm . so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh <disfmarker> Mm . Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh <disfmarker> Mm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , Yeah so . Yeah . Hmm . Yes yes Because they are already used to that , you know , product . mo that's the the the mm the new and the funky things , Yes Yeah . that's , it's recognisable <gap> yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . Mm mm . That's <disfmarker> And and they are skilled uh by using it . Mm . So for example uh <disfmarker> Well uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . .. . Okay , it works . Fine . So , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that Mael can you hand me over this uh ? Yes . <gap> Uh thank you . Mm-hmm . Okay . How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? Mm well I think fi five min 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all Forty minutes ? and it's a very important issue . Yeah so Mm-hmm . you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so . <vocalsound> too sorry , so we basically don't change the uh original order of them <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but then the keys are more spacious , Mm-hmm . they don't look uh <disfmarker> so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six , Mm . Mm . so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered Mm-hmm . but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys Mm . but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to Okay . 'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear . Yep . Yeah . Mm . Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . Yeah . Which I think is quite tricky . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control <vocalsound> <disfmarker> wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? <vocalsound> Of course they have already one . So our our our remote control has to be better . But it's not going to have more functionality , Mm-hmm . 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might <disfmarker> we'll be able to <vocalsound> beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , Mm-hmm . they have to actually need it as well . So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . Mm . I <disfmarker> well I think <vocalsound> many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one Mm . Yeah . but <disfmarker> But why are they buying one in the first place ? Indeed . So that will be about functionality <disfmarker> Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm . In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance <disfmarker> Well , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , What do <disfmarker> What do you think about <disfmarker> we're not building a high end product . Yeah What componen we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ Mm . and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps Mm-hmm . and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . Mm . Yeah . And um <disfmarker> But yeah But <disfmarker> yeah . If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that that's <disfmarker> which would drive the cost up a lot . I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary . Ye Is the L_C_D_ screen <disfmarker> I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary <disfmarker> well , th for long term . For universal remotes <disfmarker> If you <disfmarker> mm . I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive . And quite complicated to use , S so we can try to go in between , yes . and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated Mm-hmm . Not as flexible maybe , Yeah . yeah , but s but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh R_C_ yeah . <vocalsound> Universal . because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . Okay . So they're <disfmarker> People <disfmarker> yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control . yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yep . I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know . Uh well Mm . <vocalsound> I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . <vocalsound> Mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So d Do you agree ? Well <disfmarker> Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive . <vocalsound> Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million Uh and it d uh <disfmarker> Our provin so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is <vocalsound> uh price of a chip is very cheap . Mm . Mm . <vocalsound> So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less <vocalsound> yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah . Mm-hmm . You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ? Yeah . Okay . Um so then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control . Uh yeah , that's that's what we needed basically . Mm-hmm . Mm . Mm . Okay . Uh that's needed right now . And uh basically you can look to the standards of other <disfmarker> Yeah that's needed , yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . And if we want to get the market , we really need that . Yeah . Yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . Actu Yes . Exactly . <vocalsound> Yeah . And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . Is that okay for you ? Yeah . Mm mm mm mm . Yeah . Yeah . So given we are going for this uh uh universal type uh m <vocalsound> maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content Yes . Mm . Okay . Okay . and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market . Mm-hmm yep . Voila <vocalsound> . Hmm . So So . anyone uh has a point to bring in Well . or shall we <disfmarker> Oh I don't have anything right now . no . We can we'll we'll go Oh that's that's fine then . Okay . and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good Mm-hmm . W for the <vocalsound> yes , Yeah . we uh we can have lunch now . Mm-hmm . So um Yeah so we meet in <disfmarker> well <vocalsound> what are our <disfmarker> Then th th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . But you will be informed via the computer . Okay . Okay . Cool . <vocalsound> Okay <vocalsound> perfect . So see you later .
So we are here to talk about functional design . Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from <vocalsound> <disfmarker> than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . So here's an agenda . Uh I'll open . Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . <vocalsound> Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> now <vocalsound> you can all give your presentations . We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . <vocalsound> Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . Uh did you all receive that email ? Yep . Yeah . So does anyone have any overall <gap> Well <vocalsound> uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having <vocalsound> no teletext , people are very comfortable <vocalsound> with <vocalsound> the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not <disfmarker> we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . Mm . Mm . Yep . So that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack . Mm . And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than <disfmarker> Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet <disfmarker> <vocalsound> there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess . <vocalsound> Right . Yeah . No , I I agree with you . So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side Okay . which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that <vocalsound> identifies our product as better than <disfmarker> because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . So that's that's that was my reactions . Okay . Yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . Yeah yeah . So we're quite fixed . Yep . So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . <vocalsound> Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote , Okay . Yeah . we not design the T_V_ . Hmm . So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we <disfmarker> people use our remote with . Yeah . 'Kay . That's right . Hmm . I think we take with you . So it's kind of a stupid decision . But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . Right . For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement <disfmarker> wants it as <vocalsound> cheap as possible . Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess . That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took <disfmarker> they can't ac access their teletext . Mm . Okay . 'Cause we're talking about <vocalsound> eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . K yeah . So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? What are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to d <disfmarker> in my opinion we have to double up . Mm 'kay . <vocalsound> If we lose one we need to bring two or three . Okay . Okay I think that the <vocalsound> last point is probably quite uh straightforward . Obviously the the <disfmarker> w it has to be branded . So then the double R_ will be our our <disfmarker> 'Kay . On the product yeah . I think one of <disfmarker> Can you handle that black and yellow ? I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry . I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this <disfmarker> I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . So I think our kind of <disfmarker> our target here is to <vocalsound> have some kind of very like sleek <vocalsound> nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . You know we don't wanna a big clunker . Mm . We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so <disfmarker> So you have this ? Nah . So we have three presentations , and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . That's <disfmarker> Yes . <gap> Okay . That's fine . Okay so Mm it's enough . But uh click it on off ? so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em . <vocalsound> We need some kinda of power d power source . Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which <disfmarker> and it receives that signal . You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there . And uh we also need to um have the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . So <vocalsound> those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around . Now is <disfmarker> would this be <vocalsound> considered just a standard uh um <disfmarker> I think any des This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . We're talking about existing technology . No . Right I think <disfmarker> Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . Yeah this is just <disfmarker> this is just a basic layout of ev <vocalsound> of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that <vocalsound> I mean <vocalsound> that you can kinda say would <vocalsound> would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . Okay . Okay . Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . 'Kay . So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h <vocalsound> you know how much power . Mm 'kay . Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? No . Uh I don't have any figures right now . 'Kay . We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . Yeah . N okay . Um but <disfmarker> and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think . Mm . Mm the shell ? Yeah . Basically yeah . Okay . Okay . So yeah . That's all I have really . Okay . Thanks . And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro . <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> I can give you that to click on . Hey mouse . <vocalsound> Open . <vocalsound> And you wanna get <disfmarker> When we're fighting over it's also more <disfmarker> lot more fun . <vocalsound> View a slide show , that's what you wanna do , yeah ? Just go up to view . Uh . Click , don't <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm 'kay This doesn't work . <vocalsound> So yeah function design . Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . Um something cute and small . The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . <vocalsound> And um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh <disfmarker> that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the <disfmarker> to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their <disfmarker> the stations . There's no need to have that in the remote . So um um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but <vocalsound> um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the <disfmarker> But I t I think what the <vocalsound> the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . Mm-hmm . Because otherwise we're just going to <disfmarker> I mean <vocalsound> even if it's necessary or not , if you <disfmarker> if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really <disfmarker> if it i <vocalsound> if it isn't more expensive for us to k make <disfmarker> because as far as I understand it , <vocalsound> it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? Right as far as <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . So it should be in there . i it's just uh <vocalsound> the cost of an extra button . I mean software-wise there's really no difference . Yeah . Okay . Isn't <disfmarker> I think . <vocalsound> I have maybe a silly question . I <disfmarker> in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the <disfmarker> it's gonna be out-moded teletext . I I don't understand how those two things are connected . How does how does computers and teletext <disfmarker> h how <disfmarker> why is one eliminating the need of the other ? I don't understand that . Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . So that might play on what we can do . Yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that <vocalsound> you would use <disfmarker> you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that Scheduling . Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know . and now <disfmarker> Yeah Okay . and now you can c look it over Internet . But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . I think I ha Yeah 'cause , yeah , I agree . I just <disfmarker> I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the <disfmarker> the remote is is used for television , okay . Yeah , but it's not happen yet . Yeah . Well for me <disfmarker> Well you have digital T_V_ still already . So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . S Yeah . Unless you have a <disfmarker> Yeah . Well there there is a <disfmarker> for example on digital T_V_ systems you have <disfmarker> you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . Mm-hmm . A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can <disfmarker> Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , Okay . but you still use it through a teletext . So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . Okay . Yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . That's the thing . And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and <disfmarker> <gap> I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . I don't think . Mm . But still there there's an opportunity . If if it's <vocalsound> , for example , a trainable one then we're <vocalsound> just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so <disfmarker> <gap> Mm . Okay . Well I dunno . One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs . I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . Just you know <disfmarker> Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . Yeah . I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , Yeah . I just I I <disfmarker> Yeah , and neither do I in fact . but I'm not a tech-mind either . I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and Bu uh . <disfmarker> 'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay . <vocalsound> I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . Yeah . Right it's just not We are selling it to an existing market . <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Um but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . Yeah I dunno I'm <disfmarker> but we're not putting some <disfmarker> there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . That's <disfmarker> Yeah , and and , Mm 'kay . yeah , That's the problem . and and we're also <vocalsound> marketing a product . It's <disfmarker> what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing Mm . Yeah . because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . So if we drop <disfmarker> if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? Hmm . So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ? Yeah . I don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . I need to make it special with a high price tag . I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . Mm-hmm . I want I want to market it as exclusive . So I would market this product it <disfmarker> at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really <vocalsound> beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility . But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden <disfmarker> stan standard T_V_ so the place <disfmarker> uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant <vocalsound> high-priced basic remote . Does that make sense , huh ? No I no I I understand what you say , Mm . but what I'm what I'm , okay <disfmarker> we probably need to move along , Yeah we probably should . but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , We we're doing alright for time . and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ? Yeah . So that's just my question , but we can keep talking . Okay . Sorry that kinda cut into you there . No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um <disfmarker> Right . I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people <vocalsound> how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do <vocalsound> to use all these functions . Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna <disfmarker> you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . They want something that looks nice , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . Mm . I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . Is that <disfmarker> I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . <vocalsound> Yeah . Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh <disfmarker> for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think <vocalsound> you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ? Maybe five percent , you know , Yeah mm . Mm . But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . and how much <disfmarker> Right . Yeah okay . Be a good idea . I'm sorry . Uh sorry , I didn't mean to cut in <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Sorry boss <vocalsound> . I'm not the boss <vocalsound> . Okay . Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . <vocalsound> You know sell uh <disfmarker> things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh <vocalsound> um voice-activated . I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but <disfmarker> I think that's probably a question more for Is that for over here ? for this guy here , yeah . Yeah . Okay , alright . Well it's kinda both of us . Us us user interface . Is it ? That's <disfmarker> Okay . 'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated Mm-hmm . I think of of <vocalsound> how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something Mm-hmm . I was thinking about that . Then your lights would go off , though . <vocalsound> Mm . uh and and so so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But this 's just something . I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? What makes this thing attractive ? And it's only for televisions . So we <disfmarker> everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their <vocalsound> their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only . And so to me we have to make this a really special product Yeah . I I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . At this price I don't see it yet . I'm <disfmarker> I I go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but I I don't see the market niche for this product without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . Hmm . But we th that should be design . Yeah . That should be the design basically . Right . I think technology we'd we <disfmarker> we're not in the price range to do it . We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design . Okay . Have to do <disfmarker> you have to do it in the box ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay well , so so that's up to you then to <vocalsound> to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary . <vocalsound> Okay . Maybe make it in the form of a gun . We can sell it in United States . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I have a question uh for you . Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? In terms of making it work or the cost of that or <disfmarker> I don't <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I think all these things are pretty standard . I think we'll be okay . Okay . 'Kay . Cheers . Onto participant <vocalsound> four . Well <vocalsound> you know for marketing f <vocalsound> marketing for me is uh <disfmarker> <gap> <vocalsound> and uh how do I go here ? Okay . Mm you can just click . Go go . Is that right ? No no no you just get off that . You just click anywhere . Ah-ha . Yeah , what for me is it um <disfmarker> I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . I just know that I I was identified as a a <disfmarker> we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . Mm-hmm . That's what we decided here . Um so what I did is I I decided that <vocalsound> that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . Mm-hmm . Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together , um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some <disfmarker> I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . I don't know . These are just thoughts . Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . So to me it's about selling d uh our identity <disfmarker> our corporate identity along with the product . <vocalsound> Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive . Mm-hmm . Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for <disfmarker> I I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . If if we could have a technological something <disfmarker> I have an idea . Mm p please . And it's kind of <vocalsound> along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . Mm . Um what we can do is , well you know that batteries <disfmarker> throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . Right ? <vocalsound> Solar . <vocalsound> Yeah . And <vocalsound> s for some people <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Well maybe not a solar remote But solar <disfmarker> but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . You never have to get <disfmarker> go through the <disfmarker> go through <vocalsound> uh all these different batteries . And also you can <disfmarker> I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design <disfmarker> or for <disfmarker> not just for the user design , but also for the <disfmarker> just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , <vocalsound> a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . <vocalsound> Blah , I like it . I like the idea , but we're talking about <disfmarker> in cost is gonna probably double . It w it would increase the cost . But boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . And you could page the remote if you lose it . Maybe there's a button on the cradle . Yep , that's right . I really see Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? But the cost i No no . No no , we have t we have to change the end cost . There's uh <disfmarker> I mean I don't see it anyway . We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh <vocalsound> Can we dl can we do that without <vocalsound> uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? Yeah , that's gonna be up to these guys . I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> my reaction is no , but Well <vocalsound> what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs Mm-hmm . and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be <disfmarker> Well , see I I <disfmarker> see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls . I <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> Every home's got to have it . If you don't have one , hey what kind of remote do you have ? Oh you've got one of those , oh fantastic , I want one of those too . Yeah . I just don't have enough money right now . I just don't know about that , because in order to do that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um <disfmarker> Nah , I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . <vocalsound> But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . <vocalsound> Yep , one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay . Mm-hmm . Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . They say they say okay here you go . They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , Mm-hmm . and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . Mm-hmm . I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . I don't know what kind of role we have in this <disfmarker> in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your <disfmarker> here's our ideas , okay . Mm . And then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , but <vocalsound> to me it's it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? beca I I do not <disfmarker> I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . Mm . I don't see it . I don I I d I have to disagree though . I think our market niche is basically people who need <vocalsound> <disfmarker> who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . It does what they need . These aren't <disfmarker> I I think that it <disfmarker> And and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh uh <vocalsound> for cutting in but , I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 'cause it's selling on its own . Right . It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or or whatever . Right . Right . No I understand that . So technologically , if I understand it , uh T_V_s <vocalsound> T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code . <gap> So saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things . Mm-hmm . Nope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . Yeah y y you you wouldn't <disfmarker> They've identified this product limita Oh okay okay . We have done this . That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . The interface will be different . If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , I see . Mm-hmm . but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , Right . Well here's <disfmarker> And I I'd <disfmarker> because who wants just a television remote ? Mm sorry . Right . I don't . <vocalsound> We he well here's my thing about that . If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . If it can't control <disfmarker> if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just <disfmarker> you can throw all your other remotes away . I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote . That's right . <vocalsound> I I I have a tendency to agree with you . I really do . So we really can't chase that . That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . I really question where we create the demand . So I think what we <disfmarker> So that's what I'm saying <disfmarker> We're really looking for something basic . The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . We're selling more than just the product . We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . We want people to eventually say , oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . It's reliable . <vocalsound> And and we're gonna make it <disfmarker> we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , <vocalsound> and solid . So if we can make <disfmarker> if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely <vocalsound> big thing . Mm-hmm . I think that's big . W <vocalsound> okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make <disfmarker> go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . Good design . We only have a few minutes left . But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ? <vocalsound> Yeah for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . Okay . I think so , yeah . In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . Okay . And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . So to me <vocalsound> , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I don't know what that is . It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features . Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . Yeah . If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand . Yep we have five minutes left . Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions . Or my d <vocalsound> And I can communicate this to to the more senior <vocalsound> uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . What about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? <vocalsound> How do you feel about that ? Or how does everybody feel ? Well how does everybody feel ? <vocalsound> I mean I I <vocalsound> well we g we're talking about the other end now . <gap> I I think <disfmarker> I like it . I like the idea , No , but I <disfmarker> that's the thing I I don't think it's necessarily the other end . but we have t we have to find out <disfmarker> The other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would I wanna buy that ? And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . It <disfmarker> i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , Right . and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . So it's very good for some people but it's not a like <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well it lasts <disfmarker> it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . Yeah well it <disfmarker> You have to l sort of remember . You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well . <vocalsound> I d I d I d I think it it <disfmarker> in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact . Mm . But I I don't know , that's just my opinion . Well , I think again it's it <disfmarker> we have a cost issue here . You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . Are we gonna make this <disfmarker> selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? Mm . <vocalsound> Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . I don't see it yet . 'Kay . <vocalsound> So what do we think maybe we should <disfmarker> Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ? Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good . W <vocalsound> a question I have in in a <vocalsound> <disfmarker> 'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . Really need to wrap up now . Can can can we have multiple designs ? Have a modern , have a traditional , have a <disfmarker> you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . I don't know what that creates cost , or <disfmarker> Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yep one over another . Yeah , okay , I hear that . Yeah , complicated but <disfmarker> Um but what we could do is some kind of <vocalsound> well I mean <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel <vocalsound> <disfmarker> it has to feel good in your hand , Yeah . it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . Even though the cost may be low . Yeah . What ab what ab <disfmarker> what about a a remote that's <vocalsound> that <vocalsound> doesn't maybe look like a remote ? Just an idea . Mm-hmm . Just just okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . They're selling these things everywhere . Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone . Or what if it looks like a pen ? Doesn't matter , yeah . Yeah . I'm just jus I talking about some <disfmarker> something to make this thing unique . A pointer ? It <disfmarker> That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on . Yeah . I'll sell whatever you guys design . Mm . Yeah . I don't have a problem selling a product , that's not the issue . I give you ideas , you guys create the product . Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . Don't worry about it . I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . Okay . So just <vocalsound> to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . Um I really <vocalsound> <disfmarker> un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like <disfmarker> for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that . I mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that that worked uh , this hasn't been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch . A lot of people <disfmarker> No no . As a watch ? Yeah , there is remote control watches um , Mm 'kay . but I think they're a sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it <disfmarker> Yeah they are not simple . uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know . Mm-hmm . One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's what I was saying . We gotta stop ? <vocalsound> Gotta cut up . Who's lost or broken their their remote . So <vocalsound> how many remotes do they wanna buy ? Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? Exactly . Mm . Yeah . And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . How does this happen ? The last remote you'll ever buy . And also presumably they've <disfmarker> And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . Well if if we're going down that then we can <disfmarker> we don't need to go the <disfmarker> Exactly . it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make . Yeah . Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all True . because that's just done with mobile phones Right . you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there . Yeah . The locator'll definitely be more expensive . Mm-hmm . Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet . We really need to finish up here . But uh <disfmarker> <gap> uh <disfmarker> we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . <vocalsound> Yeah we have the <gap> the power-adaptor products . We sell power-adaptor products . So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology . It's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting . Yeah . <vocalsound> So we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about . <vocalsound> Yeah I think so , A charging system . without it being too <disfmarker> In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here . Right . If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . Right . I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . Okay . Yep . You know , something like that . 'Kay . Thanks guys . Yep . No that's not what I want , I want <disfmarker> Oh look it here .
Is that alright now ? <vocalsound> Okay . Sorry ? Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . Could you plug me in ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Thanks . All ready to go ? Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Um so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the <disfmarker> The first one <vocalsound> is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , 'Kay . so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the <disfmarker> of the remote control . Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . Okay . So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um <vocalsound> uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say <disfmarker> 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . Uh something <disfmarker> Yeah , Mm yeah . I mean do they <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . So that's something we can discuss as well . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . Um so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ? Nope , we're all set . Right um , time for presentations then . Who would like to go first ? <vocalsound> I'll go first . Sure . Okay , cool . Alright um , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? Uh <disfmarker> Oh yeah , of course , yeah . G go on ahead . <vocalsound> <gap> so this is the technical functions design . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Right <gap> to do the um <vocalsound> the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . Mm-hmm . Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um <vocalsound> your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Right . Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . <vocalsound> Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , um <gap> sh show you now . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> here um the button there and there . <vocalsound> Alright <gap> . This one's prog . Sorry . That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . Um it's a very simple one . It's got only the basic functions mm but um <vocalsound> it's the same size as the the hard to use one . Oop . <vocalsound> Uh it looked a bit clunky . They're very big and not very much use for <gap> buttons . <vocalsound> Um , <vocalsound> and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . Um it's very easy to use . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . <vocalsound> Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha <gap> from the bottom of it . So , <vocalsound> now I'd like to ask for your preferences . Um not sure of how long we've got , uh <disfmarker> Um . Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . Mm-hmm . Just a couple of minutes anyway . M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . Mm-hmm . But anyway , um we might come to that later . Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . <vocalsound> Um , the clunky one is the one on the right . Okay . Yeah . Um clunky in what sense , like um h heavier ? Larger ? Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . It's , you know , it's very spread out I see , so it's more just basic . Looks kind of <disfmarker> Yeah . and kind of <disfmarker> you know Right , okay . , I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> got very few buttons on it and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Sure . Well I think it's a valid point . I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , Mm-hmm . so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , <vocalsound> I think that's a good idea . Mm-hmm . I think it's a good idea . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um , <vocalsound> do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . Mm-hmm . Uh-huh . Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . Uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . Okay . Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? Which was that ? Would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um <disfmarker> Up <disfmarker> the numbers , or the up down ? God , I wou I would say that's required , <vocalsound> I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , Yeah . I mean would anybody disagree with that ? Yeah . Um , what else , uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So don't need to worry about teletext , <vocalsound> don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , We don't ? No ? you know like brightness and contrast ? Yeah . Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? Mm . Is that right ? Is that what we're we're doing ? Yeah . Um , yeah . We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? Um <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have Mm-hmm . um and after that we can add things if they're possible . Okay , right . Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . Yeah . Yep . Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and <disfmarker> There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . Right okay . Um <disfmarker> Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . Mm-hmm yeah . Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Oka Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , Mm-hmm . things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available <vocalsound> and then others that are concealed . Something like that . Okay . Uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section <disfmarker> Have I just lost <disfmarker> Oh no . Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . Yeah . Any of <disfmarker> you anything to add to that at all ? No . No . I'll add it later , I guess <gap> the presentation . Okay , right . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um okay , <vocalsound> if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um Sure . <vocalsound> Do you want to switch places ? Do you wanna <disfmarker> Can this can this pl reach ? Can this plug come across ? No . No . Probably not , actually . No . <gap> So why don't I just pick up and move then . Yeah . Here , I'll just <vocalsound> Why don't I just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm er , can you go up behind me ? Just just switch them . Kinda <disfmarker> This is so <disfmarker> This <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> bit complicated . It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? I'm all in a knot now . <vocalsound> Okay . Right . <vocalsound> Um . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh <vocalsound> the things . Oh , like overlap between what you said ? Yeah , yeah . Oh well , for all you know that <disfmarker> that'll happen . Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been <disfmarker> Mm hard to know what <disfmarker> where your role ends , yeah . So how do I how do I get this up ? Okay . Um function F_ eight . Uh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah . Okay . Okay . Alright . So <disfmarker> F_ eight ? Function , the blue button . Next to the control on the left . Oh , and F_ eight . Okay . Yeah . Mm . You have to push it together . Mm-hmm . Yep . Okay , I think that that's doing it now . Nope . Try that again . Uh , again ? Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose . Wait . Okay . Yeah , you wanna <disfmarker> Um , Oh oh here we go . Yep , there we go . <vocalsound> okay great . There you go . Okay . Just um <disfmarker> Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's <disfmarker> now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so . <gap> Increase that 'cause we can't see the <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . That's much better . Right . Can you um <disfmarker> There you go . Right , okay . Okay . Alright . That would be <disfmarker> Okay . So um does that make sense ? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could <disfmarker> and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . Uh to think about trends and also about <disfmarker> try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Bouncing on top . <vocalsound> Dunno . Okay . Um . Yeah . So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um <vocalsound> the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . Mm-hmm . Okay I'm gonna <disfmarker> we'll look at that in a second . Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't <disfmarker> doesn't really appeal to them . Mm-hmm . So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like <disfmarker> if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . Um , <vocalsound> frustrations . They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . Um , takes time to learn how to use them . This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . Um and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . Repetitive strain injury . Is installing a new remote control something that people <disfmarker> Uh , no , that did not come up at all . Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um . <vocalsound> And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be <disfmarker> wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . Mm-hmm . Um people <vocalsound> uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . Okay . So want something that looks good and is easy to use , Yeah . big priorities . Yeah , Okay . so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . Mm . So it <disfmarker> you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's <disfmarker> I think it's a good idea . Yeah . That's s that's sort of the um <disfmarker> But I <disfmarker> I'm <disfmarker> my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . Mm-hmm . Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , Okay . although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . Mm-hmm . But not let that confine us technologically . Okay . Right . So Alright ? Any um comments on all of that ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um <disfmarker> who's our our target audience , our target market . That's uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? Okay . I mean <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Where's the money , maybe . Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . Yeah . Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , And who watches T_V_ . Mm-hmm . well I don't <disfmarker> I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . Mm . But you want <disfmarker> it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , Mm-hmm . they're gonna actually go out and buy one . Yeah . So , who do you think we're aiming this at ? Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? <vocalsound> It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . Is that too <disfmarker> is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? Yeah , Mm-hmm . okay . Right . Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . Okay . Kind of . You know how much ? I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? Okay . Like a simple replacement , right . Yeah . I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , Yeah , Yeah . yeah . This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . would you <disfmarker> how much would you pay ? These are the age groups which we have information on Yeah . and these are <disfmarker> this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . <vocalsound> Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . Okay Okay . Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? Yep . Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Um <disfmarker> Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? What what do you think , Craig ? Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? Sort of the the older group . Uh , yeah , it's the <disfmarker> Yep . Uh f It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , N yeah . in terms of <disfmarker> I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want Okay . and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . Yeah . Sure . Sure . Yeah . So um anybody <disfmarker> anything there to add <disfmarker> Just kind of young professionals , uh th like <vocalsound> if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . Mm-hmm . So we could say that was our target . I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . Yeah . Yeah . You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . Mm-hmm . I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , Mm-hmm . who are familiar with their <disfmarker> with computers in in their everyday work . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I think people who are maybe about <disfmarker> I wouldn't say thirty five , Mm-hmm . but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Yeah , sure . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So these are people who are gadgety , right ? People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , Yeah . when you go on to their working lives , Yeah . people who would you know regular So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . That that's that's a good point . Um okay , so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition If we can . if we can . I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , Yeah . Yeah . Okay . because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . Why is that ? You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . Right . Okay . Could it be an on off thing ? Um , Like if you want it on <disfmarker> Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . Yeah . Okay . Sure . Sure . So maybe we should <disfmarker> Okay . I suggest that we think about speech recognition , Yeah . Sure . <vocalsound> anyway it's a <disfmarker> it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . Uh-huh . Yeah . Okay . Sure . Yep . Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentation Okay , sure . and then then we can <disfmarker> I don't know <disfmarker> Yep . um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , Yeah , it's good <disfmarker> but this is this is how we're <disfmarker> well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . Yeah , exactly , yeah . Um <disfmarker> Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . Not <disfmarker> Yeah . Um . And not losing . And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , you know they <disfmarker> they're saying oh it's <disfmarker> I lose it in the couch . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <gap> like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together Mm-hmm . that they <disfmarker> I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . <vocalsound> Really ? Right . Channel up . Oh really , you've seen one before . <vocalsound> Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . Sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad . Mm . Course not . Thanks . Cool , There you go . um . Okay . Um . Right . Well this is just the working design um . Mm-hmm . Well this is just what <disfmarker> how I would go about it . Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . Right . We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're <disfmarker> we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like <disfmarker> Besides the basics , I think back <disfmarker> in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . Mm-hmm . Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? Um and I just <disfmarker> the idea is just to get everybody to um <disfmarker> I usually <vocalsound> have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that <disfmarker> to start everything going . But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think um there's a need for that . Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . It just explains how the process goes through , Mm-hmm . from a <disfmarker> from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . Um okay , you need some power source . 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . Mm-hmm . Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . Uh-huh . Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . Mm-hmm . Like for example , voice recognition , right . That might be constrained because that <disfmarker> you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . Um <vocalsound> Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . Hmm . You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic <disfmarker> a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . It's fairly general , um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , Mm-hmm . like um voice recognition , right , um , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . So it's not really a constraint in that sense , Okay . Mm-hmm . but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , Mm-hmm . what the technology has to do . Okay . Okay . Mm-hmm . Um so I guess the rest of it <disfmarker> I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? 'Kay . Uh . Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? Sure . Sure . Yeah , w I'm done . Are you are you all done ? More or less . Yeah . Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . Yep . Mm . Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , Okay . you know , stuff like that . Okay . Right . Um <disfmarker> Right . And like on the <disfmarker> means <disfmarker> b I guess this would be <disfmarker> Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like <disfmarker> what are our options ? Yep . Alright , what's what i in <disfmarker> Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . Right . This is just um The basic principle of <disfmarker> a basic principles and basic components that are needed . Okay . 'Kay . Right . Mm-hmm . For example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , <vocalsound> Okay . Mm-hmm . which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that . Oh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . Okay . Uh Yep . Yep . Okay . So each component represents one function , Mm-hmm . but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , Mm-hmm . and the power are things that you won't have to care about . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . Mm-hmm . Okay . Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? Okay . Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right . Okay . Right . Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it Yep . um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha There might be one other problem with the transmission , um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . Mm-hmm <vocalsound> Oh , yeah . I it <disfmarker> Right . you may not require that , but you know , um it's it's Right . it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , Yeah , mm-hmm . <vocalsound> and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . Okay . Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . Mm . Mm . Yeah . Okay . So in that sense , there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . Right . Okay . Not so much further down . Okay . And um just a clarification before we finish this . Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? There's there's not much specific specific information , W but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . Yeah . Okay . Because infra-red is something which everybody has . W Well well we've um <disfmarker> In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , <vocalsound> Just to T_V_ , okay . so that's what we should do for now I think . Okay . Something I was wondering about was the power . Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? There's a there's <disfmarker> Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , Uh-huh . and you add cost to it , Uh-huh . um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay . Or you need to get the user to plug it in . <vocalsound> Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . Okay , so <disfmarker> Yeah . But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , Yeah . then I don't think rechargeable is something we should <disfmarker> you know , we really need to care about . Yeah . Okay , so just stick to to regular <disfmarker> Um . Okay . Um , right . So basically the um <disfmarker> I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , <vocalsound> and what exactly the product's gonna do . Okay . Okay . So um just to recap on <disfmarker> Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? Yeah , that's good . Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ? Um . <vocalsound> I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . Okay , right . Ta . And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? Um I think we include mute , but apart from that um I think we just <disfmarker> we'll go for the simpleness . Okay . Okay . Okay , I think R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under <disfmarker> like sort of under a door or some <disfmarker> Yeah , it's as optional functions . Yeah . 'Cause what what I'm <disfmarker> I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . I dunno if that'd be a problem . Okay . <vocalsound> Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? Mm-hmm . Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . Yeah . Okay . One would be audio controls , Mm-hmm . one would be video controls , Okay . and the other one would be a device . Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , Yeah . but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , Mm-hmm . um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . Yeah . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , Right . <vocalsound> like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , Yeah . and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . 'Kay , okay . Like that . I mean it might help with the visualisation . Okay . And it would actually help with the component build as well . Mm-hmm . Okay , right . Mm okay , great . Um , okay well I gotta kind of <disfmarker> got five minutes to wrap up now . Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . Whoohoo . Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . Mm-hmm . Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next <disfmarker> well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , Mm-hmm . um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . <vocalsound> Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . So um I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . <vocalsound> Um , do you wanna start with David . Anything else to say at all ? Mm no , not really . No , okay . Um yeah , <vocalsound> Andrew ? just <disfmarker> I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea . Uh-huh . Shall we do that , then ? Mm . Yeah . Okay , great . Um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ? Um things like on off . Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . Yeah . I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , you know , um so um <disfmarker> Okay . And and channel . Um <disfmarker> And channel . Right . Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . Not on off video . Yeah . Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound , Okay . say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . Okay . Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . Okay , We put it out . so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume <disfmarker> hi Mm-hmm . Yeah , anything to do with what you hear , right . Okay . Mm-hmm . You you put that into audio . Okay , Mm-hmm . And then video is anything that you can see . and then visual <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , Um . Yep . Colour , yeah . and then just actual device things , Yep . like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , Sure . Sure . Yep . Okay . stuff like that . Okay , um <disfmarker> And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more <disfmarker> Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Sure , okay . Okay . Yeah . Okay . Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . It's easy to use , I think that's one thing that um <disfmarker> and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well Okay . 'cause things are like fixed . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , <vocalsound> because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . Mm-hmm . Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , Mm-hmm . you know , things like that . Um , <vocalsound> so I guess I guess that's it . Great . That's the meeting over . Whoohoo . Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
That should hopefully do the trick , um . 'Kay . Sorry about the small delay . Falling a little bit behind schedule . And that's uh fifteen twenty five . Okay . So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? Uh The new black , I believe . <gap> . Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course . Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . Okay . So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype . Okay , it's a <disfmarker> Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure , <vocalsound> <gap> I think if we both step up but <disfmarker> and uh outline our ideas . Okay . Now do <disfmarker> uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh <disfmarker> Okay . <gap> ju just a thought . You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . But as you as you see with the uh <vocalsound> with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain <gap> ergonomic design . Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down . I'm afraid yeah . Yeah . We'll go into that a bit more , but please go on . <gap> this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . <vocalsound> So . Any further comments ? Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , won't it ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . 'Cause it <disfmarker> you can't get it curved . Uh because of costs . Yeah , I mean the uh <disfmarker> Yeah . And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand . Mm . Yeah . I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand . One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have <gap> the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh <vocalsound> of the rigid substructure . So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely . <vocalsound> Mm . Lovely . Um . Yeah , <gap> . <vocalsound> Okay , yeah . Great . Um . Right . Yeah I've got a <disfmarker> if you load up my evaluation document . Yeah , okay <gap> . Okay . Excellent work . Mm . Um . Uh evaluation . <vocalsound> Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . <vocalsound> Um then we will <disfmarker> it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . So um not seven steps , seven scale . So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . And uh the criteria <gap> based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . 'Kay . Um if you flip the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So , those are the criteria . And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means <vocalsound> that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Put it mildly . So we have um true ? One , t Seven , eight , oh . Fourth . Okay , so we have to go through each point . If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score . So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . I mean , uh is the homing thing still <disfmarker> the locator , is that still <disfmarker> Yeah , that's still part of the design . Sure . And Adam , we can keep that in ? Yeah , I believe so . So Okay . I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , <vocalsound> Sure . but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have . T Mm . Sure . Mm . And making it a bright colour helps with the <disfmarker> personally I would have gone for purple <gap> . Mm . Bright colour . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we still have that noise thing , yeah ? Mm-hmm . Os on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding <gap> finding it once it's lost ? I'd say number one . Number one ? One . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Number number one for the first criteria . I think w if it was just the sounder then th <gap> I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is <disfmarker> What about <disfmarker> what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume <gap> can't find remote . Bu Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Um Yeah . Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker <gap> . Mm-hmm . just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is You wanna say something ? um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright . That's fine . Yeah , is that <disfmarker> Oh that's that's fine . Um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this . What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna <disfmarker> I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? Um , a few . <vocalsound> Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . So they say we put the fashion in electronics , well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion , so . Okay . That's this bit right here . And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . And we can come back to it , you said . So . Okay . No and which we will do very very shortly . Um . Okay . Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , <gap> require more buttons , etcetera . Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . So we're just managing it really . Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um . Different languages ? That should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . <vocalsound> We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . Um . We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person . Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h <vocalsound> is have it um circular and have it s <vocalsound> so that the uh the pink <gap> actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm . Okay . Mm . So that uh th It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . Um . Mm . Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ? Um b b b da is <disfmarker> you mean on the plastic , or ? <gap> . Let's have a look . You now have as much information as I do . <vocalsound> Um . Yeah , yeah . So as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one . We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick . Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? That's quite significantly expensive . I <disfmarker> that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . Um <vocalsound> <gap> . Mm . <gap> yeah . as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price . Yeah . So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . We don't even have uh speakers here . The <disfmarker> like uh we uh <disfmarker> what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ? Mm . Uh no , we haven't , not <disfmarker> Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ . <vocalsound> Is that gonna be a button , or <disfmarker> That'll <gap> it literally would just be a button . Yeah . That's too expensive <gap> We might have to <disfmarker> isn't it ? It looks like almost nothing <disfmarker> Mm . Oh good call , I missed that . I I mean it's not on here , but um . <gap> that's a very valid point . Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ? Yeah . Okay . Well that's <disfmarker> yeah . So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display , then that's <disfmarker> What's a hand dyna dynamo ? You have to wind it up ? I believe so , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such , <vocalsound> Technology . Yeah . Fashion . yeah . Okay . So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now . Being manipulated by the joystick , yeah . Oh , and joystick , yeah . Which I'm defining as scroll wheel . Um . And we couldn't replace the joystick , right ? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a <disfmarker> but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ? Mm . Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation . So <disfmarker> The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves the remote . a fair amount . Which you could <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But that's what makes it uh original though , isn't it ? Mm . I think <gap> if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings Yeah . <vocalsound> and we just <gap> we could just put our branding on any other remote control . Yeah . Yeah . Um . Uh k It's a shame . We should possibly have <disfmarker> If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . Does this does this bear in mind that <disfmarker> I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components , you know . Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . Mm . Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm <disfmarker> we're gonna have to stick with these figures . 'Kay . So , I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , <vocalsound> I think so . despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ? Mm-hmm . Um yeah <gap> I mean one thing , I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean <vocalsound> keep the um the articulation ? It's hard to tell . Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , This is what I'm wondering . and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation . Yeah . Oh no , I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved . It can be s yeah , it can still be single curved , but <disfmarker> It's uh it's just <vocalsound> it's just <vocalsound> it's just that the case would come in t <vocalsound> would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation . You just <gap> . Single curved with articulation ? Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'Cause like we <disfmarker> do we have re restrictions on software ? That's what we need for the joystick I think though . Oh but there has to be <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah , I mean and <vocalsound> I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . Um I mean <gap> <vocalsound> But the curves all o over <gap> hand , yeah , on the <gap> on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it is it ? could just as easily be done um without curves . The curve that's really needed is up here , <gap> joystick . to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand . Okay . Sure . Okay , my bad . We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . Mm . Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal . So I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria . Which is what we can get onto now . As long as <disfmarker> so are we gonna say <disfmarker> <gap> w we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we're gonna say um single curved design <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Oh , wait a minute . Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ? Is that somewhat similar to what we want ? It could well be , Mm no but at a cost of <disfmarker> that's that voice response thing that we got the email about . Costs four . Yeah . But I thought it was just completely pointless . You got a email about voice response ? Yeah . I did not , so . Alright . B i basically it was <gap> saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice <gap> . <vocalsound> Okay , yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one . We won't go with that one , did you say ? I mean I <disfmarker> we <disfmarker> Yeah , that's voice recognition , so . Okay , okay . Um . So , okay yeah , battery definitely , <disfmarker> So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca <vocalsound> locator thing . It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , um . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Maybe even slight Mm-hmm . well oh yeah , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . So we'll leave that one for now . <gap> we'll just have <disfmarker> Are we going for a special colour at all ? It's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure . One <disfmarker> point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . Um . Mm . Well I was <gap> for a case . At which point if <disfmarker> Or had you already incorporated that ? Oh , special colour for the case . Well you got point five there . It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . I'm not quite sure if they're <disfmarker> I don't think they mean point five Euros per button . Mm-hmm . Okay , well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case So and then we at least have <disfmarker> make it a little harder to lose . There we go . Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room . W what's the default colour ? White or black ? Black's probably the normal colour you'd say , Or grey . yeah . Right . I quite like that colour that you're fetching there , Yellow . <vocalsound> it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better . Yeah . <vocalsound> So will we go with that then ? Okay . Yeah . It's not and we can see <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sure . we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> So uh <vocalsound> Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time . We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , Right okay . Okay . but . Think it's ten minutes left . <vocalsound> Ten . 'Kay . Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . Um . Okay . Special colour . Special colour . Mm mm four ? Uh uh four . Three ? Mm . Three if we're being generous , I feel . Three . I think we can do three . <vocalsound> Three . <vocalsound> Th the special colour doesn't <disfmarker> would I think make a difference . Think we're being generous here with three . It makes it stand out from <disfmarker> you know it's lost in a big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap . <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Reduce the number of unused buttons . We're down to t two buttons , is it ? Two buttons . Two buttons and a joystick . Okay , so that's a one . You know , where that's <disfmarker> Totally . Yeah . I'd say we're doing well there . Okay , that was good . Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus <gap> that's yeah <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . that's good . <vocalsound> 'Kay that's <disfmarker> we're not doing so badly . Um <vocalsound> easy to use <disfmarker> oh okay , let's forget that one . Fancy looking . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> As he models the <disfmarker> It doesn't get much fancier . Sure . And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_ . Yeah let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display . <vocalsound> Maybe I was panicking for no reason . Are we going one on <gap> ? <vocalsound> Yeah , I'd say we go two , 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved . Wouldn't it ? I'd <disfmarker> Mm . w maybe you'd be a bit too <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> yeah . There we go . Yeah , With the articulators . With bells on it . that's m that's that's better too . More accurate numbers . Technologically innovative . Well , we're getting rid of the locator thing which which Which is a shame . yeah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Mm . I'd give it a three for this <disfmarker> for that . No need for teletext . <gap> . Yeah . I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , 'Kay . but <vocalsound> you see it in a lot of other places . Yeah , mobile phones . Mm . And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , so it's <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . You say three ? I might go as far as two on that . Three . I'd give it a three . I'd be tempted with three , yeah . Three . Okay . Okay . We'll get panned on the next one , anyway . <vocalsound> Materials that people find pleasing . Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently . Yeah , w It is , yeah . Don't blame them . <vocalsound> Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . Yeah . Plastic , it sucks . But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . That's true . It's not a step backwards . <gap> five ? Mm-hmm . I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest . Six ? Six , <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah , okay let's give it a six . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , that's totally thrown everything off balance . Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . W we could . What colour were we gonna make it ? Put a leopard print on it . <vocalsound> Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours . <vocalsound> I know , Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype but <disfmarker> 'cause we had yellow . If I were buying one , I'd go for purple . Leopard print would be cool . But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg , <disfmarker> Yeah we gotta <gap> . I'd say the colour of the border there world <disfmarker> you'd find that , <gap> that's that'd stand out . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like yellow , yeah . It would also help keep the the product placement Logo , brand . s yeah . Mm . Mm 'kay . But <disfmarker> Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing . Is it inspired by <gap> clothing fashion ? Is this like a banana type colour ? <vocalsound> Yes . Could we stretch <disfmarker> no still , it's not shaped like a banana is <disfmarker> It's kind o it That's kinda <disfmarker> <gap> i probably <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it won't be when it's been Oh is that 'cause it's flat ? budgeted . What is <disfmarker> what fruit or veg is flat ? I I think s I I think this isn't <disfmarker> not particularly fruit and veggie . Um . Yeah . Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . <vocalsound> Yellow courgette . <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , <vocalsound> what , four ? Four ? Oh that's it's very ambitious , Is that being too generous ? Mm . I'd <vocalsound> I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . <vocalsound> Is the sole criterion for being um fashion <gap> fashionable or inspired by current fashions . yeah , um . Oh dear , <gap> . Sure . Inspired by <gap> . Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually . Well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like . Yeah . And we're we're not doing well on it . This is their strategy . I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . Might <disfmarker> we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one . What would you think yourself ? I would say <disfmarker> I mean it's it's not at all , right ? <vocalsound> In any way or shape or form . <vocalsound> Well , We didn't m it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like . Okay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay . Si it's got a curve to it . Right five . Is that <vocalsound> sound reasonable ? Am I <disfmarker> Yeah , I'll go with five . do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ? Five . <vocalsound> Yeah . 'Kay , so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . Which gives us an average of three . It's <disfmarker> well this would be in the middle . So we it's it's not bad . It's in the good section . It's not bad and considering the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> don't pick the pen . Um . <vocalsound> Oops . Sorry . <vocalsound> I'm I'm sorry . <vocalsound> Y oh and you've knocked batteries out . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um right okay 'S bad design , that thing . <vocalsound> it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive <disfmarker> you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly , based on um the the cost features . Mm , yeah . Mm . Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do <disfmarker> I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so I think we're definitely on the good bit . <vocalsound> Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . You know , it's <disfmarker> Mm . Personally , I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control yeah , we did it w it was okay . It was good . that you've already got , are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ? Well , it depends who your <disfmarker> who's <disfmarker> what the target people are , like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious Maybe it's been targeted <disfmarker> women would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . it's yellow , looks like a banana , it's cool it's gotta <disfmarker> look good in the sitting room . Hide it in the fruit basket . Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology <gap> it's good , it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick . So , which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ? Probably the people technologically . They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think so . I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she's had it for a long time , you know . She uses it to make phone calls and that's it . <gap> . Yeah . So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , you know . Mm-hmm . She'd be like is this a remote control , I don't <disfmarker> how do you use it , and stuff like that . So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time . Mm-hmm . I s <vocalsound> I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative , um for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons , Um . Yeah . yeah . Yeah . But like radical good , maybe . Okay . Um don't know how lo much longer we've got . At least five minutes I think . Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . Um . So , we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? For example um <disfmarker> we'll work backwards I suppose . The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . Um <gap> people made good use of the uh pen and paper ? I would say <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Wrote nearly a page , Yeah , got notes and doodles . Yeah . but not <gap> . I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . I think tracking . Well I think this is a <disfmarker> I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh of the researchers studying this . It's all p goes into their corpus . Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um It must <disfmarker> transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves . Yeah , that woulda been pretty good . It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . So maybe this is literally just a way around it . Um I dunno . How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? Good . <gap> . I'd <disfmarker> yeah I liked it , yeah . Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing . Very good . I li yeah , top marks . Um last one we've got is room for creativity . <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> Now , <vocalsound> Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , I think we got <disfmarker> <gap> squish . We're burs bursting with creativity . yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah We we're not lacking in ideas , you know it's <disfmarker> that was not the problem . I think of <disfmarker> in the end , ideas that can be used <gap> sadly <gap> . Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . Mm-hmm . It's a bit of a pity . Um I would have to agree on that . I think we needed a larger budget . Yeah . If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is . Because they will pay outrageous cash to <gap> Yeah . Mm . I mean I th <vocalsound> I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh first on the market . in added expense . Mm . And the price was like <disfmarker> it was twice the w assembly cost . And would it have to be twice that ? It could be like coulda had the assembly <gap> like maybe fifteen Euro . It could even <disfmarker> We'll still settle for twenty five <vocalsound> . That's true , yeah . Maybe . <vocalsound> Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess . As to a <gap> the costs involved . But I mean we've got a a prototype . Such as it is . <vocalsound> So I dunno , I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such . Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more <disfmarker> Yeah , to begin with . In the beginning , yeah . Yeah . Probably would have <disfmarker> mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end , Yeah . I would have to agree . It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . Always hard to tell until you know the costs . Um . Okay . Are the costs within budget ? <vocalsound> Well , they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product . Okay . We've evaluated it , and we can say that we came out with a value of three . Yeah . Actually I want th <vocalsound> one thing I would say <disfmarker> I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over <gap> going over-budget um m would make to sales . It's <disfmarker> yeah ? And like response from consumers <gap> . And we could even you know , market two versions . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . <vocalsound> And then the final one where you get to call it Hal . <vocalsound> Sure . But we'll go into that later . Yes . <vocalsound> Right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um <gap> anything they think that's not been covered , before I quickly write up a final report . Um I dunno , I mean we've got a product . We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . Yeah . There is a huge market . I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such . And I can get my bus . Yeah ? Okay . Yeah . Okay , let's <disfmarker> Uh thank you for your participation . Thank you . Thank you . <vocalsound> I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . It's like man , we we can't have the locator thing . And s yeah that's just bad . Do you think maybe <gap> the prices were were made ? That <gap> a question we can ask <gap> . <vocalsound>
Okay . Everybody found his place again ? Yeah ? Yes . That's nice . Okay so this is our second meeting . And uh still failing ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh now we're going um into the functional design . Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . So that we can move onto the second uh phase . But first this phase . Um first an announcement . There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> There's our <vocalsound> ghost mouse again . That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this uh <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . It's in wing C_ and E_ . So it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . But it's going to be cold anyway , so <vocalsound> I don't think you're gonna need it . <vocalsound> No . Then our agenda . Now first the opening . Uh this time I will take the minutes . Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me . And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . So we've got forty minutes for all of it . So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . Yes . Um who wants to be first ? Think I'll go first . Okay . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Just maybe it's easier if you um <disfmarker> Yeah I think you will tell <gap> your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about . <vocalsound> 'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So <disfmarker> Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So Mm . some things . Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Then these are the <disfmarker> This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . Um <disfmarker> Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So <disfmarker> Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . Um <disfmarker> The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . And the functionality <disfmarker> As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily . Um <disfmarker> Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . Okay . That would be all . Thank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ? Any questions ? Mm-hmm . About functional requirements ? No . Okay that's clear . <gap> Now to the second . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh okay . Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah you can take your time . Okay . We've got uh plenty of time , Mm ? Yeah you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . so <disfmarker> Oh . <gap> Uh . Oh yeah . Yeah . There it is . Yeah . Okay . Um yeah . I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and <gap> not much information about it , <gap> <disfmarker> Um about uh interface but uh <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . So um <disfmarker> But uh it must be uh user-friendly . So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh uh uh <disfmarker> Yeah . In one um remote control . One remote . But um <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> Um yeah . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . Um few uh buttons <vocalsound> but uh <disfmarker> This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um <disfmarker> Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um <disfmarker> My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . So um <disfmarker> Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um <disfmarker> Uh this the remote control uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh <vocalsound> I dunno um <disfmarker> And um here you've got a s kind of a display . It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh <gap> . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or <vocalsound> <disfmarker> So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . So uh Hmm . <vocalsound> that's uh my uh idea about it . 'Kay . Um yeah and <disfmarker> Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So a touchscreen . Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . Everybody uh have to use it so <disfmarker> Uh ol even even old people um young people . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . So uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Uh yeah . That was uh my uh part of it . Okay . So <disfmarker> Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . <gap> N I I don't think so . Yeah . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . Touchscreen . Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah . Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh <vocalsound> for uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh . Huh . So it's possible . Hmm . 'Kay . That's nice . Uh <disfmarker> Well it would certainly make a fancy design . Yeah . Yeah . But the <disfmarker> It wouldn't be very robust . So <disfmarker> It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it . That is true . That's right . Yeah that's true . We would have to look into that . Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? Uh <disfmarker> And then we <gap> have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design . Uh . Yeah . That's <gap> . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think it's going to <disfmarker> Uh it's not too much . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . That's it . Okay . Thank you . Okay . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up <vocalsound> and uh tell you some new uh requirements . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because <vocalsound> uh it will be too complex Okay . and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . Mm . So it has to be simple . Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control . <vocalsound> Um internet is also mentioned <gap> in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . Yeah . So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? <vocalsound> Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . <vocalsound> But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . Yeah . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . I'm pretty much against it . Against the no teletext ? Mm . Yes . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . But I mean if I s if I see this , it's <disfmarker> I think we're just gonna go for another <gap> forty <disfmarker> Yeah it's it is <disfmarker> Standard remote . pretty No I think we can and not innovative I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons remote control . which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . Yeah . And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market . No . And besides that , they're not very critical so <disfmarker> I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . <vocalsound> But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think <gap> <disfmarker> the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . So let's try it . No . I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control . Yeah . People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them . Mm . Yeah . I think that if we're <disfmarker> If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um <disfmarker> I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? So <disfmarker> Yeah . It's a big success . Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . I haven't heard of it . Very big success . Yeah . Hmm . Uh . I think so as well . Mm . We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just change our focus on the project , and I think we can uh we can sell this . Uh I simply think um <gap> uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . <vocalsound> 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . Mm . Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Um <disfmarker> But obviously the board tends to disagree . No we we haven't voted yet , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem . Or is teletext a <disfmarker> But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . Yeah . Yeah , also . So it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . So I suggest uh <disfmarker> I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . It's <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . Is anybody um really against teletext ? No . No ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext . I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . Yeah yeah . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . Uh that's a good idea . Yeah . Yeah . Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um <disfmarker> Functionality should be few buttons , you said . Yes . I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So to keep it simple . But I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause <disfmarker> Well might be . If it's only for televi But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . Yeah . Yeah . You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , No . Yeah . volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but <disfmarker> Yeah . But do you need <disfmarker> I think if you if you only l So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it . But do you need the buttons for one to zero . Nah . Maybe c we can <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that . Maybe we can use uh <disfmarker> 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . Yeah . Yeah . No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? Or a joystick like ? Mm . There are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . That's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that . Yeah . Mm . And besides that it's um <disfmarker> If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons . That's right . So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . Mm-hmm . Mm . <gap> the numbers yeah . Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . But I think there won't be very much buttons . Yeah . Or there don't have to be a lot . But I don't think <disfmarker> I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area . The number of buttons ? Hmm . Yeah . I think it's very important in the in the design . You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with <disfmarker> That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ . To operate only the T_V_ yeah . 'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either . No . No . So . So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . 'Kay . So we can <disfmarker> That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition Yeah . That's right . which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot . Yeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . <vocalsound> Uh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons . Maybe . Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and <disfmarker> But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . 'Cause it can be <disfmarker> No . And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible No . yeah . Yeah . No . Because I think that's uh <disfmarker> That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station Yes . or very <disfmarker> <gap> Hmm . That's a nice requirement . Docking station . <vocalsound> So we're just gonna focus on the extras ? I think so . Yeah . Mm . Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a Yeah . like to have extra in a new remote control . That's a good point . Um <disfmarker> You said they easily get lost as well . Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . Yeah . So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . Yeah that was what I suggested . Yeah . Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . You have it on <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah Hm . you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . Yeah . And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . Yeah . So So you know where it is . audio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive . No . <gap> Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , Y i because <disfmarker> um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause Yeah . it's uh <disfmarker> Mm . It will be too much as well . <gap> I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does . Yeah . And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , Based . Okay . Yeah . but <disfmarker> Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen . Just a small screen That's a good idea . with two <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Some extra info . Feedback . Yeah . Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well . Yeah . But I dunno if that would As the small screen . that would fit into the costs . Extra button info . I think that should be possible as well . Um <vocalsound> let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions <disfmarker> Yeah . 'Kay . And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . <vocalsound> So that doesn't really matter . No . Mm . So I think we nee I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . Uh what do we want ? I think <disfmarker> If we want um a <gap> with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can target the real elderly people . I think that would be a <disfmarker> If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company . Yeah . And I think , I think there would be a good market for it . So that's the <disfmarker> If we're able to really bring an innovative product . <gap> Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . Yeah the really <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . But I'd have to look into that a little more . Sixty . Okay . And different cultures . Are we <disfmarker> Well I don't think they have different television sets uh Mm . Okay . in uh every country . No . No . 'Cause <disfmarker> We've got five minutes left <vocalsound> just now . So 'Kay . 'Kay . Small warning . And with uh the little screen in it , <gap> which explains the buttons . You could <disfmarker> I think we n it would be a lot easier to Should <disfmarker> adapt it to different cultures . Yeah . In different languages , you know . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . or you have to put a language button in it , Right . but that will be a bit unnecessary I think . No . Yeah . Yeah . It's better to put it on different markets with it all . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . So that's the the target . Uh then a few small things . <vocalsound> Uh okay . I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . <vocalsound> Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , <vocalsound> uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . 'Kay . So um I thank you for this meeting . And I think we have a lunch-break now . That's good . Yeah . So that's a good thing . <vocalsound>
Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the <disfmarker> in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's <disfmarker> the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's <disfmarker> we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . <vocalsound> Right . Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ? <vocalsound> Okay . Let me <disfmarker> we've got forty minutes . Right s <vocalsound> so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , <vocalsound> You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay . yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . Mm-hmm . Um mm , <vocalsound> Let's hope the pen holds out . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> okay , so basically I'll start off by <disfmarker> uh <vocalsound> I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require Mm-hmm . and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to <disfmarker> connect that anyway <disfmarker> brief introduction to the insides of a remote control Yeah . and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is <disfmarker> so <vocalsound> this is the outside of the remote , right ? Mm-hmm . If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . Mm-hmm . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , uh <vocalsound> everything else is kind of <disfmarker> Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ Yeah . and uh on pressing this button I <disfmarker> a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . <vocalsound> So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , Mm-hmm . so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Mm-hmm . Right ? So that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ? Mm-hmm . So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our <disfmarker> uh the cells , yeah ? Yeah . Uh thes these are the kind <disfmarker> different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um <vocalsound> Does that mean like a wind-up one ? yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> A wind-up remote . So uh I don't know if <disfmarker> even if you want to consider this , <vocalsound> but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll <disfmarker> Okay . since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . Mm-hmm . So <vocalsound> the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones . You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . Yeah . And charging their remote , Yeah , yeah . and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's a good option . <vocalsound> So what was what was this k ka The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . Okay . Uh yeah . But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you <disfmarker> Yeah . But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also <vocalsound> made by the company . Yay . <vocalsound> Environment friendly . Okay <vocalsound> um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . Yeah <vocalsound> . There are different cases that can be provided . They can be <disfmarker> basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , Mm-hmm . they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with <disfmarker> on both the sides . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> These are the three options , right ? Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , Yeah , mm-hmm . would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Did you say wool ? Wo wo wood . Wood , wood . <vocalsound> Wood . Oh right . Yeah . <vocalsound> Not wool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A fluffy remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta <vocalsound> . Oh really ? <vocalsound> Okay . Huh . Um the <disfmarker> so uh we can use even um <vocalsound> a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh <vocalsound> uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . Mm . For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . Mm-hmm . Yeah ? Uh okay , the interface options now . So <vocalsound> we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh <disfmarker> Sony . Mm-hmm . Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it . Yeah , yeah , something like that . Mm . <vocalsound> So , and they have <disfmarker> they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . Okay . The scroll plus push . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um <vocalsound> in the last decade , so not too recent . And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> The various electronic options are um uh <vocalsound> so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh <disfmarker> so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one Mm-hmm . or a regular or advanced . And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . Mm-hmm . Um the <disfmarker> we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . Right ? Um <vocalsound> and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is <vocalsound> <disfmarker> did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . Mm-hmm . So , these are the different options that we have . Okay , so <vocalsound> th that's that's basically <disfmarker> now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um <vocalsound> uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , Yeah . <vocalsound> keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah . Mm-hmm . Excellent . Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah . you can sit down , but just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we might need you to leap up . <vocalsound> Okay . What are you , PowerPoint , or <disfmarker> Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah . Right . Okay . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? 'Kay . Some sort of radiation ? <vocalsound> No it's got its little camera in there , Yeah . <vocalsound> plug it in <gap> . Okay . 'S a Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah . Right , interface concept . Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the <disfmarker> this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . That's fine . So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I <vocalsound> I can just mention them aw again . Mm-hmm . Okay . So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which <disfmarker> uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . Mm-hmm . Um um the method I <vocalsound> employed this time was <vocalsound> a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and <vocalsound> also um <vocalsound> whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um <vocalsound> and then um <vocalsound> this uh this um <vocalsound> this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . Mm-hmm . So some findings um <vocalsound> um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um <vocalsound> okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> sorry for that . 'S go back . <vocalsound> That's nice one . Ah , no , please . Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually <vocalsound> of the <disfmarker> of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least <disfmarker> uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . Ugly . Mm . <vocalsound> Um okay . So let's carry on with this . Um <disfmarker> So uh um o other findings <disfmarker> um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . <vocalsound> Our own company has developed a new in user interface <disfmarker> uh wait , no this is not the one . Okay , there is a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows <disfmarker> i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . Mm-hmm . Mm . Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display . It's <disfmarker> yeah . Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed <vocalsound> a new um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh programmable speech uh <vocalsound> mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's <disfmarker> it should be . Yeah . Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's <disfmarker> once once the mm <vocalsound> um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . Uh-huh , hi <vocalsound> yeah . So <vocalsound> I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . Mm . Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um <vocalsound> uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh <vocalsound> oh yeah are th It's like the <disfmarker> like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel . Yeah , you can't <disfmarker> No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> just a moment , I'll <vocalsound> I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um <vocalsound> it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . <vocalsound> Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . Look , this one here . Oh , it's like the iPod . But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , G yeah , no , you can . it's like you press this or this or <disfmarker> Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh <disfmarker> It's like it's like where you <disfmarker> you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round <vocalsound> Uh-huh . Alright , right . Okay , okay . and it <disfmarker> yeah . It is <disfmarker> So instead of going down you just spin <disfmarker> You just go round yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast . Uh-huh . Mm-hmm . I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . Mm-hmm . Right . Uh-huh . Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , Mm-hmm . but you've got a lot less control over it . Mm-hmm . Right . So maybe I should include that here as well , Mm . L_C_D_s um plus spinning . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . Mm-hmm . It <vocalsound> it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . Um and I I also thought uh <vocalsound> if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is <vocalsound> uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So yeah , that's uh that's it . Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once . Right . Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in um the <disfmarker> The project documents . yeah . Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it . Mm-hmm . Cool . Here it comes . Okay . Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . Mm-hmm . Okay . Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . Okay . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . Mm-hmm . Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . Mm-hmm . Okay . And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . So um <vocalsound> uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? So <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah , sure . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Right . So mm uh so it <vocalsound> That's over on the interface , if if you could put <disfmarker> <disfmarker> yeah , so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? Yeah . Um and an And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning <disfmarker> yeah . so that means we need an advanced thing . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , Mm-hmm . Mm . and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? <vocalsound> Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote Mm . and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . Mm . And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , Right . <gap> so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . Right . It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , You know ? so if you're watching something <disfmarker> Yeah . That's true , yeah , And i it would be like <disfmarker> that's also <disfmarker> I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than <disfmarker> Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . Yeah . But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , Right . like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . Mm . Mm-hmm . So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . Yeah . So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that Mm right . and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , And then you can flip it open . yeah . Okay . So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go Yeah , I think so . because of style and <disfmarker> Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . Right . Yeah . You you agree ? Maarika , yeah ? Yep , yeah . Yeah . Right . So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . Okay ? Go on . Cool . Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . <vocalsound> Sorry , <vocalsound> I discovered clip art . <vocalsound> Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . Do you know ? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ? <vocalsound> Yeah , and possibly even uneven , Mm-hmm . like not not symmet Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . yeah . But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , Mm-hmm . because <disfmarker> I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands Right . so you wanna <disfmarker> you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . Mm-hmm . Mm . Mm-hmm . Um yeah , I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Something a bit squishy and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but I mean y you have to <disfmarker> Yeah , we we have So it could be like a rubbery <disfmarker> we have rubber , <vocalsound> yeah , uh-huh . but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the <disfmarker> um with using <disfmarker> Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh <disfmarker> an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . <vocalsound> Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . Yeah , yeah . To some degree . So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , Uh-huh . so um we could use <vocalsound> titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh <disfmarker> Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things . If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , Yeah , w energy source . <vocalsound> From <vocalsound> from bouncing it . you could just <vocalsound> bounce it up and down <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . <vocalsound> You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um so yeah , um okay . <vocalsound> Mm . So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Mm yeah . Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . Um <disfmarker> You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . Yeah . It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically . Yeah . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? Uh-huh . It uh <disfmarker> No , I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , Mm . but it's curvy , so . Mm . <vocalsound> Uh I think uh <disfmarker> Besides , you have four sides to a thing , Yeah , 'cause the <disfmarker> so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight Yeah . Right . and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? Right . Dunno . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um <vocalsound> according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is <disfmarker> are these three . Yeah . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all . Nothing to <vocalsound> open them . Yeah . Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . Right , yeah , yeah . But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , <vocalsound> 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . <vocalsound> Right . Okay . Okay , cool . Anything else ? What've we got ? Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function . Okay , so . Cool , thanks . Okay ? <vocalsound> Thanks Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . Yeah . Let's let's try to r rub off things and <disfmarker> Yeah , rub off some of those . yeah , <vocalsound> so um <vocalsound> hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> You you got a wind <gap> dynamo , yeah . Yeah uh-hum yeah . it's not <disfmarker> that's not streamlined and sexy , <vocalsound> having a having a wind up . Okay . Um <vocalsound> kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , I think tha but uh <vocalsound> It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ? <vocalsound> it's <disfmarker> Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , I mean if <disfmarker> this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . <vocalsound> Depends how much how much movement it really needs . Kinetic energy it needs <disfmarker> Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . I don't have too much technical information on that , yeah , right . Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option , I'd I'd keep it on . yeah . Um <vocalsound> the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? <vocalsound> Yeah We don't want that It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . it's no <disfmarker> it's not not vegetable . it's <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? <vocalsound> N wood is <disfmarker> I can't n <vocalsound> how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh Mm . you can't make it like thin and <disfmarker> Right . The wood thing . Mm . I can't imagine a m wooden remote control . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case <disfmarker> you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky Yeah <vocalsound> if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , wi mm-mm yeah . Mm . it's it's much more uh <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Yeah , Yeah . and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more <disfmarker> <vocalsound> U yeah wood is not really <disfmarker> yeah . Right . Well it's not very cleanable either , Yeah . <vocalsound> That's true . do you know . Yeah . It's it's not <vocalsound> a practical <disfmarker> I mean it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . Yeah . And splinters and stuff and <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah . okay <vocalsound> wood is out . It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood . Right . Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . Yeah . Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , but uh it seems to be <vocalsound> out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be <disfmarker> You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? Yeah , but you <disfmarker> um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? Mm-hmm . G yeah , yeah . Mm right . Yeah , so for channel numbers but <disfmarker> Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . But I th yeah but <vocalsound> I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of <disfmarker> yeah , it's faster Just for fast <disfmarker> with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um <vocalsound> discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , <vocalsound> Right . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , <vocalsound> but it's it it's more time-consuming . Yeah . Yeah . I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . Mm right . Yeah . And it <disfmarker> yeah <vocalsound> L_ <disfmarker> L_C_D_ . So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? <vocalsound> No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , because it's <disfmarker> uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . Um <disfmarker> The numbers . Yeah . Yeah . Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? Right . Or <vocalsound> on the L_C_D_ we can , you know <vocalsound> <disfmarker> G yeah , Yeah , I would say buttons , I would think buttons , yeah . because it's <disfmarker> Buttons . yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . It's it's the <disfmarker> I I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , So mm <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . Yeah . and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and <disfmarker> they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , Alright . but , you know , I mean most of the time <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there . Yeah . Right . <vocalsound> Okay , so buttons definitely in but <disfmarker> oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um <disfmarker> I think that's what <vocalsound> you guys are gonna do next , <vocalsound> Uh okay . so if we put down the key um <vocalsound> things that we want . Okay , okay , so the components . Yeah . Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I <vocalsound> yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it <vocalsound> it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , <vocalsound> E either or <disfmarker> it's uh <disfmarker> you can al include everything in the spinning if you Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . G yeah . <disfmarker> yeah , yeah , <vocalsound> I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , in that case . Yeah . so you have to decide whether <disfmarker> you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole <disfmarker> if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . Hmm . Mm um <disfmarker> But if you've got a <disfmarker> if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . Ah , but I mean you can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . Th <vocalsound> that would be on one side , uh-huh . I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . Yeah , I um I think so too , <vocalsound> Uh i it <disfmarker> No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . I mean the case would be <disfmarker> yeah You want an outside of rubber the case would be rubber and the the buttons , and then open it up and <disfmarker> Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . Yeah . rubber buttons , but then <disfmarker> Yeah . Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . Yeah . Or maybe like interchangeable cases . Mm-hmm . 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . Right , right . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right , <vocalsound> okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . Right . Mm-hmm . Yeah , and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> That's right , Yeah . that's what they're after . So I'll rub that out . <vocalsound> And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than <disfmarker> Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah I think we <disfmarker> um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or <disfmarker> I guess . That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . Yeah , does <disfmarker> Bananas . <vocalsound> Yeah . Banana's yellow , <vocalsound> yeah , definitely . Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote <vocalsound> the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple Green . Yeah . and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Um <vocalsound> okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We need the advanced <disfmarker> yeah . um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , Yeah . but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , so <vocalsound> it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . Yeah . So I'll rub off the other two . Mm-hmm . So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or <disfmarker> That was the <disfmarker> Oh is <disfmarker> oh the constraint was uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If <disfmarker> We can't have solar panels with rubber , so . yeah . solar panels with the rubber . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think . <vocalsound> Shall we go for <disfmarker> if we're going for rubber , we think uh on <disfmarker> as our case , and then <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah . Yeah . I think uh <vocalsound> We've got five more minutes . we'll have uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , Mm-hmm . a although it does seem uh interesting . Yeah . Yeah . But it does not hold any advantages as such for a <disfmarker> Yeah , It's just a gimmick . mm-hmm . yeah . Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? Mm-hmm . It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so <disfmarker> Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , <vocalsound> Ye yeah , <vocalsound> we we don't have too much information about it , um <disfmarker> but if it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , but it it <disfmarker> I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah . <vocalsound> It's from the company , so <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . Yeah . Okay . Right . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other . Flat on the top . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . Can I pull the <vocalsound> thing out the back of your computer ? Yeah , sure j Just so we can <disfmarker> Sorry , do you want me to <disfmarker> Nothing , it's right , I'm just <disfmarker> There we go . What does um I_C_S_ mean ? I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits . Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ? Yeah . Uh oh now I've gone too far . Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . We're on our way . Okay . <vocalsound> So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip Right . and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber Yep . and the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept , <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and be in bright vegetable colours . Uh-huh . So <vocalsound> w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer <disfmarker> I think it's on the <disfmarker> Imagine it would be inside . Okay . So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , Mm . so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , Mm-hmm . and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . Yeah , okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-mm . Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the <disfmarker> Yeah . On the <disfmarker> You've maybe got , you know <disfmarker> <vocalsound> like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , Mm-hmm . and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , In the centre , yeah , sure . yeah . Mm yeah . Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , Mm-hmm . which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Cool . Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so <disfmarker> in case we have to refer to it . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Mm-hmm . Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own . Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . <vocalsound> I know , I'm hated . Unplug yourself . Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've got a bit tangled up in all this <vocalsound> So but <disfmarker> shall I move away first or shall I stay here with <disfmarker> I dunno , maybe I would car we need to <disfmarker>
Okay . Uh good afternoon . Good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . I hope you enjoyed your lunch . <vocalsound> I did anyway . <vocalsound> Um let's see . Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes . Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? No ? No . <gap> Everything fine ? That's nice . Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials . Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out . And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations . So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? Sure . Okay . I'll start off then . Good luck . <vocalsound> Doh . 'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . 'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and <disfmarker> Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the <disfmarker> These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . So this would be very important that we <vocalsound> at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . This is not really <disfmarker> This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . That would be all . Okay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ? Any questions ? Mayb Mm no . No ? Okay , we go on to the next one . <gap> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> 'kay um yeah . <gap> uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh <disfmarker> I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um <disfmarker> Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and <disfmarker> Uh <gap> we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um <disfmarker> It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah . And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or <disfmarker> A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um <disfmarker> Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um <disfmarker> See . Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . <vocalsound> So um <disfmarker> D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of <gap> looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the <disfmarker> So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh <disfmarker> Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so <disfmarker> Okay . And that's it . Uh thank you . <vocalsound> Okay . About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option . Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen . And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall . Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it . Okay . Thank you . So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . Mm . <vocalsound> 'Kay . So these are the points we have to discuss . Um first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . <gap> Uh so uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Yeah . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's <vocalsound> really an option . <vocalsound> Okay <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light Mm . so it's not a very good option . No . Or the kinetic energy . Yeah . Okay . And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? Well You just <disfmarker> y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . You use it and it works . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Nah . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . That's true . And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . Oh . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um get great popularity for our product . Yeah . But Um wel what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries <gap> . Yeah you could load up the batteries , B b you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough . Uh <disfmarker> Uh so <disfmarker> Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . That's true . <vocalsound> And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . Okay . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . Mm-hmm . Yeah . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . Okay . And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . Yeah . Uh . That's safe . I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? Yeah . That's a good point . Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . Mm . 'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . Yeah , sure . Go ahead . Um so it was open here . Um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . No . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control Mm . I would greatly advise not to do it . Yeah . I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the <gap> Yeah . younger people . But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . 'Kay . It's a bit higher percentage , but <disfmarker> Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use . Yeah . Yeah . And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . Okay . Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point . But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ? Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones . Okay . So pretty large . Yeah . Yeah . I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , No . and it's easy to ignore as well . Yeah . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . And um yeah I think the um <disfmarker> Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the <disfmarker> I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . Yeah . So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well . Yeah . So <disfmarker> And that's the best choice . Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip . Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . Just the advanced . So it's gotta be advanced . Okay 'Kay . <gap> , advanced chip . And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? Um as we saw there is not <disfmarker> Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . Mm-hmm . Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . Mm-hmm . Look I've got a new remote control , and uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well Uh I dunno . <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , Yeah . That's right . if it's just wood-coloured . Mm . But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? Mm I dunno . You don't know ? I'll have to uh research . I think so because <disfmarker> Yeah . Probably . Mm . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape . Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh <disfmarker> Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . Yeah . Change the cases . Yeah . So maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh <disfmarker> You can sell the cases . Yeah . Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the <disfmarker> Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Because that's a <disfmarker> it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , Yeah . which we can get a great advantage point . Yeah that is true . So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . Yeah . Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though . Costs . 'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one . Yeah . Yeah . So So that would <disfmarker> you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , yeah <vocalsound> remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . Well I wouldn't design a telephone <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um Remote . one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . Yeah . Okay . So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . So everybody's okay with the changing covers ? Yes . I think that's a good uh good option . Yeah . Changing case covers . Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . Yes . Yeah . Could you explain that a little more ? Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . Mm-hmm . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . And what would single curved and double curved mean ? Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . Okay . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . So we can pretty much just do whatever we want . Pick one you like , yes . Mm . Okay . 'Kay . That's good . Uh but the form has to be um <disfmarker> It has to <disfmarker> It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ? No just to lie down . <gap> okay . And the the cover of the the docking station is also We'll go for that . on top of the television then ? Or not ? Well or besides it . And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . on the the board . Mm . Does somebody have ideas for a form or Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um <disfmarker> Yeah . Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . So that would be great for that . <gap> Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . For uh <disfmarker> Uh for <disfmarker> For left-handed users also . Yeah yeah . Yep . Mm . Yeah we Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh <vocalsound> uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? For the volume . Or <disfmarker> Or isn't it ? Um well Mm . that could <gap> Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , Yeah okay . and then it's <disfmarker> Uh . <vocalsound> But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . Mm . 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . Yeah but <disfmarker> But you have extra buttons . <vocalsound> Yeah . So people can get confused . Yeah . That is true . Yeah . Especially if they have the same writings on it . See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh <disfmarker> For lefties Can't we make uh <disfmarker> Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> functions as the normal one ? <vocalsound> You mean um <disfmarker> Then you have to <disfmarker> Yeah if <disfmarker> Let's see if I ca A blank one . And then you get <disfmarker> Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . Uh now I have to think . It's a plus and a min . No it's not very handy I think . Mm no . Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> No that's not gonna work . I guess . Maybe we should <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel Yeah . That is true . or <disfmarker> Yeah . It's just uh u using uh your thumb . Y yeah . Yeah . So um it's <disfmarker> I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . Yeah . Yeah . Uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> I think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on . Yeah yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Um yeah So I could draw them out . just <disfmarker> Let's look at the flat case . Oh . It's from the side so it's rather normal . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . So this type should be better for you or better <disfmarker> Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . Easier ? And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . Mm . So th those are the three options we have . 'Kay . Mm . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . <gap> Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . So um <disfmarker> Do you say this um <disfmarker> S uh <disfmarker> Uh you got like uh sort of a <disfmarker> I believe <disfmarker> <gap> There ? Mm-hmm . So um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? Yeah . I think so . Yeah . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh But now it's <disfmarker> we can make it um <disfmarker> Do you have it upside down or <disfmarker> Mm ? Do you have it That's the top . So uh this that's top ? Okay . this top . This down . Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um <disfmarker> Let's see . Um <disfmarker> Colour uh okay . Uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . <vocalsound> Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um <disfmarker> Uh it's an <disfmarker> Yeah . So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and So get your mouse . Yeah . And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh <disfmarker> Yeah . That's a good one . Yeah . Yeah . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top . <vocalsound> Uh rem So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get <disfmarker> <gap> here . Yeah but this place um <disfmarker> If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down . Uh it's <disfmarker> Yeah I dunno um <disfmarker> Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . Yeah . Mm-hmm . It's more logical to have it on top as well <gap> because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . I think i Yeah so <disfmarker> Yeah . On top . So <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page . <gap> . So Yeah . then we get <disfmarker> Here's <disfmarker> That's the curve . Five minutes . <vocalsound> Here the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And then h the rest of the buttons over here . Yeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh <disfmarker> Yeah still here Yeah . jus Yeah . That's <disfmarker> And I'd prefer the corners to be round . Yeah . Yeah . 'Kay . Think that would be better . Should be more bit more friendly , yeah . Friendly on the eye . 'Kay . Supplements . That's okay . Where's my mouse ? Then <disfmarker> We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe . The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder . Okay . And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Which are <disfmarker> Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or <disfmarker> I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . Yeah . Yeah . And then you'll get a message . Yeah . So that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the folders group . Uh yes , it's here . Yeah . <vocalsound> SMARTboard , there it it . So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . Yeah . And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . Thank you . Very good . Okay . Okay .
All hooked up . <vocalsound> Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um <vocalsound> hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not . <vocalsound> Did anyone ? No . Mm . No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there . Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay . Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there . Oh okay , yeah . Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? Yes , I think so . Yep . I'll do that next time . Um <vocalsound> I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent Yeah , the last minute , yeah , at the last minute , yeah . I'm sorry about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . Yeah . Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control <disfmarker> that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say <disfmarker> You said uh targ target groups , yeah ? what does that mean ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , Uh okay , 'kay . yeah . So are <disfmarker> So we need to <disfmarker> yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on Okay . and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ? Alright . <vocalsound> I can go first , You wanna go first ? Okay . Hmm . yeah . Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . <vocalsound> I assume we just pull it out ? Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Um <vocalsound> so f from the <disfmarker> Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we <disfmarker> you don't have to do it now but when <disfmarker> once you go back , Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . Right sure . just so that I don't have to scribble everything down . Uh okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So n uh with uh with regard to the <vocalsound> uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um <vocalsound> a few basic uh components of the remote and uh <vocalsound> se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um <vocalsound> in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and <vocalsound> uh from the user interface person . Hmm . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . <vocalsound> Okay , so <vocalsound> these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um <vocalsound> so basically uh the <disfmarker> as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um <vocalsound> and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um <vocalsound> okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the <vocalsound> the use for television , <vocalsound> in order to keep things simple . Um <vocalsound> also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it <disfmarker> so <vocalsound> it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . <vocalsound> Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um <vocalsound> there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so <vocalsound> I'll basic go over to the <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates <disfmarker> uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . <vocalsound> So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then <disfmarker> so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated <vocalsound> to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Um so <vocalsound> i in my personal preferences um <vocalsound> I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um <vocalsound> uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . <vocalsound> That's about it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thanks . So anything that you would like to know or <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? <vocalsound> No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . <vocalsound> Br Um yeah . Okay . 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . Yeah . Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah , <vocalsound> we definitely need to operate within our constraints , Yeah . but um <vocalsound> unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that . That's fine . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? <vocalsound> I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Yeah , I think that will do . Yeah , okay . Yeah . Okay , so do you want to <disfmarker> Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue <disfmarker> Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? okay , yeah . I think that has to come out of there . Yeah . Mm 'kay . Yeah . <vocalsound> Thanks . Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . <vocalsound> Oh i <vocalsound> Okay , I hope <disfmarker> wait . Should it just <disfmarker> I it'll take some time . It ta takes a little <disfmarker> There's just nothing . Oh , and have you <disfmarker> you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , Oh right , right , right , um <disfmarker> so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . Okay . Nothin okay , something is coming up . Oh , there it is , yeah . <vocalsound> Now it's coming , <vocalsound> It'll come up , it <disfmarker> computer no signal . um uh no signal . No signal ? Why ? Maybe again ? Yeah yeah , it says something now , Oh . My my computer went blank now . adjusting <disfmarker> Okay , adjusting . Adjusting . But <vocalsound> I don't see anything There we go , there we go . Okay . I don't see anything on my computer now . This is the problem , but <disfmarker> Oh , that's strange . Oh , if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . Okay . Um <gap> . And one more time . Okay , so one more time . Uh now it's <disfmarker> okay . No ? No . Should <disfmarker> Mm . yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting . Oh okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay , that's fine , that's good . Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some <vocalsound> some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um <vocalsound> all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . Mm-hmm . Um uh my method was um to look at um other <vocalsound> um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . <vocalsound> And yeah , and then just to um <vocalsound> put the main function of the remote control in in words . Mm-hmm . Um so the findings uh were <vocalsound> um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm <vocalsound> uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um <vocalsound> um <vocalsound> I als <vocalsound> Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? okay . Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , <vocalsound> okay , that's great . 'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm <vocalsound> functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then <vocalsound> there are <disfmarker> surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then <vocalsound> the channel numbers and then um <vocalsound> the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um <vocalsound> could be just <disfmarker> uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um <vocalsound> done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . Mm-hmm . So at the <disfmarker> for the time being that's uh that's all . If you have questions <disfmarker> Yeah . If <disfmarker> I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for <disfmarker> that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about . Yeah , and also it's it's um <disfmarker> other question is uh because there are so many different <disfmarker> And there are so many different things that could possibly be included <vocalsound> because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , Mm-hmm . so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay . <gap> Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? <vocalsound> So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um <vocalsound> so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or <disfmarker> I mean in <disfmarker> we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , I mean um what other options would you have ? Right . A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user Yeah , and it'll make the costs <disfmarker> yeah . and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . Right . Mm-hmm . I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um . Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . Mm . So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um <disfmarker> because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . Mm-hmm . So yeah ? Cool . Mm-hmm . Yep . Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one . Cool . Do you want to <disfmarker> Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ? yeah . Uh am I going in the right direction ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wait . Okay , here it comes . Oh , I'm getting hungry . <vocalsound> Okay , here you are . Cool . Ah , that's why it won't meet . <vocalsound> Okay , cool . You set ? Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements . Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . Alright , yeah . Hello . <gap> try to press <disfmarker> Is it plugged in prop It's working . oh , okay , it's working ? Okay . yep . Excellent . Cool , okay . So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . <vocalsound> Um okay , so . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <vocalsound> Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . <vocalsound> Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but <disfmarker> It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , <vocalsound> Mm . so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , Right . Mm . they just make it look ugly . Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing . Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see . Mm k If you explain it to us it'll be fine . Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . Yeah . What it is is um it's cones , 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . Um but <disfmarker> I liked the , I liked the litt ooh where's it go ? ooh come back . Back . Oh . No . Oh yes , cool . Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . Okay . What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ? <vocalsound> Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses Mm-hmm . and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , Mm-hmm . so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . Mm-hmm . Okay . This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . <vocalsound> Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . Mm-hmm . I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then <vocalsound> that's the least of your problems , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The remote control . <vocalsound> but you know , <vocalsound> it's up there . Mm . Um that <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages <disfmarker> Right . you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ <vocalsound> . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um Hmm . sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . That's alright . Um okay , but that shows how people <disfmarker> whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite <disfmarker> are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking Mm . and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . Right . Um okay ? Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . <vocalsound> So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . Mm . Mm . Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . Um and then like a locator , <vocalsound> so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or <disfmarker> not a mobile phone <disfmarker> Mm . Some kind of a ring , Keys and things like that , some <disfmarker> Yeah , that's it , you know . yeah . Whistle and it <vocalsound> screams at you , yeah . I know , it's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something <vocalsound> <disfmarker> a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , Mm-hmm . Right . 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , <vocalsound> 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . So okay ? Hmm . Cool . That's me . <vocalsound> That's you , excellent . Okay , that's great , <vocalsound> Um that's very good , thanks . very interesting . Um . I'm just gonna tick yes . So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss Mm . <vocalsound> I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um <vocalsound> uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um <vocalsound> uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . Cat's . Ca <vocalsound> . So if we need to have a target group um then uh <vocalsound> I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , Right . but I'm assuming , you know , yes . Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , Yeah . Mm-hmm . so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , Mm-hmm . Yeah . yeah . Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket Right , and the <disfmarker> I don't know how often they're buying televisions . and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Right . Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? Mm . So , you know <disfmarker> Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . Yeah . Yeah , I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and <disfmarker> you share a television or something that <disfmarker> yeah . Right . Yeah . But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ? O oh it's on <disfmarker> Oh , I've unplugged it . sorry , we unplugged it . Do you want me to <disfmarker> Oh , oh , okay . <vocalsound> Here , let me <disfmarker> That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , Yeah . Yeah . wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was <disfmarker> Seventy six point three percent . It was seventy something , yeah , yeah . so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , Yeah . but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like <disfmarker> I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , Yeah , they've got no commitments and but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , Alright . usually not a car and all of those things . you don't normally have a car , yeah , so . Kids . Yeah . Yeah . You're still learning to drive actually , So you're more likely to b so that just costs more than a car , <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> but yeah . Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think . Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . No , I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? Yeah . You know , I think <disfmarker> Yeah this this is not <vocalsound> unaffordable , <gap> but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ <vocalsound> to use its full <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . Yeah . But do they <vocalsound> <disfmarker> We didn't have a T_V_ last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah Common , the students <disfmarker> yeah , yeah . The s the stu and be a bit strange to have a fancy <vocalsound> rome remote . yeah , and the remote control might not <disfmarker> yeah , it might not even function with the old T_V_ . Mm <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? <vocalsound> Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . Mm . Yeah , we're still <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . So mm uh are are are <disfmarker> Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . Yeah . Mm . You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and <disfmarker> I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . Yeah . Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , Yeah . because actually I mean they're all still re young people . Is not a massive difference , you know . Yeah . Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , No , do totally . Mm . but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . Yeah . Is that gonna have a <disfmarker> an implication for the technical specs ? Um <vocalsound> I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? Mm-hmm . Uh and uh <disfmarker> You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like <disfmarker> I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . Yeah . Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway Yeah . and um uh h ho how good is it , Yeah . you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh <disfmarker> I don't know . Yeah . With um <disfmarker> but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , An Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Right . louder , S so <disfmarker> tha that should be relatively simple . Right . Okay . y you'd maybe need a code word . O <vocalsound> Do you know what I mean ? Right . Mm . So like when you say change , except that's <vocalsound> being said quite a lot on T_V_ , so maybe like , you know , remote . I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? Yeah . Mm . Although I only watch Charmed , so really <vocalsound> I wouldn't know <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . Right . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited Yeah . Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . <disfmarker> yeah . Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group Yeah but uh um <disfmarker> and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising . Yeah . I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , Yeah , I think we need both . Mm . W What uh <disfmarker> so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . Yeah . Mm . Mm . What wh uh <vocalsound> what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with <disfmarker> away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Yeah , Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , <vocalsound> that would be another way to do it . So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . some kind of <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because <disfmarker> I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . so then it would be <disfmarker> you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . <vocalsound> Watch Sky and <vocalsound> yeah . Yeah , yeah , Alright . and that would be really annoying . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's <disfmarker> Right . Mm-hmm . But that's definitely a possibility . Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't <vocalsound> as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it Mm . and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Yeah . Yeah . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? <vocalsound> So that you can yell at it , <vocalsound> Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . yeah . It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it <vocalsound> and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Alright . Yeah , but then the remote control I think <disfmarker> I mean <vocalsound> um the idea is kind of <disfmarker> it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then <disfmarker> Mm Mm . yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . being cl I mean it'll it'll <disfmarker> mm . No , but I I I was just defending the <vocalsound> the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . So uh <vocalsound> wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , Mm-hmm . so we we can probably come to know where it is . That's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . but then if you're buying the remote separately , Yeah . but y <vocalsound> you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , Oh yeah , yeah . Right , yeah , yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah , mm-hmm . some <disfmarker> like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . <vocalsound> Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . The l Well that's right , Alright , yeah . but it solves the problem of having different noises . Yeah , definitely , yeah . Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um <vocalsound> specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option The major ones , yeah . Mm-hmm . Right . um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . <vocalsound> Okay . What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break <gap> Mm-hmm . and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . So where exactly is this i It should be on your desktop , so on the <disfmarker> Ah , okay . yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So I'll put it <disfmarker> I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . <vocalsound> Did you find it ? It's just <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah in that one , yeah , yeah . right yeah . Yeah , and email them round . Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? Yeah , that would be great . Okay . Oh so so we'll just put them i there , Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah , we we <disfmarker> yeah , w we won't even <disfmarker> okay . There you go . then you don't have to email them . But is everyone's called functional requirements ? No , No . they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah . Okay , so that's good . Yeah . That's me done . So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . Okay , cool . Um <vocalsound> as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . Right . Yeah ? Whatever that means . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I guess I'll find out . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You'll be looking <vocalsound> you'll be looking at the user interface concept , <vocalsound> Uh something conceptual , yeah . on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ? Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . Components , Hmm . <vocalsound> Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch yeah . or <vocalsound> shall we prepare our <disfmarker> No , we have we have <disfmarker> after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good . so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . Okay . Okay ? Right on time . <vocalsound> Cool . <vocalsound> Okay , <vocalsound> so you can <disfmarker> I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , see you .
'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , Yeah . so in that sense <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , sure . so it does kind of make sense , yeah . Okay , well <disfmarker> It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of <vocalsound> talking about action and design as opposed to background . Yep . Okay . Everything I have is kinda background . Okay we all ready to go ? Yep . Well how um on the <disfmarker> in this meeting then if we um <disfmarker> I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . And we uh decided on Yep . decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um <vocalsound> . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . Um so that was the last meeting . Is there anything <disfmarker> have I forgotten anything ? Mm-hmm . No . Uh that sounds <gap> . Is that everything ? Okay . Um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of <disfmarker> that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . That might be a better idea this time . Sure . And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David , Okay . if that's alright . Sure . Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right <vocalsound> . Yep . Yeah , cool . So if you wanna take this . Why don't I get that <vocalsound> ? Hmm . <vocalsound> Screwed in quite tightly . Uh what did <disfmarker> uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? We <disfmarker> did we say we were gonna try <disfmarker> maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? Mm-hmm . Right . Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . Okay . <vocalsound> So um <vocalsound> that's kind of the end result hopefully . Okay . Um alright so c is it function F_ eight ? <vocalsound> Uh-huh . Hopefully appear in a wee second . Hmm . Come on . I think it's working . Up there we go . Okay great s so let me just start this . <vocalsound> Okay great . So um <vocalsound> uh s move on . Uh-huh <disfmarker> oh where'd it all go ? <vocalsound> Oh no . It's not good . Okay lemme just see where I can find it . This looks more like it . I think I just opened up the template . Sorry about that . Oh right . Okay alright so let's have a look here . Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . Here we go . Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . Okay . And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see <disfmarker> sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project . Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ? Mm-hmm . Yep . I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this . Aye a fair point definitely . Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . Okay . Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Number two was that it be innovative . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um <vocalsound> quite user friendly while still having technology . So it <disfmarker> I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um <vocalsound> what we should think about is how the um <vocalsound> about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . <vocalsound> For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , Aye right . like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative Uh-huh . because obviously the thing that <disfmarker> the message here is ease of use . So how do you make innovation make something more <vocalsound> more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this . Okay . Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . Uh top European fashion trend um <vocalsound> that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , do you know what I mean ? Okay okay . So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um <vocalsound> so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , I think that would be pushing it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is <disfmarker> which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . Um <disfmarker> So these this is the summary of everything . Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen <disfmarker> it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . That was like the number three thing . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , Mm-hmm . something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . You know what a Mac iPod is ? Mm that's true , yeah . I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of <disfmarker> or more of like a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um <vocalsound> techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a <disfmarker> I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . Um <disfmarker> Does that make sense ? Yeah . So <vocalsound> so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their <disfmarker> what people associate this <disfmarker> them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . Mm 'kay . Great . Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and <disfmarker> Okay . So anyway it's just just an idea . Yeah . I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> into something which is <disfmarker> which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up . Ah . How can we build on that ? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . Okay . Anyway those are <disfmarker> that's all I have , but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into <disfmarker> That's great . Uh-huh . Okay great . <gap> Um thank you for that . Uh Craig do you wanna Yep . uh plug yours in then ? Is it working ? <vocalsound> Mm . Not quite . Did you press F_ eight ? It's probably not sending . Yeah . Oh something coming now , yeah . <vocalsound> Yep , there it is . There we go . And so think of this concept . Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um <disfmarker> So then this <disfmarker> we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . Mm . Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . Um they're not very attractive to look at , <vocalsound> and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're <disfmarker> I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . Um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , uh it really should be . It's uh something the user then uh identify with . This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control <vocalsound> um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The buttons should be large . They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . They should be easy to press , very comfortable . <vocalsound> Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um <vocalsound> there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , Mm-hmm . so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . Um should avoid s things like that . Um <vocalsound> if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . Okay . Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . Yeah . Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ? <vocalsound> I think it's yellow I didn't know . because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , <vocalsound> Okay . so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , And the Play-Doh 's yellow <vocalsound> . Okay . Fantastic . <vocalsound> Okay . but keep going and we'll discuss it after . Um Yeah . any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Um if we did decide to go for voice activation <vocalsound> there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> we should definitely avoid the big square block look . That's just wrong . Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department , <vocalsound> and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . Mm . So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take Aye that's a good idea , yeah . and <gap> possibility . Right and these are problems I've had with it . Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . I think it's um , fashion into electronics . Yeah . And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Okay . That's it . Cool . Okay . Great . <vocalsound> Lots of good information there . Yeah that that was very good , Mm-hmm . and uh now with David . Mm 'kay um . <vocalsound> I think I'm cool . It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle <gap> <vocalsound> of the table , <vocalsound> I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . huh ? Just um <disfmarker> Oops . Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um <disfmarker> Yeah okay . Let me just get this going first . Yeah . Ah there it is . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It takes a second , doesn't it ? 'Kay , that should be it . Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic . <vocalsound> So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , Mm-hmm . um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . Um the components are exactly the same . Mm-hmm . Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost . And the power is basically a factor of that . Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said <disfmarker> we've defined , like we only want the basic things that <disfmarker> to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . Mm-hmm . So um you know it's just a matter of working out space . So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . So just go through it in the components . Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . Right . Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . Mm . Hmm . So maybe if you <disfmarker> well I could see the other email that they sent you , um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements <vocalsound> , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons , Right . Mm . okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , Mm-hmm . okay there's an L_C_D_ display , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um I think these are quite standard things . They're standard , aren't they ? No um they're <disfmarker> well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . Yeah . Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination , Mm-hmm . um but um I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . We <disfmarker> you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't <disfmarker> I'm not very sure about the titanium . Yeah . They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . Hmm . Mm 'kay . Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , Okay . so I think that there is some restriction on um <disfmarker> I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , Mm-hmm . but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . You know as opposed to two . Mm-hmm . Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit um and that impacts cost . Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Power consumption should be about the same . Um I think the main impact is complexity , Hmm . um and the other thing is um the power options . Um the first one is a standard battery . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , <vocalsound> it's a wind-up <vocalsound> you know , a crank <vocalsound> . I'll clear one of these things for you . Just by moving it yeah . Hmm . Yeah but that that might be something <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . Mm . <vocalsound> No . Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , Yeah . which may not be a great idea in Europe or <vocalsound> any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . <vocalsound> So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their <disfmarker> Mm . and it's a nice sales gimmick I think . From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , Mm-hmm . it's a shake it <vocalsound> it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . You know W yeah . Hmm . you know you have <disfmarker> you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , Uh yeah yeah , I see . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . Hmm . You know just to <disfmarker> Yeah . if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , <vocalsound> kind of <vocalsound> you know just uh you know um <disfmarker> so . Um okay Hmm . I know what you mean yeah . my <disfmarker> from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think um something comfortable to hold , Mm-hmm . um small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of <disfmarker> small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . Mm-hmm . Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . Mm-hmm . Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it <disfmarker> um so . Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . Mm . <vocalsound> Um the case <disfmarker> okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that um , <vocalsound> titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and It can't be curved . it can't be curved Okay . on the wood . So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , Okay . um especially the titanium I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need . Right . So um <vocalsound> mixing them may not be a good idea Okay . um yep . That's it . Right can I <disfmarker> Uh question on <disfmarker> can I ask a question ? Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so <disfmarker> Okay . but yeah you c ask away . Can we uh power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light Mm . Okay . so that <disfmarker> So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . Why what kind of light do you want <disfmarker> are you thinking of ? Well <disfmarker> I mean I'm thinking it might be <disfmarker> That <disfmarker> for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it Uh-huh . Yeah . and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive . Illuminate the buttons . Yeah it glows . Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , Okay . and that's what everybody does . Oh where's the volume button in the dark , Yeah yeah yeah . Okay . and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone . Okay . Like a phone , yeah yeah . Okay cool . Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . Yeah . We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? Mm . um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . Right . So you could trigger that to a light , Sure . Mm . like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light Okay . Okay . as opposed to <disfmarker> Right . so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the Okay . Mm-hmm . Right glowingness . okay um well <vocalsound> Okay , great . let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . Okay . So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an <gap> decision on the the the concepts of the product . <vocalsound> Okay . So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . Yeah . Yeah . Um I mean what does everybody think about <disfmarker> Does anybody have any ideas of <disfmarker> about how we can fit all that in together ? I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? Um <vocalsound> I think we could go for like um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . So maybe <disfmarker> do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or <disfmarker> Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . So something quite curvy ? Okay um right okay . Colour-wise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Whose <disfmarker> I think he made that . What's that ? about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . Yeah . Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow Okay . I don't know . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And then obviously the uh the materials <disfmarker> when it <disfmarker> has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , That's all . and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um <vocalsound> the look and feel . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the <disfmarker> on the um <vocalsound> the colour , you said company colour yellow . Mm-hmm . I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , Mm-hmm . what <disfmarker> can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the Okay . shapes and things . Right . Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? Like does marketing have any research on <disfmarker> does it need to be long ? <vocalsound> Does it need <disfmarker> with a square thing wha Oh you know like in circular in shape or <disfmarker> Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of <disfmarker> Yeah . Choice of material yeah . Like fruit . 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well <disfmarker> you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , <vocalsound> I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . See I'm <disfmarker> and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels <disfmarker> it feels kind of warmer to the touch . It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . And then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well I'm <disfmarker> do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or <disfmarker> No no no not at all . no I don't think we do either <vocalsound> . It's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . Do you know what I mean ? Okay right well um <vocalsound> so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . A snowman shape ? Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . Uh-huh . That's quite a distinctive shape , Right , that would be good sure . wouldn't it . Yeah . Yeah so yeah should we go with that ? Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a <disfmarker> Do you wanna draw it on the board ? <vocalsound> Can you like <disfmarker> yeah just t we can visualize it . Um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside Okay . Ooh that'd be good . or uh you have volume controls about there . Okay . Mm-hmm . Yep . So call it the snowman-shape trademark <vocalsound> . Yeah that's cool . Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white <disfmarker> do you want something <disfmarker> Mm . So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this <gap> here , had a sorta background yellow , <vocalsound> Uh-huh . and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . Okay cool . Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . Or when you like <disfmarker> or if you turn it off or something <disfmarker> if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . I think that might scare me . I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? I think that'd probably scare me . You turn it on your control possessed s <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I know . Um unless an a I mean if you <disfmarker> also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? Would we put that on the inside or <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? What what's the functionality of that ? It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . Yeah but the question is what are we using it <disfmarker> What would it achieve ? what would we what would we achieve from it ? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> L_C_ well I'd <disfmarker> when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , Right , okay . so um it's a bit nuts to get the <gap> Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know . Mm oh yeah that's true . Yeah . So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but um it's <disfmarker> what's what what would it tell the user , I think that would make it very complex . 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? Yeah . Yeah . Mm not real We have the option of the speaker as well <disfmarker> the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? <vocalsound> I don't know if there is really , Mm-hmm . Nah . no um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> I would say no need for a talk-back . Uh does anybody disagree with that ? No . You could put a game on it <vocalsound> . No ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Easy <vocalsound> . When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control <vocalsound> . Mm mm . Okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? Um <vocalsound> well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . Okay . B um I think the <gap> we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . Okay right um what else do you need to talk about ? Well i I was just <disfmarker> Where would you physically position the buttons ? Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things . Yeah <gap> . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Um maybe you wanna draw onto the <disfmarker> So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about . Yep . Oh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go . Um energy what <disfmarker> do you think that's suggesting we're <disfmarker> how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , Yeah , sure . Um I've had kinetic things before , I mean what does anybody think about that ? and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches yeah <disfmarker> No , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just <disfmarker> Sure , okay , right , okay . Okay . Support for it . I mean just <disfmarker> Yeah . it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , Mm-hmm . and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . I've also known people to have <vocalsound> things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time . Yeah . Yep . Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . Yeah . So we should think about <disfmarker> Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . So you'd have the battery as the kind of <disfmarker> to keep it ticking over idea <disfmarker> Yeah . I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . Yep . Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here . Chip on print , is that <disfmarker> that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? Yes yes . Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that <disfmarker> And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of <disfmarker> Yeah I think so yeah . Okay . Um just a a lot of the um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , Mm-hmm . um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . Mm 'kay . Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme <disfmarker> like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ? <vocalsound> Like <disfmarker> Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . Okay so so backlighting , that would be good . Or even a clear case . Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , Yeah clear , Aye that would be a good idea . Okay . but in the dark it sort of , it's alive <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah sure . Um in in a slight subtle way . S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . Yeah that'd be really good . Yeah yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Is that what you mean ? Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . Sure . You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . Yeah , yeah . So the power <disfmarker> the battery in that sense , maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights Yeah . Sure . that sort of <disfmarker> Yeah they they emanate a light through it . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . Lights . 'Kay . Yeah , mm-hmm . Okay . Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . Mm . Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? Or <disfmarker> Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , Mm . Yeah . Yeah . whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . Mm-hmm . Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ? If you're holding it in your hand you could <disfmarker> That's a very unnatural motion to <disfmarker> Do you think ? yeah . Okay . Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . Um it might work for volume , Yeah . and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , Mm . but not for channels right . If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , Mm-hmm . you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to <vocalsound> . Yeah Yeah . okay okay Yeah , Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the <disfmarker> sure . um <gap> <disfmarker> Mm . Well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part . I dunno . Yeah . But users tend to tend to want to use that Yeah . and once they lose out on the user experience they're like <disfmarker> Okay . Uh but <disfmarker> Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of <disfmarker> Okay . But that's not a bad thing is it ? Just <disfmarker> Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . Yeah . Yeah . Jog dials are much easier than that . Okay You just roll . um right well wouldn't it <disfmarker> we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . Um I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite <disfmarker> you know th very quick to m to use . Yeah . Yeah . So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? No . And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? Yeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , Uh-huh . I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh-huh ooh okay , I dunno . we really gotta wrap up so yeah . Yeah . It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , Okay well if we can do that , great . and that yeah <disfmarker> Yeah okay . well I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ? Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there Yeah . um , and <disfmarker> And then like a jo So you wanna expand the shape of the <disfmarker> And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the <disfmarker> That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . It would get bumped , it's <disfmarker> doesn't really fit with your hand . Yeah . Mm . Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here . Mm . Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ? Okay . <vocalsound> Right I'm gonna have to <disfmarker> A jog di I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . Yeah . It's kind of yeah <disfmarker> Um is there anything anybody's unsure about ? Just for <disfmarker> in closing just <disfmarker> the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , Yeah . uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . So um <vocalsound> that'll be that'll be good . Huh . Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ? Um <disfmarker> Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um <disfmarker> Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , Yeah that's what I was thinking the <disfmarker> that'd be great . a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . Yeah . Yep . I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . There's lots of space for it um <disfmarker> Okay . That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function <disfmarker> Sure , yeah , yeah Okay . and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , <gap> Yeah . Yeah . and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . To make something flush with the case ? Something a bit more flush , yeah , Okay right . or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , so that it has <disfmarker> Okay . and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . Sp kinda grippy ? Feel like fruit . Okay . <vocalsound> Fruits kids <vocalsound> . They feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , No like <disfmarker> Yeah yeah . they're actually just plastic that's textured , kind of a little bit like <disfmarker> Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah . Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . So um that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so . Okay . So off you go and design stuff Okay . wooh <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Play-doh time . Yeah quite jealous actually . You got to choose first . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , we're kidding . Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters . <vocalsound> Okay lemme <disfmarker> okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . It's you . Argh . This is a real hassle and a <disfmarker> oops . I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's <disfmarker> too lazy t take them off again . Cool .
Afternoon guys . It's gonna be <gap> . Rock and roll . Oh . <vocalsound> <gap> 'Kay . So do we need to re-train Mike on how to put his mic on ? Think s We may do . Okay , can he get it all by himself this time ? I dunno , I'm feeling like a big boy . Mm . Pro <gap> Probably not , 'cause he's 'S been listening to <gap> too much . So <disfmarker> He's getting retarded . Yay . I believe I can fly . Alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys . Or not . Or not . <vocalsound> Yeah . Just what I needed was something exciting . Remember , I'm an old man . <vocalsound> 'Kay , ready to go ? All ready . 'Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting . Apparently I'm old as well . Hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now . Thirty's really young , eh ? <vocalsound> We do . Uh k exciting ideas . 'Kay so here's our agenda our agenda . Um <vocalsound> I'm gonna open . I'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do . I'm gonna take some notes . We're gonna all do a presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now . <vocalsound> Yep . <vocalsound> Alright . Well when I say hopefully , we have to . So I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions . And does anyone really want to go first ? <vocalsound> I guess I'll go first . You p two ? Yeah . What's <disfmarker> Component , I think . Yeah . Components design . Yep that's it . Presented by name . <vocalsound> My name is <vocalsound> . Jose he man is . <vocalsound> Your name is name ? My name is name . Huh hi name . My name is Inigo Montoya . <vocalsound> You killed my father . <vocalsound> Sorry Prepare to die . <vocalsound> I did this in a bit of a rush . N name . So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . Right . <vocalsound> Um you've got <vocalsound> a printed <vocalsound> a printed uh circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber <vocalsound> nubbies into these little holes that activate <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've <disfmarker> Yeah we've all broken a remote control . <vocalsound> So you've also got um <disfmarker> you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . Um <disfmarker> I just love you tech guys , huh . Yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You press this and it does th <vocalsound> Yeah y do jabber <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so you've got <disfmarker> here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> I dunno who and whatnot . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> exactly . Nah . So um we've got a <disfmarker> i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip <vocalsound> I dunno . P Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh it's two double A_ batteries . This is pretty standard remote . So here are options for our power sources . You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um <vocalsound> th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . <vocalsound> 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I wanna change that <vocalsound> . I don't know if that's really <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I gotta I gotta flashlight , and uh <disfmarker> I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . You shake it . yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like this <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy , And that's on the camera <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it <vocalsound> . Yeah . 'Kay . Uh we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night <vocalsound> which doesn't make a lot of sense . Mm 'kay . And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? M battery versus cradle I think is <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . I like the kinetic . So we have battery versus cradle <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I g I I figured you would . Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah . It could be fun <vocalsound> . It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here , Yeah . you could <disfmarker> Well it is it is more uh <disfmarker> I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . So um Mm . Hmm . our case design . We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh <disfmarker> Yeah pers Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . I think wood i <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It it it <disfmarker> Nah . I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know . Uh . Okay . Hmm . Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever <disfmarker> whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . Right . And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some <disfmarker> a couple of these . Okay . Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a <disfmarker> to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic . 'Kay . Do you get a good grip on the rubber ? Yeah um <disfmarker> Yeah okay . <vocalsound> And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . Yeah . You don't even need to lean down to get it . <vocalsound> The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is <disfmarker> w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape <vocalsound> because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . So um <disfmarker> and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um <disfmarker> Okay . But basically these are <vocalsound> curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their um <vocalsound> in their <vocalsound> message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . I have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , <vocalsound> uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . Okay . <vocalsound> I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes Okay . or surfaces . I have no idea . I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a <disfmarker> Mm-hmm yeah that's <disfmarker> yeah that's what I see . Oh okay oh like a wave , okay . yeah that's what <gap> . Yeah that's what I see also . Alright that makes sense okay . Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , Ooh . or multiple scrolling wheels . Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh <disfmarker> has at his disposal to put together a user interface . Okay . For electronics , we have these very technical um <vocalsound> descriptions here . A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , <vocalsound> a regular chip , which is <vocalsound> like the medium porridge <disfmarker> the <vocalsound> medium expense uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? Yes the difference is , with a simple chip <disfmarker> a simple chip will operate <disfmarker> oh why doesn't this scroll up ? Previous previous , okay . A simple chip is required to operate push buttons . Um <vocalsound> an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display , Okay . and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . Okay . So but yeah . Yeah that makes sense . That's the end of my presentation . So presentation from <disfmarker> I guess design would go best . Next . Technical functions or interface concept ? I think <disfmarker> Oh interface concept . <vocalsound> Very long presentation . <vocalsound> Yeah that's it . <vocalsound> Yes , but it has your name on it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . Um so , somehow that thing's too big , but um <disfmarker> okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so . No . No . It it it <disfmarker> you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If the T_V_ is working , yeah . That's just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean it'll <disfmarker> if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel . Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , So <disfmarker> and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep . But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? So if you pressed it and went , up ? <vocalsound> That kinda would r d Well then why don't you just press the up button ? yeah . Man yeah . That would kind of lose it . But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go <disfmarker> That's right . Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ . Up . <vocalsound> It might not be it might not be completely confusing , Yeah , okay . but I think you'll still y it's still <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't think it's practical at all . I think it's a bad idea frankly . Yeah so um taking that away , our uh <disfmarker> the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable <disfmarker> Okay . You guys know your stuff . it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . Um as for the point that we making about losing it . Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost , That I would believe . about <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Mm . <vocalsound> But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow . Um so <vocalsound> the the <disfmarker> what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without <disfmarker> with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . Mm-hmm . And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? Ye no it's not That's not a scroll wheel . i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , Nah . Oh okay okay . I see . so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that <gap> alone . Right . Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . Uh , okay . Okay . Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , <vocalsound> so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost . That be it . 'Kay . So on to <disfmarker> Y functional requirements or trend watching ? I dunno . Trend watching has a later date there . Trend watching I guess . Trend watching I believe . <gap> forty six nineteen fifty seven . Yep . See what it looks like . It's been so long . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . Well <vocalsound> I don't know what to say . When I s when I see the <disfmarker> when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . I see so many of 'em out there . There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . Are you talking about the picture ? Yeah yeah . That's not our that's not our b design , that's just a <disfmarker> that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . Okay . Okay . Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet . And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . Mm . That's what I understand so , Upper management said yes . hello . Uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam . And and so <disfmarker> yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin <vocalsound> there are so many people making these products at this price right now . What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ? What's special and unique about a scroll ? Uh <vocalsound> well I don't <disfmarker> It's cool . yeah it's <disfmarker> I I just see it as different . I don't say it's specially mm <disfmarker> I don't say it's special . Uh I say that it's different I <disfmarker> what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . I need something to market about this thing . We're we're a new firm . I'd I'd say though that we <disfmarker> if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , What i <vocalsound> if when when we have <disfmarker> but wi with a similar <disfmarker> yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's <disfmarker> as as a marketing standard <disfmarker> I need something to market , to make this product unique . Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the <disfmarker> having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , Yep . having it look really nice um and also be really durable . Mm 'kay . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . Right yeah . Yeah . Mm . Course . And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase . Yeah 'cause that's <gap> . <vocalsound> And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet . Mm . So I need a product . Mm 'kay . Well let's get a product then . I need a product to market . And I just <disfmarker> whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . Tha that I'm not concerned with . So now <disfmarker> If you if you give me <disfmarker> if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost . So our big <vocalsound> questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ? Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? Function-wise , what does that do that <disfmarker> Oh but that was in your presentation <vocalsound> so wh what would you imagine it doing ? Yeah wh wh what's the <vocalsound> wh <vocalsound> Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . <vocalsound> Mm 'kay Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . But would we <disfmarker> So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . Yeah . If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co <vocalsound> it's a very competitive market . What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . Yeah . Th they are gonna be more expensive , So I d but on the other hand , I mean , it <disfmarker> I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know <disfmarker> if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use <disfmarker> if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . I don't think volume <disfmarker> or do you think volume would be <disfmarker> I dunno . I'll bet first in volume maybe . I dunno . No we can <disfmarker> we can do multiple scroll wheels but <disfmarker> Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the <vocalsound> uh dock to put it in <disfmarker> to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . Mm-hmm . It s i m makes it easy to market , Yeah yeah . it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so . I think it's <disfmarker> that's right . I think so . And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus Mm-hmm . because you're not going to be ditching it as often . It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle . Mm . So if we can market it in terms of that Yep . and yeah well <disfmarker> I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , Yeah . and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . So our big decision then is like how do we do um like <vocalsound> <disfmarker> we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh <disfmarker> What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . Mm-hmm . I'm thinking <disfmarker> yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , <vocalsound> where there's <disfmarker> you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused <disfmarker> the plastic with rubber on the outside . Okay . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of <disfmarker> Okay . So then if we <vocalsound> <disfmarker> d d do we want to do anything more basic with the <disfmarker> uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for <vocalsound> um buttons , or do we want <disfmarker> if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? Do we want to give <disfmarker> do we want to have anything else on it ? It's only a T_V_ . Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing <disfmarker> I mean it's <disfmarker> you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you <vocalsound> just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . Hmm . It receives no information . Okay . So I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . Yeah . Yeah right now there's <disfmarker> right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the <disfmarker> a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the , Right . I don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either . Don't see it . Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on <disfmarker> well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . <vocalsound> So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? <vocalsound> What what overall things have we not decided on ? Well we have to <disfmarker> I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? What do you guys like in the user interface ? I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ? <vocalsound> Again . Well I think it's it's <disfmarker> the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . It's just another <disfmarker> it's just a an idea , and I don't know <disfmarker> Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because <vocalsound> I think , as far as durability th it's not a big <disfmarker> well maybe when it's closed . I mean what I see <disfmarker> one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , <vocalsound> their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . Mm-hmm . This <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . And what I keep throwing out there <disfmarker> I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . Mm-hmm . But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . Yeah and I guess th th the question th <vocalsound> th that you're being asked right now is whether <disfmarker> is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . Oh okay phew . Yeah . I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . Well <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ? Um <vocalsound> we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine . No it's just different . But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna . Integrated , yeah . Yeah . So it's just uh I I think that's <disfmarker> It should be a really simple signal though so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control . And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . That's true yeah . But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? It's <disfmarker> Oh yeah yeah . It'll be really cheap . Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Maybe not <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Makes your living room more fresh as you watch <vocalsound> . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Okay we're doing well for time here . S Um we've got about another ten minutes . I think that uh <disfmarker> So the scroll wheel , in or out ? Mm pr my personal preference is out . I don't think the cost is justified <vocalsound> for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used . Yeah . Yeah I think we have <disfmarker> like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it it breaks down easier . Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ W because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so <disfmarker> Sure . if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? Yeah . <vocalsound> You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to <disfmarker> Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . Uh I see I see . That's where you <disfmarker> Yeah . That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . <vocalsound> Ah I see I see what you're talking about now . Okay . It's just <disfmarker> it's basically <disfmarker> it it's just a f look and feel thing . It has the same exact functionality as two buttons . <vocalsound> I I think there's <disfmarker> you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing <disfmarker> are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . Instead of going button-to-bu you just <vocalsound> j you'd j j j j j j . Yeah if you're just sitting there going <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing . That's kinda cool actually . I like that . Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . Well there's ano But <disfmarker> Well not n necessarily . You could basically make it so that it'll <disfmarker> I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . Right . That's right . If you do that . Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , Other than click click click . but I think once people get used to it <disfmarker> Yeah . I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably . Mm-hmm . Yeah I think so . I I think so . <vocalsound> Primarily . Yep . Now the the only thing I I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> on the interface side of it , is that <vocalsound> I I I see the dilemma . <vocalsound> But if we have the option of of scrolling <vocalsound> at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . Mm-hmm . So I can go uh <vocalsound> presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . <vocalsound> I know what <disfmarker> because it's on the television . The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . So <vocalsound> I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ? Mm-hmm . So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? You understand what I'm saying ? I think I know what you might be getting at , or or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh I see so if <disfmarker> maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? Oh no And then it <disfmarker> that basically <disfmarker> we could read it from the television . Well , what about this <disfmarker> what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , Mm . Well that's quite cool . and it c it <disfmarker> You'd need a display on the th the thing . Why ? It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ . Yeah the the television can tell you . Yeah . Can . Oh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about . Yeah that's kinda cool . How would you program it though ? Well you just <disfmarker> it's one extra button . You say programme start , and then type in <disfmarker> Put <disfmarker> 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . Okay okay . So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , <vocalsound> thirty eight , enter , programme end . And then . Okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go <disfmarker> it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah that's kinda cool . I like that . And again we have another another great marketing tool . We have about three <disfmarker> we have three or four things here . <gap> That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be <disfmarker> you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . Mm-hmm . You could basically <vocalsound> come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply . I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . Yeah . This may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services . Might be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . The problem we're gonna have is making it robust . Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . Making it last . Or we go directional up <vocalsound> we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other . So if there's a button <vocalsound> for each type . No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels . Yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they <disfmarker> Ah-ha okay . Okay , okay , well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . Right . I think we'll need a <vocalsound> we'll need a mode switch , Yeah yeah the mode switch . but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator Just the lights behind the buttons . to which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_ <disfmarker> You could have back-lit buttons maybe . okay . <gap> Yeah . Would that work ? Is that <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . okay we have five minutes . <vocalsound> So right details th <vocalsound> that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> We want <vocalsound> a mode indicator . We want <vocalsound> back-lit buttons . And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . I've seen some remotes do that . Okay . Just so you know I think <disfmarker> I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range . Yeah yeah . I think we are yeah . I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that . Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . Yeah Didn't you say so ? well we don't have <vocalsound> it's not that we have more money , we can push up the the price . That's what I mean . We can increase the cost . Yeah . Okay . So I don't know I don't know whether having <disfmarker> 'Kay . I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . So <disfmarker> Yeah . So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ? Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit . Yeah no I I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . Right . We're entering a new market here , so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to <disfmarker> Okay I'm I'm okay with that . I guess what I just want <disfmarker> to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ? Well y yeah . Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for We have to find cost . <disfmarker> with all these features <disfmarker> how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ? But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market . I'm just asking you . I'm a student , but on the other hand I would think , mm with my Project Manager salary , I would think <disfmarker> yeah I could probably afford this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Then you could probably afford this <vocalsound> . uh would I buy it ? Maybe . If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . Then maybe you know . I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly , Oh no no . that would be way too much , but the <disfmarker> I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much <disfmarker> I would say thirty five to forty . Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty . 'Kay . Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . Okay . So the question is what we ca we make it for . Because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . Right . Mm . It's one of the marketing features in this . That's why the scroll needs to be really robust . Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator . Mm-hmm . With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons . <gap> And it's gonna look sexy <vocalsound> . Or not <vocalsound> . Or not . It might look like clay <vocalsound> . Okay so you can market pe depending on that ? Yeah yeah . Bas th that's that's easy . That's that's not a , it's a <gap> . 'Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone . Yep . Under the title of uniquenesses . Cool . Hmm . Okay . The next meeting starts in thirty <vocalsound> minutes , although does it ? It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . So we've got more than a thirty minutes . Um <vocalsound> we've got more like fifty . Well I have <disfmarker> Is my <disfmarker> three twenty one is the next meeting ? The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah . That's that's almost uh fifty minutes . Yeah that is . Uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations . <vocalsound> You guys can <disfmarker> You guys you guys can uh create a <disfmarker> All kinds of things . Probably . We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . <gap> Thanks , yeah . Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ? I don't think so . If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah I think it <disfmarker> pretty much everything's covered . Okay . This one was quite easy . Coulda been worse . Still . Always the optimist . Yes I am . 'Kay thanks guys . Thank you . I don't have any emails . This means I can go home . Oh , we all leave . <gap>
Is this okay ? Uh yeah . Fine now . Oh , it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . Computer adjusting . Oh . Uh . Okay . <vocalsound> So . Right . You ready back there ? <vocalsound> Uh okay . Welcome everyone . Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . Okay . The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . The originality um is gonna take all of us . Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at <disfmarker> for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . Um and we'll get on with it . Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . Okay ? Right . Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess <disfmarker> Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on . And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . Uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Uh I do not think so , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are we all gonna draw a cat ? I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Only animal I could thin I could draw <vocalsound> . I know . <vocalsound> Ah <vocalsound> . Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . Uh-huh . Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of <disfmarker> Okay . Right , yeah . Great . And the characteristics ? Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um <disfmarker> the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw . Uh-huh . In fact , I'll give it some more <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh , Okay . and the tail Fantastic . Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph . I think it's to get us used to using the pen . <vocalsound> Yes . Um sure it's not to test our artistic <disfmarker> Uh no . <vocalsound> It's a mouse . A mouse-y ? That's not a mouse-y , no . No it's not a mouse . It's a wombat . Oh . It's a ratty . Argh . A what ? A ratty . Rat . Not a mouse , a rat . A webbed foot . Webbed f <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's clothes . That's it's clothes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh right <vocalsound> . It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail . And your favourite characteristics of that animal . I love whiskers . Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky <vocalsound> and uh fantastic pets and very friendly . Oh . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And they sit on your shoulder Kate ? and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework . <vocalsound> Thanks . Oh , a fish . <vocalsound> Gosh , A shark ? why didn't I think of fish ? That's even easier to draw than cat . <vocalsound> Mm <vocalsound> this is very representational fish . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , okay . Fine . Um I like them because they're sleek Favourite characteristics ? and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so . 'Kay . <vocalsound> So Do you have a favourite one ? they have team elements . <vocalsound> I'm afraid I'm with Steph . And I think your pen's running out of whatever . But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> He's hiding . <vocalsound> Um cats are sometimes very independent . My parents had cats . Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . Okay . Now um <vocalsound> we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold <disfmarker> um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh <disfmarker> can you do the maths and how many are we selling ? <vocalsound> Uh yeah . <vocalsound> I was just wondering if that's the um <disfmarker> If fifty percent is normal <disfmarker> Mark-up ? B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent . But um let me <disfmarker> Okay . I have two thoughts . One hundred , fifty percent . And and your question is how many do we have to sell ? <gap> Yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is <disfmarker> has to do with marketing of <disfmarker> you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . At twenty five . Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's um <disfmarker> To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . So that's four million of them ? Something like that ? Okay . Yeah . That's fifty million Euros . In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each <disfmarker> And if we make <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . That's a lot of selling . Yeah . Two four <disfmarker> Four million . To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million . Hmm . Okay ? Right . Experience with a remote control . Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a <disfmarker> in a home environment , for a T_V_s and <disfmarker> You're both nodding , Yeah . all three . Well I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . It is true that you always sit around <disfmarker> you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Y yeah . And they don't always talk to each other . But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television . Don't know . <vocalsound> Okay . Are there any um ideas for the remote ? What would it be for and what group would be be for ? We have to think about that one . We could make a Hello Kitty <vocalsound> themed remote . <vocalsound> I think one in b bright colours would be good . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think one that works would be good . <vocalsound> We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great <vocalsound> products . Electrical <disfmarker> their industrial design is very good . I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . Like I've got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , Yeah . you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that <disfmarker> being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , Okay . you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . Mm . Mm . <vocalsound> Okay . Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus . Ooh , closing the meeting . Yeah . Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , That was quick . but the I think that's the industrial design is the first one , Mm . that's Kate , for the working design . Mm-hmm . And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . I think there's going to be a lot of <disfmarker> we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , <vocalsound> we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . Do you all agree ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Alright . Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . Okay . 'Kay . Thank you all .
It's Play-Doh . Play-Doh's edible . Did you know that ? It's definitely <disfmarker> Because kids <disfmarker> yeah . I used to eat it . I've , I've definitely eaten it before . I didn't know was edible . <vocalsound> <gap> . Yeah . But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , It's it's chew proof . <vocalsound> yeah . It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , normal babies . <vocalsound> Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the <gap> colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . Yeah . Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Right . Mm-hmm . Everybody everybody ready ? Yeah . Yep . Okay , let's have your um <disfmarker> let's get <gap> have the uh presentation ? We've got some <gap> . <vocalsound> We've got a cool prototype . Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So , everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , Double curved . <vocalsound> yeah , double curved , Nice . um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . <vocalsound> That is cool . So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , <vocalsound> the thumb button is the power button . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . What's the big blue thing ? That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it Oh cool . and then the M_ is a mute button . And then it also has digit <gap> what button ? Um . Oh mute . And mute . For muting the uh <disfmarker> Um and then then you can also <disfmarker> there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . <vocalsound> Okay . So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . That certainly does . <vocalsound> So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . Mm . So you don't you <disfmarker> Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ . Yeah . It should be . Mm . And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know Yeah . 'S great . change that . Oh it's so cute . So d does that uh what <disfmarker> mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . Ah , that's good thinking , yeah . Oh right , yeah . But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . Yeah . <gap> They make left-handed scissors , you know . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd <disfmarker> yeah , <gap> . Yeah , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? Yes s Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer <vocalsound> for the whole <disfmarker> the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . Mm . Sure . Sure . Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to <disfmarker> Uh-huh . I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so <disfmarker> Yeah . Imagine d are you right handed ? Yeah . Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too <disfmarker> Yeah , it's not <disfmarker> But we can have both uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Have them in stock . Yeah . Yeah . Make 'em more appealing as well . But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea . Do you think it says <vocalsound> R_R_ ? <gap> I think it does . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . Fashion to electronics . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> There you go . So that's that's <vocalsound> our end of things wha uh <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> Yeah , very good , yeah . It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've <disfmarker> what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , Yeah . <gap> all seems to be there . Well done . And all the playing around is uh <disfmarker> Um before we move on <disfmarker> Yeah , I'm just <disfmarker> do you wanna plug in ? I need that cable . Okay . Thank you . Yeah . Um . One thing I do need to do <disfmarker> we need to look at , is the costs . The costs , was that what you said ? Play-Doh is very cheap . <vocalsound> Well , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . <gap> um <disfmarker> Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it's edible . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Chew proof . <vocalsound> Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , <gap> . That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh right . <vocalsound> Okay , now I think we'll do this <disfmarker> Yeah . I could do <disfmarker> you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , Oh ho-ho . but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power . Yep . <vocalsound> And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . Ooh . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> the case , we've gone for the double curved . Um and it's made out of rubber . <vocalsound> The interface is push-buttons . And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? Yeah . So <gap> special colours . Yeah . It's better for <disfmarker> Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . Yeah , And special material . I mean , <vocalsound> these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so <disfmarker> Yep . Yeah . Um . Are they made out of any special material ? Rubber . No they're not . They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple <disfmarker> Well they're rubber , aren't they ? The buttons are rubber . Okay . Right . Yeah . So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . <gap> . That is gonna cost uh <disfmarker> We're under budget . Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . That's cool . Yeah . Yeah . So , And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased . <vocalsound> Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Save it in <gap> save it in the uh <vocalsound> my documents . It's already saved , I think . Splendid . Okay . So uh , that's <gap> done with this with this um doodah , so you're <gap> . Gonna do <disfmarker> what you were gonna do , Thank you . Mm . your evaluation . Oh , yeah . This is where we all get to <vocalsound> I get to write on the , oops , on the board . Right . <vocalsound> Oh . 'S function <disfmarker> F_ eight . Okay . <gap> I love the smell of that Play-Doh . <vocalsound> Yeah , Mm . <vocalsound> I cou <gap> . <vocalsound> have some have some . Okay . So , <vocalsound> evaluation . We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . I've got the criterias . And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's <disfmarker> fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so we have a box <disfmarker> <gap> . And this is false , this is just like to keep you informed . So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . <vocalsound> So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it <disfmarker> is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? So what mark should we give for that ? Mm . I would give it a seven . Yeah . As in it's not . Oh , sorry , one . <vocalsound> Oh sorry , one , d yeah . A one . A one a one . So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . Second criteria , new technology . Have we implemented new technology ? As in the new high-tech <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well , the kinetic thing , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . <gap> . So it's <gap> . So we'll give it a <disfmarker> Well so the um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's ergonomic , but that's not <disfmarker> that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . Yeah . Yeah . True . Yeah . So on the technical side of it it <disfmarker> I'd say it's about a a twoish ? It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , Two . Two . maybe , yeah , I dunno . Three . Yeah . Maybe three , yeah . <gap> three . So criteria three is is it easy to use ? Easy to use . I think it's a one , I think . I'd say it's I wouldn't <disfmarker> Yeah . not if you're left-handed it's not . I would give it a I would give it a two , Mm . Two , so it's <disfmarker> 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but <disfmarker> Okay . But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? Mm . If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Give it a t give it a two . Yeah , okay . <vocalsound> 'Kay , criteria four is costs . <gap> Cost . It's come in under budget . <vocalsound> 's great . Yeah . So that's a definite one . That was great . Yeah . Amount of buttons . Like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like a lot le like <disfmarker> Contains only the necessary buttons . So it's a one ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ? <vocalsound> Yes s yeah . Yes . Very good . So it's anti-R_S_I_ . It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? Is it easy to get lost ? It's yellow . <vocalsound> It is very bright , yeah . I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . <vocalsound> No ? But it is smallish . It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . Two . Maybe it will . Uh . T Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost . You think it could lost <disfmarker> <gap> two . Mm . Yeah . Mm . I mean it's not fully it's not fully <disfmarker> like you can't say <disfmarker> I mean it <disfmarker> No , I mean I mean , it's not a one , definitely . I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess . Yeah . But , yeah , it can get lost . The mobiles get lost all the time . Yeah . Okay , yeah , two is fine . But then you ring 'em and you find them . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah . So , that's that . So that's the evaluation , so I'd say <disfmarker> Yay . <vocalsound> We've , we've done well . Alright it's all all systems go . It's like <vocalsound> <gap> like a number one . Um . Yeah . Number one product . Mm . <vocalsound> We can't fail . All done , thanks . We fitted all the criterias . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> . Yeah , so <disfmarker> Well done , Reissa . So that's that one . Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , <vocalsound> you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . <vocalsound> That's all , you know , gone very very well Yeah . and and and be you know , has been good communication going on . <vocalsound> Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept <disfmarker> we tried to keep it cool and and <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> just just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and <disfmarker> Well . <vocalsound> You know <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Fantastic . Now you guys have been a a great team . It is <gap> . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , <gap> . <gap> been cool . I think <disfmarker> So <vocalsound> I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't <disfmarker> we're not just rehashing an old design . In four diff in in four meetings . Yeah . Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually <disfmarker> so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , <gap> they get <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . <vocalsound> They're using our ideas . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , <gap> two years' time this will be on the market . <vocalsound> Ex exactly that product <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um thum <disfmarker> we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But um <disfmarker> So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? Yeah . <gap> No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . <vocalsound> Y Oh really ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or six , uh <disfmarker> Just start summarising now . <vocalsound> You can reply to the same message . I haven't got message . See summary , there . If you just reply to that one . So there's no way to like predict what our <disfmarker> 'Cause we had a <disfmarker> we originally had a <vocalsound> <disfmarker> As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . It was fifty mil fifty million <disfmarker> Was it was it fifty or five ? I don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? It gets handed over to another department . Depends how much we sell . Uh . What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . Hmm . <gap> the for the <disfmarker> and just basically is it it come <disfmarker> can <disfmarker> is it within budget . When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments <disfmarker> it's another team that actually work out the mai the <disfmarker> But we have a vested interest <gap> oh yeah , prof profit sharing <vocalsound> . the <disfmarker> all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . <vocalsound> Um . Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made We finished an hour earlier . <vocalsound> we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's <disfmarker> does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um something that uh <vocalsound> that isn't out there already . I think actually <disfmarker> and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . Mm . We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , Definitely . it's <disfmarker> that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's <disfmarker> whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , Mm . Mm . so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new . Mm . It make watching T_V_ healthy . Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's fine , it's kid proof . Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them . Uh . Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . No <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . Mm yep . Well done everybody . Yay . Right , you too . Um . Drinks are on the company . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Cool . In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Glad to hear that . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's it . That's it . Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um . Yep . We haven't got the five minute left thing yet . No . Anyone wanna play I spy ? <vocalsound> Mm mm . <vocalsound> I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . Should we call the day then ? Yeah , I guess . I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire . Uh , right . Um . It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before . Mm-hmm . In <gap> project . But I'm not the authority to say that it is . Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? I love it . <vocalsound> I love it . <vocalsound> I think it's cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and <disfmarker> it's cool . <vocalsound> Being watched . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Your moment to shine . <vocalsound> Wow . <vocalsound> Yeah . I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not <disfmarker> never seen that before . <gap> something that t the whiteboard Yeah . thingy , <vocalsound> that's great . Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not <disfmarker> Yeah . it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text . Mm . Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Logitech . I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic . Yeah . So . Shall we <disfmarker> Meeting adjourned . Right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm . Okay . Good morning everybody . Um I'm glad you could all come . I'm really excited to start this team . Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . My name is Rose Lindgren . I I'll be the Project Manager . Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . First of all our project aim . Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three <vocalsound> compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating . Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . Um Alima , Alima . sorry <vocalsound> <vocalsound> , Alima . Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it . Okay . Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . Probably both . <vocalsound> Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . I have no drawing skills whatsoever . But uh let's see , introduce myself . My name is Alima Bucciantini . Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . I'm doing nationalism studies , blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents . How do you spell your name ? A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ . Thanks . Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . So let's see if I can get <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . And you have the pretty little shell going on . Some little eyes . Happy . There you go . That's a turtle . Yes . So what are your favourite characteristics ? Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . Mm . It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw . <vocalsound> Excellent . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Shall we just go around the table ? Uh Okay . Well , my name is Iain uh Mm . and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um . And I'll try and draw my favourite animal . <vocalsound> No , I'll <disfmarker> I should leave that one on there shouldn't I <vocalsound> you can erase the turtle , before I callously rub it off . it's alright . Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . <vocalsound> Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is that at least identifiable ? Snake . Well . It's a whale <vocalsound> , yes . Em Well , snake ? <vocalsound> It's w <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thanks . Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . <vocalsound> Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're <disfmarker> well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . And I just find them interesting animals . Take my contraptions with me . Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , <gap> animal . Don't really know how to draw this . Just where can I <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Maybe if I do the water , <vocalsound> but how ? Sort of give an idea . <vocalsound> I have no idea how one would explain this . Mm maybe with some whiskers . Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . <vocalsound> Mm 'kay . Mm 'kay ? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , <vocalsound> from California . Um . Hmm . <vocalsound> S <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . a cat . Yeah . Um it's actually a coyote . Let's see . Let's see , Right . <vocalsound> That's impressive . let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth . That's <disfmarker> Yeah . That's pretty impressive . Cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh dear . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . We have coyotes howl all the time . So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . Mm . <vocalsound> Okay um , moving on to slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple <vocalsound> we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such <disfmarker> this is for television it's a <disfmarker> we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could <disfmarker> I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you <disfmarker> what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so <disfmarker> Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . I just wanna watch the T_V_ <vocalsound> um . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Always gets lost . Some sort of like device to help you find it . I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . Mm . So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um . I find them <disfmarker> they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of <disfmarker> in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um . And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . Yeah um . I agree with having too many remotes around . My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um . What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . Yeah . Yeah . Um , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's <disfmarker> if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . So <disfmarker> What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? <vocalsound> Um I would imagine all of them , I know . but we could <disfmarker> but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . Yeah , something that doesn't <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um . Mm-hmm . Mm . Um . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . So how do we work with that ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . Could we get something that just has <disfmarker> No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for <disfmarker> that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , Mm-hmm . channel changing . And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , Yeah . then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the <disfmarker> whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , Mm . N that way <disfmarker> Yeah . 'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on . <vocalsound> Yeah , Mm . and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . Um . Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . Yeah . Mm . So like you have to have them somewhere , Yeah . 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . Right . Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only <vocalsound> Good question . um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? <vocalsound> I don't know that yet . Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? Mm . It's a good question . Um . <vocalsound> I'll look into that . Mm-hmm hmm . If I can . I think it's just T_V_ , <vocalsound> I mean , if it <disfmarker> if we're taking it just <gap> new product a new television remote control that's not like <vocalsound> doesn't say . Mm yeah . You know , things might be more advanced than that . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> So we should <disfmarker> maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . <vocalsound> Well , I mean I suppose it would be nice to have <vocalsound> playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not . Yes . I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . If it's just a television then that <disfmarker> it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . Yeah . It's an idea with the buttons being really <gap> . Large . Yeah . If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . Mm . Yeah . Okay . 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . Mind if we move on ? Ps <vocalsound> 'Kay . Mm-hmm . mm okay . Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um , Hmm . but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . Yeah . Um the User Interface Designer , that's for <gap> . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay um . And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . Um so very exited to see all your animals and how <disfmarker> what wonderful um artists we all are <vocalsound> um . <vocalsound> Any questions ? <vocalsound> What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? Do we know that ? I haven't gotten an agenda yet , um I'll put that together . I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction Right . and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . Yep . So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time 'Kay . Yep . I'm sure we'll be busy . <vocalsound> Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um . Okay . Can you e-mail your slides as well ? Is that possible ? Yes , I yes , I think I can . Mm-hmm . Cool I'll just attach it to an email . And you're you're number two , I'm two . three , four ? I'm four . Is that correct ? Okay . Alright . Excellent . It was lovely meeting you all . 'Kay Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Let me see if I can do that right now .
<gap> <gap> <vocalsound> I dunno . <vocalsound> Throwing away my toothpick . Hi there . Yo . Ow . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> 'Kay . Uh <disfmarker> Nice user interface . Yeah . What the <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah well , ja well let's just start . 'Kay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've uh made a presentation Right let's see it . uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it . So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here . Well <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very nice . Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . So uh <vocalsound> I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in , 'Kay . and uh hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh sorry . <vocalsound> And <gap> an uh a nice agenda . <vocalsound> Uh we'll do the opening and then uh we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction . <vocalsound> We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So <vocalsound> this the opening we'll uh <disfmarker> We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so . Mm-hmm . Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design . Uh trendy , it's <vocalsound> also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern . And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh <disfmarker> Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things . Mm-hmm . Other uh <disfmarker> There happen to be uh three stages . <gap> functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase . That's just it . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> We have uh these two Smartboards . Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh <vocalsound> Words Excel , everything . Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board . <gap> you have a <disfmarker> these different uh functions on the board . You can see them there . So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . <vocalsound> This is just a <gap> . I want to uh <disfmarker> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Of course w <vocalsound> doesn't work any more . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh <disfmarker> Does it ? Yeah . It works . Yes I will <disfmarker> eraser <gap> so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wonderful . It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away . Mm-hmm . Uh just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . <vocalsound> Just uh let them all uh stand here . We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well it's just like a normal uh paint . <vocalsound> So it's gone . <vocalsound> Alright , yep . Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself . We going to try it . So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> not my idea . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright , your favourite animal ? <vocalsound> Yes our your favourite . So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo , <vocalsound> but I'm going d I'm not going to . I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast <vocalsound> Grizzly bear . <vocalsound> w I dunno what I'm going to design . <vocalsound> Oh um <vocalsound> doesn't <disfmarker> oh . I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh <disfmarker> Yeah , 'kay . Hmm ? I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment . <vocalsound> I just said it's not my idea Yeah . <vocalsound> but I am the Project Manager , and officially this is my idea . I I I <vocalsound> I understand . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We're kinda losing time , though . Alright . what ? We're losing time , but <disfmarker> Ah <vocalsound> the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other <gap> so start <disfmarker> Alright . <gap> well uh uh nice yeah . <vocalsound> Sh <vocalsound> Yep yes . I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh <disfmarker> Don't uh count on it . No <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so a a few legs . Do we have to guess ? <vocalsound> Yes yes <vocalsound> A hippo ? <vocalsound> guess . <vocalsound> Well I should make it an hippo now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think it's a mouse or a rat . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No I don't think so . <vocalsound> Oh . Oh I know it . Well what is it , huh ? It's a hedgehog . I don't know how to call it . Yeah A hedgehog ? <vocalsound> <gap> difficult English word . I didn't knew it myself <gap> . <vocalsound> <gap> . Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Our characteristics sum it up . Well it's uh very <vocalsound> uh painful <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> those kind of thing . <vocalsound> So we can uh just uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We're going back <vocalsound> and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . <vocalsound> I am the Industrial Designer . Alright . Thank you . Huh . Chief , I am the Industrial Designer . Oh uh but this uh marketing designer . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> It's pr it resembles <vocalsound> the animal drawn by <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> It's <gap> . <vocalsound> what kind of animal is that then ? <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> can I say it ? Yeah sure . Uh it <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a rabbit . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Looks very nice , right ? Yeah . It looks amazing . No no no . What are you going to do ? <vocalsound> We want to erase it . <vocalsound> No no . <vocalsound> No no save it and start a new uh <disfmarker> save it Yes . These are very impor <vocalsound> and start a new black uh doc <gap> a blank document . These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh <disfmarker> Yeah well we have to save everything Yes uh right . so now um the next one uh <disfmarker> <gap> and then save it and start an blank document . You go man . <vocalsound> Thanks . <vocalsound> Yeah . There's also different colours and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . So um well you should uh try it but uh <disfmarker> Alright . I should have made mine a white rabbit . <vocalsound> Well y y y you could have but uh <vocalsound> . And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for . <vocalsound> It speaks for itself . <vocalsound> What the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It looks like an uh <disfmarker> uh just a duck . <vocalsound> It looks like that beast from Sesame Street . <vocalsound> Nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . Yeah . Big bird . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is it a duck ? You're standing in front of it , It's it's uh <disfmarker> I can't see it . Is it a plane ? <vocalsound> Alright , thank you . Yeah it's a bird , but what kind of bird ? <vocalsound> It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh . Do we have to uh <disfmarker> You have to push harder . Yeah Mm . just a bit a bit childish , a bit <vocalsound> . But we have uh <vocalsound> do we have to name the specific species of the bird ? Release your anger . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh no I don't . No ? It's just a bird . Well wonderful . Well uh save the document and then uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then a a new blank document for <gap> . <gap> uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . Here you go . <vocalsound> Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ? Uh pen <disfmarker> No well first yeah . yeah that's <gap> . And then you go to format I think <vocalsound> , Uh current colour . and current colour <gap> you choose a new colour . <vocalsound> And a new pen width uh <gap> also format . I like uh <disfmarker> Mm . oh they don't have pink . <vocalsound> Oh b oh <vocalsound> think this is uh <disfmarker> It's not like in paint . Uh ? Uh <disfmarker> Line width . And you can choose a nice one . Line width . Width . Width width . Uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> fifteen . With each other . <vocalsound> And I can draw ? Hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> So . Just a wa that's the way we do <gap> Uh <disfmarker> it's quite easy . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> It's a pussy cat . It's a cat . <vocalsound> Oh Pussy . <vocalsound> Oh the line width is too thick , but oh well . Well then you change it . And erase things . Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a pig . <vocalsound> It smiles nicely . Super pig . <vocalsound> Now <vocalsound> I have to change the line width . <vocalsound> Uh one <vocalsound> <gap> . So <disfmarker> These are <gap> whiskers , you know . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah Right . we know . <vocalsound> Uh well I think it's obvious right now . Yes alright . It's a cat . <vocalsound> No it looks great . Miaow . <vocalsound> Well if this isn't obvious <disfmarker> Well well um <disfmarker> Just save it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'll save it <vocalsound> alright uh save . Yeah <vocalsound> save it <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> start a new blank document . Uh yeah uh blank . Yep . So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it . Well I feel comfortable now . Oh great . Well <vocalsound> it's terrific , eh ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thanks for this exercise . It's good for group spirit . <vocalsound> I feel totally at ease . Yeah that's it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It certainly is . <vocalsound> We're one big happy family now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah something like that . Well then uh the serious uh stuff . We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . So <disfmarker> So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . Right . Alright . Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first <gap> about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? Right . Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes <vocalsound> and uh <disfmarker> Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh <disfmarker> <gap> Please ? <vocalsound> No uh I did . <vocalsound> it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh <disfmarker> Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then <disfmarker> I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . Yeah . Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . Yeah yeah . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Yep . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player That's alright . That would be a nice idea , yes . so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . Yep yep yep . Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to <gap> well fifty million ? Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . Mm-hmm . Yeah yeah <vocalsound> so a lot of people have to be able to use it . No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh So <disfmarker> Easy to learn . Yeah . Yeah that's right . Yeah . Yes . and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . Yeah . I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh <disfmarker> well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . Mm-hmm . Alright . I also think we should not add too many buttons . Right . Modern day uh remotes have <vocalsound> too much buttons I think . No that's right . Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's <gap> Precisely . culture uh international . Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ Yeah . and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . Yeah indeed . Yes . Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh <disfmarker> Yeah right . Yep , and maybe we do uh <vocalsound> we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? And stereo uh s uh audio installations . Uh . We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw . Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . Yeah . Yeah . Yep . And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind . Most people do , yeah . Well yeah . It doesn't <gap> it doesn't have to be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It doesn't have to be , but we can . W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it . Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . Yeah but <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah alright , but <disfmarker> We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh <disfmarker> Yeah Well . because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design <disfmarker> Hmm . Yeah but it's <disfmarker> it has to be useable . It has to be different and familiar at the same time . Yes . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . Yep . <gap> yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing <gap> Yeah . you can make it uh triangle shaped , <vocalsound> No . but that's not uh very recognisable . Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and <disfmarker> Oo Oval ? N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . I <disfmarker> Yeah or so So <vocalsound> one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Well yeah it's new . <vocalsound> <gap> . Not with two hands . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah , right . No <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> but young people want something different and it is <disfmarker> Well i we already uh <disfmarker> Yeah but it's quite important that it fits . one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another <disfmarker> Yeah alright . Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to <disfmarker> we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have <vocalsound> been uh tested out so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful Yes . or else uh they would have been ano another shape . Well <vocalsound> for me personally I have a <vocalsound> a lot of remotes uh at home but <vocalsound> those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle <vocalsound> I don't like to use them . I have uh have to <disfmarker> it has to fit my hands . Yeah . Yeah . When it falls over it and I just have <disfmarker> and then the button that I use most has to be here . It shouldn't be boxy . Yeah . Yeah a lo <gap> the long box shape yeah . You have to <vocalsound> use one hand . It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with <gap> thumb . Nah <disfmarker> I don't agree with the long box uh shape <vocalsound> it it has to be custom made for the hand . Why not ? Yeah it doesn't fit <gap> . Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . Yeah . But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , Yeah but if you shape it <disfmarker> but then you have <disfmarker> No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ <gap> with their uh remotes <vocalsound> pl players <vocalsound> they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . If <disfmarker> <vocalsound> D_V_D_ players . Yes . <vocalsound> W no w what else ? No that's ol old fashioned . I di Well <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? I can imagine that us Yes uh <disfmarker> Well <vocalsound> most of <gap> of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . Yeah right . It fits in your palms . Hmm . Well <vocalsound> Mm . but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh <vocalsound> round forms in it to fit your hand , Yeah it <disfmarker> Hmm ? Well <disfmarker> A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . Um . but it's it's still <disfmarker> Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still <gap> sort of box , yeah . That's <disfmarker> <gap> . It it has round forms <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> Yeah yea but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean . Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . Yeah yeah I understand , It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . but <disfmarker> no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square It's <disfmarker> Hmm . <vocalsound> No no no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but a also with round edges of course , <gap> . but in in in at the end it's still this long <vocalsound> box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh <vocalsound> to fit . Yeah . <vocalsound> Right maybe something like this Yeah yes <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and then a button here to switch between <vocalsound> different systems like D_V_D_ player I thought about something like that . Yeah . and so you can <disfmarker> I've <disfmarker> A big recognisable button on top or something . Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . We have five minutes left . The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , Right . <vocalsound> and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . Yes uh that's <vocalsound> yep . But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . Yep . So there has to be some space between the buttons . Uh-huh . Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . Yeah . Yeah right right , <vocalsound> Yeah . and maybe we should use colours . Colours , yeah . Yeah <gap> maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well <gap> <vocalsound> you can you can put on on them , Yeah . Ha . and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs <vocalsound> That's kinda trendy . Yeah right . I dunno but <disfmarker> Sound nice . Yes . I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well it's just uh about our first ideas now <gap> . so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Right . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , Already thought about something tha <vocalsound> Yes ? Yes . so we <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well thirty minutes we have . Mm-hmm . So um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think . Yeah . <gap> . <vocalsound> No problem . Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah now we can still talk about the material , Yeah yes say . we have some some minutes left uh <gap> Mm . I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , Yeah . the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh . Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy . <gap> . No n n <gap> . Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . Yeah that's bad , yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . So it has to be made in the buttons I think . It has to uh not be loose . Yeah that's important <gap> . Mm . Alright . And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh <vocalsound> to connect things uh to each other . Yeah . Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh <disfmarker> Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah . I think so . It's a a common stan standard way <gap> It's not that in China it's different ? Yep . infrared beams an infrared beam I think <gap> . Yeah . But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between <disfmarker> And you can use <disfmarker> It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Probably yes . <vocalsound> China rules . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And have <disfmarker> well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . <vocalsound> The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , <vocalsound> But are <disfmarker> but that's pretty obvious , I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . I think <vocalsound> we should make it universal Yeah . and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it <vocalsound> just plain Yes . but you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> To make it more trendy . <gap> . Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the <disfmarker> Yeah . Right . Yes . Yes . Right . And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well you can make profit with them , and it's <vocalsound> a way to make them trendy . Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself <vocalsound> so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh . Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something Yeah right . Yeah alright <vocalsound> . Yeah normal . uh b a simple colour not not very flashy . Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , No a colour everyone accepts . so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so <disfmarker> Mm . Pink television sets <vocalsound> pink remote , <gap> . Mm . Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . <gap> standard . But people of often don't like bright colours or something . <gap> . We have to make it grey or s or black . Well young people s li Yeah but then you can use <vocalsound> a a front . Yeah yeah , yeah . Alright . Yeah . I must not forget my pen the next time . <vocalsound> Well if if you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . Yeah . Yeah that's right . I think . Yeah or a t Teletubby front . <vocalsound> But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate . Yes . <vocalsound> Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh <gap> I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think . Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah . Or something like that . Yeah . Yeah . Right . What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't get <disfmarker> Yeah I uh w was wondering that too . Y you went to the company website <gap> . Euro ? It's <disfmarker> Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer <disfmarker> Well it it it's <vocalsound> Yeah . if you uh <disfmarker> It's the the the start uh starting page uh <disfmarker> Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it <gap> . Yeah . Finish meeting now . <vocalsound> Oh alright . <vocalsound> Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so <disfmarker> Yes . Well that's great . Next meeting is in <disfmarker> In thirty minutes , Thirty minutes . Thirty minutes . but uh I think it will be <disfmarker> you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here . Yeah alright it's it's handy to know <gap> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh <vocalsound> Very handy to know . <vocalsound> It's totally broken . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> because uh <vocalsound> it's it's the half of the normal size . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right see you in half an hour then . Oh right , oh . Oh . <vocalsound> Goodbye . <vocalsound> W <vocalsound> Ma <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> S W <vocalsound> that was a nice meeting . <vocalsound> <gap> . <gap> . Right uh see you in thirty minutes then . <vocalsound> Yeah , see you . <vocalsound>
Good morning , again . One question . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Send . Choose a number ? <vocalsound> Submit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yep yep yep yep . All set ? Mm . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Good . Okay . Let's see what we can find here . Okay . A very warm welcome again to everyone . <vocalsound> Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . Um and this is what we are going to do . The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting . <vocalsound> And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Yes . Good . And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . But I think we will need it . Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah . Yeah . Well . You can go first , okay . Well , shall I go first with the users ? Well <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> well okay no problem . <vocalsound> Is there an order ? everybody already has his presentation , I haven't <disfmarker> Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies <vocalsound> so you can adjust it . <vocalsound> So . Huh ? Okay , um <disfmarker> And one question , uh your name Denni , is it with a E_I_E_ . I_E_ <disfmarker> E_I_E_ , okay . <vocalsound> Thank you . Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . Um <vocalsound> well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . Uh when you press a button , <vocalsound> uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh <vocalsound> button just presses on a <gap> Sorry . <vocalsound> on a little print plate <vocalsound> uh which uh makes uh uh <vocalsound> a connection that uh gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled <vocalsound> to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . You know what a let is ? Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . That's basically uh how it works . Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh <vocalsound> and chips . <vocalsound> Uh and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . Uh I made a little uh uh animation of <vocalsound> about how a tran our uh remote controller works . <vocalsound> <gap> Oh right . <vocalsound> Animation . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we tel There is something turning . There . Yeah , it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Uh well <vocalsound> the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh li uh a d ad uh electronic uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Infrared light . Yes , uh , okay . Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . Okay . S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . <vocalsound> Yeah , I've got it there too . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , <vocalsound> uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh To this meeting . <vocalsound> Okay , <vocalsound> two of these this meeting . So . thank you . Shall I go uh next ? Yep . 'Kay . Please . So . <vocalsound> Smoking . Well uh , my name's <gap> , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found . Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there . Um <vocalsound> I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it <disfmarker> I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . And that is my presentation . Okay , Okay . <vocalsound> thank you . 'Kay . Check . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You must still have it open . Kijke <gap> 'Kay , so . <vocalsound> We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just <disfmarker> Yeah , and the users , actually . <vocalsound> The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then <disfmarker> tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . <gap> Goed so . Hmm . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . <vocalsound> So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , <vocalsound> Yeah . but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . <vocalsound> Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , Mm . and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . Next . Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those <disfmarker> they <disfmarker> those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . It has also be <disfmarker> have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off Mm . Hmm . or would be s uh <gap> senden <gap> <vocalsound> okay . <vocalsound> So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ? Yeah , touch screen , yeah . Okay . The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . Mm . 'Kay . So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot <disfmarker> not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use <vocalsound> because you have <disfmarker> you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . And that is it . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay , Oh right . <vocalsound> thank you . Um , well thank you all , huh . <vocalsound> No . Res I did not . <vocalsound> I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? No ? Well , No . Perhaps the rest ? then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them Ja , <gap> so you can all read them . Oh , well not in this presentation . Hmm <vocalsound> Should be in there . Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . Um teletext does <disfmarker> has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . Oh . Mm . <vocalsound> So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ? Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? Be television . Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ? Yeah . Only be used for television . Yeah . And the video also , or not uh ? <vocalsound> Only the television . Well it says only for television here , huh . Oh . Alright . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Makes it a lot easier , huh ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . So yeah , then you can yeah . Requirements , no ? Functions . Mm-hmm . Then it should have uh on , off , Yeah for <disfmarker> Yeah , Standby options , and uh <disfmarker> the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , yeah ? Uh yeah . Yeah . And per perhaps uh <disfmarker> oh teletext doesn't have to be ? No . Um other functions . Well uh uh yes yes s sh <vocalsound> Yeah A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . I had <disfmarker> Two s two Yeah , yeah . two digits , oh okay . Can you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Don't know if that's got a name , Yeah I understand what you mean . Yeah . I think it's but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , It makes it twelve , yeah . Yeah . and that's that's not relaxed Indeed . Okay . S Well , not really <vocalsound> to user . And and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . <vocalsound> Yeah . So d uh wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve . So that it <vocalsound> easy and fast . Yeah . But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , so you should have that one on . Uh yeah , think so . Our main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus , or ? Mute misschien also . Mm . Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus . Forties , okay because <vocalsound> because younger people as Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so I think to um <disfmarker> Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh <disfmarker> for fingerprint , Yeah , we we could yeah . and then you can use it again . But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . Yeah , okay . Yeah but a <disfmarker> you don't know <disfmarker> A touch screen uh probably uh even more . An So , True . true , true . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But uh <disfmarker> Well um is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen uh , how was the information ? Yeah , it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen . Because , yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . So <vocalsound> And if the only f perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , because our target is sixteen to forty five . But , Yeah but uh will we not uh exceed our uh our uh production uh <disfmarker> do you <disfmarker> Yeah you don't know how much it costs . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . Is it possible to find out , anyway ? No , I don't have any costs here , You know ? I only have percentages . But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . No , an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . Um just uh displays several buttons , Yeah ? for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen Oh right , and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen . so you can <disfmarker> Oh , yeah alright . So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen . Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah . and you get the buttons for audio settings , Yeah yeah . Yeah alright , oh right . so the other buttons are gone . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? Yeah . I think it's the most easier thing , Would be yeah . That's my uh <disfmarker> yeah . And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive . <vocalsound> No . Yeah . Well we had twelve fifty , I guess , for uh production ? Yeah . Twelve fifty . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . Any guesses ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I suppose wi if the mar if our um <vocalsound> if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em . Highly . Mm-hmm . And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls <disfmarker> Yeah . But <disfmarker> But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , Yeah , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? but <disfmarker> Um , s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . Oh , so still a little bit people <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah that's right . But you don't want to alienate the other uh <disfmarker> No , that not now , but , so <disfmarker> But if they also buy it then it's alright . I guess . Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . Yeah . Yeah . Alright . Okay , so An L_C_D_ it is ? Yes . Mm . It's treasure . Okay . And what else ? I hope we uh h and Yeah , let's hope to reach those uh those sales . i i if it <disfmarker> Yeah , if it costs <disfmarker> gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens . N Yeah . <vocalsound> nothing , no costs at all . Uh so if you uh <disfmarker> But perhaps later , Yeah , so so uh <disfmarker> if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the <disfmarker> Yeah , or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder . in <disfmarker> I think that should Yeah . yeah <disfmarker> I think we all get the costs of everything . I don't <disfmarker> Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert . Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it . I uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh <vocalsound> too expensive . Yeah sure , sure . Yeah . Yeah , okay . But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . Yeah . Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly . <vocalsound> The L_C_D_ ? Yeah , Oh that's a bit of a problem . <vocalsound> and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . Oh , that's a bit of a problem . Mm . Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It's looks fancy one yeah , of L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , but they don't they don't like it . Yeah . They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , just a <disfmarker> the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes . Oh , alright , I thought that you said that . So <disfmarker> Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , Yeah . because it's new , as far as I know . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah , of course . Mm yeah . <vocalsound> And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , And then not <disfmarker> yeah . but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . Um . Yeah . Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . Yeah . Mm . Okay ? Okay , what else does our remote need ? Um <disfmarker> A mute button . Mute button . Mm-hmm . I think . <vocalsound> The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , And <disfmarker> Yeah . and power s power usage . Yeah . And a teletext , but that is not of the question . But <disfmarker> Other things are <disfmarker> But shouldn't you put a button of <disfmarker> for teletext on the <disfmarker> for the people who want to use it ? Sorry ? Yeah , it could be . Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext . Yeah , teletext . Yeah . Yeah . And there's also a <disfmarker> And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , Yeah , they are less important , but I think they should be there , Less important . Yeah , or not ? should be there , but not press <disfmarker> A sh but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . Yeah , sub-menu , yeah . Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh , to not use batteries , and use ac uh bat uh <gap> batteries to uh to be <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah . yeah yeah sure . Indeed . So uh you can mount uh the the the uh Yeah , in a breath it's <disfmarker> uh the remote control to um Mm-hmm . Charted . We should think of the twelve fifty we have to refill the <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> Yeah , but we don't we don't have any costs now , I don't know how much that's going to uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , so <disfmarker> Yeah . because i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries , Yeah . the batteries will be uh empty very soon , very fast . Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things . You should <disfmarker> Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . Yeah . If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Uh <disfmarker> I don't know . Yeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , Nee that's that's so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . uh yeah . But then you can't <disfmarker> And go to standby mode when you don't use it , Yeah . Yeah . so that <disfmarker> Yeah yeah au automac matically , that it <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , automatically . Yeah . After two minutes or three minutes , something like that . After two minutes , yeah two three minutes , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen . Yeah . Sure . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then b that uh <vocalsound> before an hour when its get again gets empty . Yeah . Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . Charger . Mm . <vocalsound> So we are going for the for the recharger . Yeah . Yeah , Okay . if it's <gap> . Uh . If it's sensible . <vocalsound> Yeah , because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger , Yeah . Yeah , and I don't think it <disfmarker> b when the batteries are low <disfmarker> No , when you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television , you have to put it <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go <vocalsound> hours , six hours , five , six hours , then . Yeah sure , of course . But you'll also forget to put it in , Yeah , then you have a problem . because you throw it on the couch Yeah , but <disfmarker> and you don't remember . But you also forget to buy batteries , Yeah . That's right . and then you can you can't use it , so I <disfmarker> Yeah . Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged . Yeah . So . Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , Yeah because you have b or not ? but you have L_C_D_ screen . 'Cause <disfmarker> Yeah , that's right , High power usage . but <disfmarker> High power user cell , i uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , Yes . that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions . True . Yeah . Yeah . True . Yeah . Right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , you made a point there . <vocalsound> But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch Yeah , also . because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . Yeah , otherwise all your <disfmarker> yeah . Just a small device <vocalsound> . Yeah . Yeah it hasn't <disfmarker> Plug it in , that's it . I think everything has it for and <disfmarker> I guess . It doesn't have to be big . Yeah , like a <disfmarker> like telephone charger or something . Yeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , Yeah . Yeah . just u Yeah . Okay . Alright . Okay , well It has to be easy to use also , or things . Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition . I've Yeah , you have some more <vocalsound> points . I think . Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points Also . uh , or <disfmarker> Well I think that this should be standard . Large button <disfmarker> large buttons . Yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify . Yeah ? Okay . Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> . And you said something about speech recognition ? <vocalsound> Yeah , it says also <disfmarker> Speech recognition ? Yeah . Hello . Twelve Euro <vocalsound> Yeah , twelve Euro fifty . Twelve . That's an <disfmarker> twelve fifty , twelve fifty . <vocalsound> also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . So it's pretty big . Well , spread it by a big market . But then I I I <disfmarker> Even bigger than for L_C_D_ . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Well Yeah . <vocalsound> W I know let's do a speech . <vocalsound> let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a <vocalsound> microphone on top of the television to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Ninety . Twenty five . You can clap or something . <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> channel . Turn volume up . Yeah . Hey , that that's an idea . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno <vocalsound> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , well that should <disfmarker> it has to be remote control , not <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah . <gap> twelve . But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , Yeah . Sure why not why not <vocalsound> or ? <vocalsound> Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . It's the only thing it says . Yeah , mm . Oh , but do we want to implement that , or ? <vocalsound> I think an L_C_D_ screen <vocalsound> should be suf sufficient . Yeah . But when you look at the percentages <disfmarker> Yeah , it says a lot , but <disfmarker> Perhaps the options should be uh <disfmarker> Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ? Why not ? <vocalsound> Yeah , well , Why not ? maybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . Yeah . Let's hope uh to have some uh d I know <vocalsound> No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . Mm . But would it be useful to imple implement both ? Yeah , if the costs al allow it . <vocalsound> On one remote ? Well <disfmarker> Or <disfmarker> Yeah , I dunno . I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . Nee . With that uh <disfmarker> If it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . Yeah . Yeah , We should do it . Yeah . Sure . but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , Yeah . Yeah . or ? Uh . Certain systems already exist , I think . Mm-hmm . Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . Then uh it's y <vocalsound> it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English <vocalsound> True . True , yeah . Yeah . True . Yeah . But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . This should be uh accommodated with some software , uh , uh . Yeah . Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than um Swahili or something . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . Right . Swahili . Swahili . Yeah you can use icons for the Yeah . Ja , well possible . a speaker and uh <disfmarker> Indeed . But if that's better than language for the for the remote . Yeah , yeah yeah yeah <vocalsound> Yeah . So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay . Then it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . 'Kay , what else ? So , no speech recognition ? Or <disfmarker> Well , <gap> <vocalsound> if it could be done , we <disfmarker> Yeah , we have to keep <disfmarker> Yeah . Y it should be done . If it could be done , should be done . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , and then we have different languages . Yeah , that should be uh anything matters . That's not so difficult at all , Okay , because I already use on several voice operated systems , just make a separate remote for each uh <disfmarker> and they are all possible to uh not all , but <disfmarker> Well , you sh you should to adjust the thing . I think it's difficult . Every language of dialects <disfmarker> Yeah . I think it's very differen difficult . And you have to speak the <disfmarker> so that it can understand . Yeah . I think it can't be implemented , but maybe <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something . <vocalsound> Yeah , 's an option , yes . Yeah , sure , indeed . Fifty Euro cents . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Let's do speech . Yeah . For speech recognition . Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um <disfmarker> or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . Mm . And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons Mm , yes . Yeah . I <vocalsound> in general . With uh teletext if <disfmarker> it wasn't ver very important , No , it was but <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> You also now have colours . I don't know if we should implement that . Curved ? Yeah , when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the <disfmarker> Uh yeah . I don't know if we should implement that , Um . because it says that teletext not really important , S Shortcuts . Uh . but yeah , the shortcut , I think we should <disfmarker> we could that <disfmarker> and you can't go to sport . we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . Yeah . Mm . D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . Sh Yeah , It should be available just just sub-menu . Yeah . but not 'Cause it should be there . Not directly uh available . not <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , and <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there . Yeah , but s Directly available . Yeah . So does it confuse uh the user ? You'll have to search for it . <vocalsound> They'd have to be easy to use . Uh . I'll search um . <vocalsound> If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available . Yeah . Yeah , that's a <disfmarker> The sign of it . Okay , but no more buttons or functions , or ? Uh , No . I guess not . no . What else can you do with a television ? We've got anon Aren't we forgetting something very important ? Have got got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing . Uh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there . Well , we don't have the video orders <vocalsound> Yes , so this is your presentation . We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . Yeah , you could look here all the the <disfmarker> Which ones were yours ? Uh th th th th I don't know , technical functions . Techni <vocalsound> They're a bit small , you can <disfmarker> we should stretch them , because <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Ping . Ja ja ja ja ja . Technical functions . Yeah okay . I guess we've got them all . Uh I think I go to have volume , mute but I <disfmarker> Yeah <gap> . Very slow . Yeah , the zoom buttons . And for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ? Yeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have , Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and <disfmarker> yeah different uh <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . But that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing . Menu . Yeah it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . Yeah , Mm . so we should also implement se screen settings . Yeah , screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have . Oh right . Yeah . Channel settings . Yeah , so you can program the <disfmarker> So those four , and of course the main . Yeah , so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can uh go to uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Like tap screens or something Yeah . or , I dunno . <vocalsound> I hope we can do this . <vocalsound> Something <disfmarker> There are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got . Yeah , if uh <disfmarker> 'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings No , you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't <disfmarker> uh for uh <disfmarker> then you don't use it . Yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations Mm-hmm . We don't have to use that top . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So you leave it alone . Yeah . Yeah . Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . <vocalsound> Yeah . And do we want them in different colours , Yeah . or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And Colours . Yeah . and the buttons , should they have colours ? Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . Oh but we don't have any buttons . Yeah . I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g Yeah . Yeah , then defines itself . Because uh how many percent ? Eighty percent ? They think it's ugly , Would spend more money if it looks fancy . right ? Okay , so use uh very uh lot of peo <vocalsound> Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones <vocalsound> . Adjust with phones , yes <vocalsound> You can uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But I don't think that uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Twelve Euro fifty . Well , make it available in different colours , you mean ? Sure . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Red , white , blue , black . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Rasta colours . And a see-through uh Grey . Yeah sea view , yes , Simpson's versions and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , see through version . Yeah . If you press a button , it turns green . Yeah . Okay , well Leave . <vocalsound> A disco version . that's the Five minutes ? signal for las final five minutes . Um so I have uh the things I just read . Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ? Yeah . Channel settings ? Oh yeah , right . Channel settings . So you can program the T_V_ . Yeah . Okay . Mm . Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . So , options , and then you sub them . Yeah . Could be possible . Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , Mm . but <disfmarker> Or like uh you have a menu button , you press <disfmarker> No , we said teletext also a separate menu . Yeah , or otherwise you have a menu button , Yeah , but I <disfmarker> press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , But <disfmarker> but we can work that out later , I guess . Yeah , no problem . Yep . So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like uh large icons or small icons I don't know . and Um , I don't know what else , No . but <disfmarker> I think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , I think the buttons <disfmarker> Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . Yeah , but but or like you have Which one ? you only have channel button or volume button . Those buttons you can you can <disfmarker> But that's also in the L_C_D_ , Yeah , but on the L_C_D_ , huh ? right ? Yeah . Right , yeah , okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , So we don't have any normal buttons th No , no normal buttons , yeah . that uh <disfmarker> No , alright . Maybe only the on and o on and off button . Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno But we don't need a special <disfmarker> Uh not button <vocalsound> But I don't think <disfmarker> we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself . Mm , No , no . no . Okay . Oh well , you should be able to set which T_V_ you have . If you have <disfmarker> if you have uh <disfmarker> Yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control . Yeah . But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , No no no , that you don't have to use a <disfmarker> because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is <disfmarker> it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically . Yeah but but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , that you use <disfmarker> Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the <disfmarker> I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , No . yeah . Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote , No you just tap I think . Yeah , you tap . Just tap it . huh ? Touch screen , Tap the thing . Okay . yeah then it's turn <disfmarker> turn off , turn on . And then the television is on also , or just the remote ? No , just the remote . A television don't have to be on , But <disfmarker> that one you can <vocalsound> press on , Yeah , it should be in standby mode , yeah stand-by , but <disfmarker> then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . Or not . Yeah a yeah . I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_ , Separate . so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . Otherwise you <disfmarker> I don't know whether or not that's <disfmarker> A A A normal button on the remote control , Yeah , yeah . or norm ? To turn it on . Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . Yeah , I have , yeah . Okay , well <disfmarker> Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button ? Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want . Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button . Mm . Oh right . I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . Yeah , I think so too . Otherwise y wet e k Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> If we can afford it . <vocalsound> Okay , well <vocalsound> Yeah , if we can afford it . Yeah . <vocalsound> I guess we have to <vocalsound> Oh , okay <gap> postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . Um for now , we're having a lunch break , Oh . <vocalsound> and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this . <vocalsound> And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . Mm . And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach . Alright . Luckily as we are . <vocalsound> Okay , well thank you very much , for now , Mm-hmm . and uh have a nice lunch , huh ? <vocalsound> Lunch . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Food . <vocalsound> Should we put this back in our rooms , or uh ? Yeah , think so . Yeah .
Okay . Okay , almost there . Okay . We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint , I guess . How was that , was that fun ? Mm . Very fun . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do . Okay . <vocalsound> Upsidaisy . Hmm . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we <disfmarker> E excuse me I forgot my Yeah . Alright , okay , yeah . copy . <gap> <vocalsound> He's gonna get his pen . Oh right . Okay . Um <vocalsound> Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ? Yeah , there's good news ? Uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Mm . we have budget problems . Oh . Cutbacks . I'm afraid you're all sacked . Oops . <vocalsound> I don't even have this on . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? Okay . No , not mine yet . No . Okay so it's just your your show . Oh . Um maybe we should bring <gap> so that the camera can see <gap> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Sure . <vocalsound> Okay . We made three for you . Three ? Oh . Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st Tomato ? What tomato ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't recall a tomato . <vocalsound> Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . So . Okay , Ah I see , okay . <vocalsound> so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , Mm-hmm . mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um Logo . the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , Okay , brilliant . it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , Okay . um but mainly it's speech recognition . Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah and <vocalsound> yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . Alright , okay . Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . Right . <vocalsound> Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . That's groovy . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . Uh can I have <gap> Yeah , sure . Um that one is <disfmarker> Oh sorry s <vocalsound> Oh no , it's delicate . At Oh dear . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . Alright , okay . It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Okay , brilliant mm . Um the black on the back is the slogan . Okay , nice and obvious there <vocalsound> , Uh yeah , that <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , we did think of that . if it's standing up , I guess , yeah . Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can <disfmarker> you all can hold it , is <disfmarker> it does actually feel quite ergonomic , Mm-hmm . if you've got small hands . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized <gap> . Okay . It would have to be a bit bigger . Yeah , okay . Yeah , scale model , yeah . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . Mm-hmm . Um and <vocalsound> um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . <vocalsound> Alright , excellent . <vocalsound> We used those <gap> . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . It's not in the traditional place , Okay . No . but um it's quite an obvious place . It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . Excellent . So <vocalsound> there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too . Oh yeah , yeah . Yep . <vocalsound> This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences . <vocalsound> Okay A a more friendly type of <disfmarker> , <vocalsound> so so Barney the banana <gap> . Right , right . It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or <disfmarker> Ah excellent , just what we need . Yeah . Yeah . Say it for the camera . <vocalsound> Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Right , right . Cool <gap> yeah . Well , nice to have uh options at least . Yeah . Yep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So are there any um improvements or issues or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'Kay and <disfmarker> It won't stand . Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . <vocalsound> Just let it lie down , it wont stand . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . <vocalsound> Oh . Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . Mm . Oh . So we have to What's on the uh on the left ? <gap> rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow <disfmarker> Um . <vocalsound> There we go . Okay . Oh god , Ooh . why is it doing that ? There we go . <vocalsound> So basically , um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . Mm-hmm . More like a traditional remote control . Um . Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , Mm-hmm . so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . Mm-hmm . And by doing so <disfmarker> Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much . I don't know what's going on with this again . W why is the uh double curved two of them ? Oh , good point . And double curve on both sides ? Um . Curve <vocalsound> . Yeah , this is double-curve , That's <vocalsound> sort of curve in and out . no ? This is double-curve . Is i It <disfmarker> This one is single curve . Mm . 'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . So double-curve . No , I think it means double curved as in um Like an S_ shape . like uh <gap> a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . Okay . Okay , I might be wrong though . Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . Hmm . Hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> A curvature is like the <disfmarker> this case . Maybe . <vocalsound> 'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . Okay . Yeah , <gap> got two of them <disfmarker> and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however . Okay . Well we can work around that <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Right . No . <vocalsound> Cut things out . But you think it should be one . It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , Okay . but um <disfmarker> Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again . No maybe the shift button's stuck in . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us <disfmarker> Mm . Should <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh that's fine . Yeah , so we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty . Cool . Cool . Um <vocalsound> So we could even add something . We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . We should fire the accountants . What ? Fire the accountants . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah yeah , we could add things . <vocalsound> Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . Yeah . Does that work ? Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . No mm <vocalsound> . Uh you can do one thing <gap> . I don't know . You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this <disfmarker> Okay . It <disfmarker> One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know <gap> . <vocalsound> Just uh just uh <disfmarker> Okay , just a minute . Okay . No input , like this . <vocalsound> Shift . No it's not . No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . Yeah , it's not working . Is it the other shift button maybe ? Should we ask Meli <vocalsound> Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? <vocalsound> No that's fine . Um we've worked out what it would be anyway . <vocalsound> Did you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side . Yeah . <vocalsound> Cancel . Piss off . That's too bad . Oh well , never mind . Um <vocalsound> . Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we <disfmarker> what could we reckon we could add ? Um Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if <disfmarker> What do you th Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So <disfmarker> We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . Yeah . But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe <disfmarker> I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now . Yeah yeah . Well that's that's uh <disfmarker> Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve <vocalsound> Euros fifty . Project process , how do we think that went ? Are we happy ? Oh . Mm . Yeah I think we have a a winning product . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Evaluation . Oh we've been writing this up for m months . I think it went quite smoothly . Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? W I think we were very creative . <vocalsound> No , I mea I think it means sort of individually . Oh right , okay . Yes , no , maybe ? Mm-hmm . Okay . Groovy . So uh we're just gonna . Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry . Great leadership . <vocalsound> Excellent leadership . <vocalsound> Thank you very much . <vocalsound> You're all get you're all getting a raise . Uh teamwork . I thought went well . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think . Yeah . Uh and well means , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , we <gap> <disfmarker> The technical stuff was brilliant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Let's buy more . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh Right . Um Yeah . <vocalsound> These pens are are neat though . I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . <vocalsound> Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these <gap> , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything Yeah . Mm 'kay . Groovy . . At le <vocalsound> Yeah . So just general thumbs up for all of us then . <vocalsound> Hmm . That kind of unfortunately is too quick . Okay . Hmm . Okay . Well um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> . I suppose yeah . Um . Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's it , um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Right , right . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work . Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay . Whoops . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , maybe . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Does it go back in , does it ? Reusable . <gap> <gap> Something we should get <gap> . I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying . So <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh Brian , have you have you finished ? Uh-huh . Um I have , yes . Uh mine needs also this . Huh ? At last mine is also the presentation . Oh right , okay , you've got more , okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Oh , you got a presentation , Sorry uh . sorry . Oh ok It didn't bother to tell me that on this S <vocalsound> <vocalsound> thing . Is it ? Okay . Uh <vocalsound> is the project evaluated , that is mine . <vocalsound> Doesn't tell me . <vocalsound> Oh you're doing that . <vocalsound> Yeah . We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh . Mm , love to eat that now . Anybody <vocalsound> Kind of a green banana now . Mm . Clay covered banana . It's <disfmarker> this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . O okay , <vocalsound> I've got . hold on . <gap> blue . <gap> <vocalsound> I wonder w which cell do I want . <gap> It's fun to touch . Yeah . <vocalsound> So . Yeah . Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So . Oh could you pass the tomato please . <vocalsound> Sorry . Thank you . So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . Mm-hmm . How we are going to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> means uh at what standard what standard <disfmarker> whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is <disfmarker> will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . Okay . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as <gap> fashion trends or not ? Means <vocalsound> because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . Mm-hmm . So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite <gap> in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s Sorry <gap> . Sorry , carry on . <vocalsound> Yeah . So <vocalsound> but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So <disfmarker> Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . Okay . I'm having this scale this scale , Mm-hmm . so we have to do it on a board . <gap> Okay . Alright , okay . <gap> the user requirem I think . The board working again , is it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do we have the uh the marker for the board ? <gap> <vocalsound> Uh . Um . <vocalsound> Thank you . There it is . <vocalsound> <gap> So . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . Mm-hmm . First of all uh comes user requirement . So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will <disfmarker> first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? Um <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> Yeah , it did . It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . S Yeah . Um so . When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , Does it work ? so yeah , Yeah . So . of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . <vocalsound> So what do you think you will personally give . I would say seven . Seven . Uh . <vocalsound> Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't <disfmarker> True or false ? No sorry tr one is true . One , yeah . <vocalsound> Uh one is <disfmarker> means highest ranking , Yeah . okay . But I think highest ranking is seven , No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth or one ? No that's false . Okay , right right . Okay , so one . So it's one for from your point of view . Yep . And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? <vocalsound> Uh . It's hard to know . I I give it a two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh d you can you can tell on on the like <disfmarker> I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . Okay . But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um . But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . <vocalsound> Um <gap> I'm gonna give it a two . Two . Two . And what about uh you , Brian ? Oh , I'll go for a one . <vocalsound> You will go for one . Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah th <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm <vocalsound> and yellow . <disfmarker> Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh-huh . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . Come on that was the tha <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . Uh-huh . No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . Okay . So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , <vocalsound> Being fruitist . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> two or three kinds rather , and <disfmarker> Yeah . Is that no is that not trends ? <vocalsound> So . Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> because whatever companies <disfmarker> they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . Mm-hmm . Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So you can <gap> <disfmarker> what shape a person will like . So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . Uh-huh . But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um <disfmarker> you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have <disfmarker> That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . <vocalsound> We were coming up with one product . Uh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally <disfmarker> won't give it <gap> beyond three . No , I mean uh <vocalsound> obviously your opinion , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm just trying to <disfmarker> Okay . So we can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> He's a tough cookie . <vocalsound> Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . Three or four ? <vocalsound> Uh , no sorry , <vocalsound> it should be <disfmarker> Six . Five or six . What are we doing ? No What are we doing ? sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , Adding them up ? we are doing a very wrong thing . We're gonna average them ? Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , Okay . So seven fourths . and that's <disfmarker> Oh . I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh About one point f one point eight . three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two . Okay . Okay . <gap> because it is one point eight uh <gap> two , so we will do two . <vocalsound> Oh I see . Yeah round it up to two . Yeah . Okay , yeah . So where were the trends . So trends . Can you explain what you want us to write there ? Sorry ? How it <disfmarker> how conforms to the current trends ? Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the <vocalsound> uh as a fruit shape or something . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh . Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , <vocalsound> so I would actually give it a three . <vocalsound> Tha three or four , I'm not sure . Three . Go for three . Okay . Yeah . That's fine . Uh <disfmarker> 'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for Mm . for technology . Yeah , I am sort of pret uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well . Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now <disfmarker> our fashion trend shows that people like everything <disfmarker> all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them <gap> or showing some association with them . Mm-hmm . So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So that is also ef that also <disfmarker> Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . <vocalsound> So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen <gap> . So we can <disfmarker> Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ? Yeah . <gap> Well it was yellow . <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um <vocalsound> there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy a <vocalsound> two . Okay . Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . Okay . Yeah , Is that the question ? yeah . Is it ? Okay . <vocalsound> Um . Okay , so <vocalsound> one or two . Yeah . One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine . I'll go with two . So what about you , Brian ? Um yeah , a three . Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a <disfmarker> a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six <vocalsound> So one and a half . Yeah , one . half . So we can say two or one <gap> <disfmarker> A two . Okay . <gap> So th seven seven . Uh overall we are getting two <gap> something , but we can round it as two . Yep . Okay . Cool , groovy . <vocalsound> Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . S Cool . So we can launch it . Yeah . Brilliant . <vocalsound> Woo-hoo . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In which case we are done . 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Cool . So Champagne lunch anyone ? <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> Great . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh .
Here we go . Welcome everybody . Um , I'm Abigail Claflin . You can call me Abbie . 'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . There we go . So this is our kick off meeting . Um and I guess we should all get acquainted <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Let's <disfmarker> shall we all introduce ourselves ? Hi I'm Chiara , I'm the um Marketing Expert . Um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? I think we'll get around to that , yeah . We'll get round to that later . So this is just introductions yeah . My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert . Okay . I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> um so . <vocalsound> I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer . I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer . Okay . Um so f here's our agenda for today . Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . <vocalsound> Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to <disfmarker> um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . So . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um <vocalsound> so we're gonna try out our white board . If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ? Okay . <vocalsound> I think both . <vocalsound> Yeah . Both . Yeah <vocalsound> . Okay . Why don't we do both . Right . Who starts ? We ought to decide who starts and <vocalsound> all that . No ? Any volunteers ? Uh-huh . Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh <disfmarker> Does it have to be <vocalsound> functional , trendy and user friendly ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't think so . Um . Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one . <gap> Make sure <gap> my things here . Uh-oh . Right . Okay , my favourite animal is <disfmarker> see . <vocalsound> Oops . A dolphin . Yeah , it's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'S like playing Pictionary . <vocalsound> Yeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah . <vocalsound> It's my dolphin . <vocalsound> So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I like its tail . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , no , I think dolphins are really uh <disfmarker> I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> They're graceful . they're graceful yeah , and they're so <disfmarker> Sleek <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah they're sleek and they look intelligent <vocalsound> and I don't know , they're <disfmarker> I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing . I don't know how intelligent that one looks <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah he he doesn't look that smart <vocalsound> . He's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I dunno um they're <disfmarker> I think it's cool the the um <vocalsound> the interaction that or the th things that <disfmarker> the reasons people seem to like you know <disfmarker> you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like <vocalsound> <disfmarker> but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . <gap> <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Uh-oh there goes the ten . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It's a cat . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't know . They sleep all day , <vocalsound> they're easy to draw <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Do you wanna <gap> anything ? Uh yeah . I dunno if the the <disfmarker> Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one . I think the pen is running out of <disfmarker> ah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I'll use the spare one . Um but it's harder to draw <gap> um . And the pen's dying <vocalsound> . Um . A horse . Uh . Horse . Um I don't <vocalsound> really know how the legs go , <vocalsound> That's very good . <vocalsound> but anyway I will do that . Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . This cord's <disfmarker> <gap> Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet <vocalsound> . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's a pig . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? And furry . This is <disfmarker> yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah . <vocalsound> Textile <disfmarker> tactile , <vocalsound> tactile remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Although <disfmarker> uh I'll just put there . Right . You're dragging a <disfmarker> you have a tail <vocalsound> . <gap> Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . Sorry about that . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country <vocalsound> . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally . Sorry can you just say that <disfmarker> what's the <disfmarker> what are our price goals again ? Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro . Okay . How many should we sell then ? <vocalsound> Um , a lot , Anyone a mathematician ? <vocalsound> two two two million , <gap> two mi no , more f four million . Two million . Four million . And it <disfmarker> well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . <vocalsound> Oh , yeah . <vocalsound> It is a lot . Uh . So f that's a fifty percent um uh . Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find I was thinking that too . bec yeah <vocalsound> bec <vocalsound> Yeah . I think we should design something that has like a <disfmarker> so you can <disfmarker> like somehow like you <disfmarker> I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , I've always wanted that , <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah . so like <vocalsound> you can push a button on your T_V_ <disfmarker> Yeah . I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . Yeah . And even I think a little light . Um or even a <disfmarker> maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound <disfmarker> I don't know if it's expensive maybe to <disfmarker> Yeah . I don't <disfmarker> yeah I mean it <disfmarker> but like I mean <disfmarker> Maybe call is enough . But yeah . just I mean like your phone even just has so <disfmarker> like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . What if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it and you could <disfmarker> I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . Yeah . You know like a portable phone has a base , Yeah , or if it had a <disfmarker> yeah . like just to have a home for it . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Yeah , I mean <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well that's why it's always in the couch . Yeah . Yeah <vocalsound> . Yeah , in in the couch <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <gap> I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and <disfmarker> Yeah . Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah so we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the project is now couches and remote controls . But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive . Yeah . But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . Yeah . Yeah . Something like that . And the other thing is <disfmarker> Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? Bigger . Not <disfmarker> well it needs to be sort of <disfmarker> Like Hand Hand-sized . hand held size , yeah . Yeah . I don't think you need a <disfmarker> Not not huge , but <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But definitely not <disfmarker> well I don't know . It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it . No , it can't be , uh-uh . No it really wouldn't be . Or like or like a light thing . Huh . You know . I dunno <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Like spaceship . <vocalsound> . Yeah <vocalsound> . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That would be really <disfmarker> I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . Little homing device . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> . Uh . Okay . So what do we think this remote control should <disfmarker> Five minutes . Oh dear . Till the meeting <disfmarker> oh right . This is what we have left . I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , Um , oh we just <gap> 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and <disfmarker> Yeah , I agree . <vocalsound> B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything . Yeah , yeah yeah . Yeah . I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So . You <disfmarker> what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . That would be cool . Like the way a mobile phone does . Yeah . Yeah . I mean it just seems like <disfmarker> So you could like um <disfmarker> like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can <disfmarker> the way you do it on your radio is that you uh <disfmarker> yeah . what do you call it <disfmarker> Select . Uh . s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . That's something we could decide . Mm . I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno . Because <disfmarker> Because , I don't know if it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's e expensive , if you have <disfmarker> if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , Yeah . Yeah . and then use the telly as a screen . Right . But um <disfmarker> I'm thinking kind of <disfmarker> But yeah for sure . Something like not <disfmarker> it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , Yeah . is that what you mean ? Yeah . Right . Mm . Or like you h you see those you know people <disfmarker> I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those <disfmarker> these things that at their house you know <disfmarker> their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that <disfmarker> and it's like a hand held like <disfmarker> turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like <disfmarker> so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if <disfmarker> it must be <disfmarker> it would probably <disfmarker> Yeah . must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno . But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . Mm . Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true . Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point <disfmarker> twelve fifty for <disfmarker> to actually make the device . Yeah . Mm . Um but it's something to think about , yeah . Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah . I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . <vocalsound> Or some <disfmarker> it i we can find out probably on the internet <vocalsound> how much it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um <disfmarker> What was the word ? <vocalsound> Furry . Water resistant . Oh I was just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No but it's <disfmarker> I thought , ah , spot on . Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , <vocalsound> Yeah . maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . Yeah . Mm , mm . That's quite annoying . Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your <disfmarker> Yeah . like that's another <disfmarker> Yeah , clip . Ooh <vocalsound> . Um . Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um . So . Yeah . The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , Yeah I think so . yeah <vocalsound> um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The something , what is the U_I_ ? User . That's me . Yeah , what does it stand for again ? Uh , User Interface design . User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w So technical function . The working design is the structure . Yeah , yeah . What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what <disfmarker> Um , I guess you'd have to find out <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <gap> It says on that email but it <disfmarker> Um . It was in the email . It does but it <disfmarker> I just don't really <disfmarker> I wrote down what mine were . It said um <disfmarker> Yeah . It said <disfmarker> <vocalsound> What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright . Yeah like <disfmarker> And working design . Okay . Be a medium between you and the telly I think , Yeah , yeah . Alright . Mm . that's uh <disfmarker> And how it works , okay . Right . I'm I'm on task . And the M_E_ , what does that stand for <vocalsound> ? M Marketing . Marketing , right . Um <vocalsound> . Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um . So we'll be working on the user requirements , um <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes . I just did .
Right first time this time . Nu There we go . It's not that complicated , but I get it wrong every time . <vocalsound> Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew <gap> . For Matthew , yep . Mm . Uh <disfmarker> So I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . he's uh obviously late for some reason . <vocalsound> Good . Um . Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design . I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh concerning a uh conceptual design . Mm-hmm . Um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh <gap> . Uh I will take some minutes uh again . Mm-hmm . Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , Yep . Yep . and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented . So and that uh will uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh . Mm-hmm . So um who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ? I have a presentation , I'm just making this <disfmarker> Yeah I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah the <disfmarker> Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here Okay . because it's really a a team uh project with a team Ah there is Matthew . and if someone is not here then we cannot <disfmarker> Sorry . but it's okay <vocalsound> it's good . <vocalsound> Okay I'll just email you this file , my presentation . So . Good . Do <gap> presentation ready ? Mm-hmm I'm just emailing it to you . Oh okay . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> So did you manage uh <disfmarker> Yeah I sent you the slides , you didn't see them ? Oh yes I see him , good yes . Okay . <gap> . No . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'Kay . Okay it should've gone through to you . <vocalsound> Okay mm yes I have it . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . Um can I just put this on ? So we have to work out a way <disfmarker> what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . Um . This is <disfmarker> to do this I will not remove my microphone . <vocalsound> We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , <vocalsound> and as part of this <disfmarker> The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . The most important by far was the look and feel of it . It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out <vocalsound> . It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . People will wanna buy it . Um <disfmarker> That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative <disfmarker> has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . People have to then think about it and say <gap> got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to <disfmarker> be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . <vocalsound> This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm . Um I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . That would make it stand out . Um . Hmm . So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ? Spongy feel ? Uh about the feeling yeah uh yo <vocalsound> You can <disfmarker> Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , Okay . Mm . rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . Yeah . Okay . So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those <disfmarker> a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um . Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's another way of doing that . Mm-hmm . So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe <disfmarker> to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . Yeah . Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . They're big selling items . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't <disfmarker> I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . Mm-hmm . I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very <disfmarker> will be a really cool feature to put in . And <disfmarker> <gap> use . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , Mm . Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the <disfmarker> and then <disfmarker> yeah Yeah . <disfmarker> and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . Mm . Voila . Yep <vocalsound> and that's the presentation . Okay good , that's very clear . Yeah very clear . Yeah . 'Kay . Um . Uh <disfmarker> So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? I think you <disfmarker> Maybe we yes well we maybe <vocalsound> can decide later on um <vocalsound> the l the the look and feel of uh I've <disfmarker> it was a good idea maybe to to <disfmarker> To let the people choose , <gap> you mean ? Yes the the the there are changeable covers , Yeah . but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because <vocalsound> you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational <disfmarker> Hmm . <vocalsound> Well we're selling so many units of this . This is gonna be a mass marketed product , Hmm . Mm-hmm . we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . Yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects . Yes . Mm mm . Mm-hmm . Sure that fits the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yes <gap> and of course it will be a we we get a <disfmarker> if it works we can get uh after-sales Mm . I mean that would <gap> would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro <vocalsound> . Yeah . Mm . That's a very good idea um <disfmarker> And then uh maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because Yeah s Mm-hmm . the <disfmarker> then we could discuss later like <disfmarker> we can put all ideas together . Together indeed uh , Mm . Yeah yeah I agree . because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , It should be easier with that . what you were already mentioning . Yeah . Mm-hmm , yeah . Yeah . And your part is very related to mine So <disfmarker> because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside . Yeah . Yeah so <vocalsound> I'll I'll go with that actually Mm-hmm . so um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay so m so <vocalsound> then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . So what I have found was that uh currently uh the <gap> they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have Mm . and uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like <disfmarker> You can basically <disfmarker> if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the <gap> T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information <vocalsound> . Mm . Mm . I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . Yeah yeah That's a good idea . so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , <gap> . Mm . Yeah . even if you arrange it by <disfmarker> however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to <disfmarker> Hmm . Mm . Yeah I really like that idea . So what functionalities do you suggest for that ? For facing this problem ? So it it it's like it <gap> limited one . In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for <vocalsound> eighty word thing , eighty word , Mm-hmm . which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , Mm . you want to st store your favourite channel . Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most . Yeah some ten twelve channel information . You know Okay . you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . Mm . And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are <vocalsound> having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is <gap> now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Oh yeah yeah yeah mm . to model the functionalities will increase actually , Mm . Mm . and for you and you might want <vocalsound> Mm . you don't want separate keys for all of them . You can't . And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . Mm-hmm . So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . I personally would look at <vocalsound> things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having <gap> unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . Mm-hmm . I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , <vocalsound> and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , Mm b you know , and uh <disfmarker> But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . <vocalsound> Yeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word Mm . and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing Mm . Mm . which is again <disfmarker> and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you're uh <disfmarker> it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . Mm . Yeah . At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also <vocalsound> <gap> or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And you want okay <disfmarker> for coming back to one point Two thirty five supposed to finish . y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ? Yeah you can let them to do that . And uh isn't that too difficult for the <disfmarker> we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use , Hmm . that's the <gap> compromise . N no but the <disfmarker> if you give <disfmarker> it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . Yeah . Hmm . Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user Mm . or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . I think you can do it both ways . So it de You can have it so it's easy <gap> they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , A standard . Yeah . or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . Um yes So <disfmarker> Yeah . but but I do <vocalsound> <disfmarker> maybe you can <vocalsound> give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> I'm sorry to have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Every time I have to come down on this price again Hmm . Hmm . to <vocalsound> so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , but it's it's it's the real <disfmarker> Hmm . <vocalsound> We have to consider it . S so <vocalsound> Yeah . do we think these ideas <vocalsound> an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh <vocalsound> uh case of the <disfmarker> Mm . Hmm . Mm-hmm yeah like <vocalsound> I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , Yeah . Mm . Yeah . but for the A_S_R_ system , uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this We well we can still look at <disfmarker> We <vocalsound> we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , yeah yeah Mm . yeah . and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip . Maybe we can come <vocalsound> we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , Mm mm . you know . Yeah . And also well you can think of having uh since you have a <disfmarker> you know something <gap> maybe if you added little bit of <gap> display , you might need the <disfmarker> to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some <vocalsound> kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ <vocalsound> Hmm . Hmm . it could actually be used to detect also . Yeah . If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . Mm . Hmm . Yeah <vocalsound> . Hmm . So <disfmarker> Mm . I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something . No actually <vocalsound> i if i it is like <disfmarker> you know it tells you um , it can be for two purposes , Mm . like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , Mm . Hmm . which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ . Mm . It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it <disfmarker> and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . Mm . Hmm . It's true . And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something Mm . and it can change the colour depending on your uh <disfmarker> how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . Mm-hmm . You know . <gap> . 'Kay good . Yeah so <disfmarker> I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the <disfmarker> Mm yes um You you have time some more ? I would <disfmarker> Yep . Yes yes you can you can still . We have time . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Sure you can you know <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . Mm-hmm . So the method is <disfmarker> ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like <gap> , and uh what cost <disfmarker> the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . So there are two uh different types of uh um <disfmarker> Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . Nice . <vocalsound> Hmm . Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an <gap> that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board <gap> buttons , infrared <vocalsound> , led , etcetera , for the components um . So you <gap> finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . and uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um . So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . And uh so I think <vocalsound> for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology , Yeah mm mm-hmm . and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to <gap> them and connect them . Mm-hmm . So my personal design <vocalsound> we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . If it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or <vocalsound> Mm . I dunno . <vocalsound> Well well <vocalsound> <vocalsound> m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . Yes . Yes . Mm-hmm . So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yes . Mm just have a yeah <disfmarker> Yeah like they do in with cars I think . Yeah inside the car Just the veneer on it , yeah . yeah . So they also emailed me that uh they have <vocalsound> available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a <gap> computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , Yeah . so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . And the final point okay is um we have <disfmarker> yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . Hmm . So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but <vocalsound> I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . Mm-hmm . So to <vocalsound> to sum up um we need <vocalsound> yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert Sorry . Mm . so that we can <disfmarker> it's really a team-working uh . So Mm . I I cannot design something without your agreement , Yeah so right ? No of course . of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , Yes . or if you want to store a programmes with a keys <disfmarker> What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside <disfmarker> W wh what <disfmarker> Yeah it's kind of um simple <gap> pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . W what <disfmarker> Okay . I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions Okay . of <disfmarker> Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the <gap> card . Exactly yeah , for customizing and yeah . Yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually . Okay . How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . Yeah . Yeah good idea . So <disfmarker> So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features . Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , Yes . we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . and yeah . So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . Yes . D well <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Do you think that's feasible ? Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . Uh <disfmarker> You th you think it's possible . Is it possible to fit in to that ? Yeah also thinking , I think both uh <disfmarker> if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay , Sorry . Hmm . but uh <disfmarker> <gap> . Well maybe we need specific costings then . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . Yeah that's an excellent idea . Mm yes wh when you make a <vocalsound> a design ca you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . Yeah yeah . Yeah That w that would be a very good idea . Mm . because right now I don't have <gap> price in in head but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that . Mm . Good good . Yeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . Yeah . For example if f if you want to put wood <disfmarker> I wouldn't suggest for wood Okay . uh <gap> 'cause it's <disfmarker> I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber <gap> rather than wood . I agree on that . Yeah . Mm . It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials Yeah . Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah it's uh <disfmarker> which which come with a with another price . <vocalsound> Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is <gap> but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is <disfmarker> it's much better with that rather than going for <disfmarker> Do do you agree ? Yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , Mm yeah sure . Yeah . and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh <vocalsound> graphs or I don't know uh <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that . Ma I I think uh for next meeting we c <vocalsound> you two can present a real design . Uh so drawing it on the board . Yeah . Yea Mm-hmm . Okay . Perfect yeah . And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . So um <disfmarker> Let let's say next meeting w <vocalsound> you produce two designs , one one one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . <vocalsound> Yeah sure . Yeah we will uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case Uh . which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . Mm . Yeah . But that that that that can be done later . Yeah customized . <gap> . We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . Mm . Um . Okay <vocalsound> <gap> . We can give them smooth keys , you know . Smooth keys with bigger s uh <disfmarker> So that you know <disfmarker> The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , Yeah . Mm . and every time we have to be very <disfmarker> but if i the <disfmarker> if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together So is there any of these that you're looking at particularly to <disfmarker> or is this just ideas ? Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , Mm-hmm . and uh <vocalsound> now you can , for example , as I was <gap> if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . Hmm . Mm . At the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all <gap> problem . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm yeah . Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think . Uh big keys may better <gap> for them actually and uh <disfmarker> You see ? I agree yeah , and not too m too many keys of course yeah . Yeah . No no . Mm well Yeah . one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , Mm mm mm . and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . Mm w but then you have still have uh Yeah . when you don't <gap> use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you don't use . Mm . So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Um yeah I've seen that before too . Yeah . Anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . Yes . Yes . Yeah so it's something like this , the model here s <gap> you can put the keys <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well . That's what you mean ? Yes I I th that's what I mean Yeah . Yeah . so I mean something like like a book . I like this one . I like the shape of this one . <vocalsound> Yeah . Can we have <disfmarker> can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box Yeah I like also this one . that's a <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe curved or something . Yeah , mm . the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should <vocalsound> dec decide numbers or <disfmarker> Mm mm 'kay . We should make a <disfmarker> Is this for the next meeting though ? I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah that <disfmarker> yeah next meeting we should be <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . Ju just make two designs , Yeah that would depend upon us actually . Yeah yeah yeah . and the we we can decide decide between th those designs . Yep . Yeah okay . I think that would be a good idea . Perfect . So anyone uh any questions for now ? <vocalsound> No no . I don't have . No . So is this <disfmarker> is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? Um yes I come to that uh uh <disfmarker> Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . Yes well m maybe uh , I don't know whether that's possible , maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow . Mm . Okay well is this <vocalsound> me designing a way to evaluate it so <disfmarker> Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? <vocalsound> I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time Mm . but a as far as possible . Okay . Yep . So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes Exactly . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email . Two or three prototypes ? Two . Two . Two ? One for like cost and the one with like higher-end I <disfmarker> Okay . Mm <gap> and then <disfmarker> Mm . so that then we can be easily comparing them Yeah or you know find a compromise between both of them , Hmm . <vocalsound> and find maybe a compromise . Hmm . Yes okay . yeah that's how it is . Perfect yeah . Mm-hmm . Yep . Okay let's call this to an end . Mm 'kay . Okay . Thanks guys . Thanks . So we are done for now . <gap> .
Help . <gap> It's up there ? That screen's black . <gap> <gap> Alright , okay . Okay , that's fine . <vocalsound> Oh God . Are we done ? Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place . <vocalsound> Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ? Uh , no that's okay , sorry . Okay , um <vocalsound> I'll go over what we decided last meeting , Mm-hmm . um , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment . Sorry . Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um <disfmarker> try not to reflect our budget , um that we might have a bit of <disfmarker> oh oh you can see it , okay <vocalsound> . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . <vocalsound> Um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . Okay . Um , three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ? Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information , No that's fine , that's fine . <gap> is that okay ? Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the <disfmarker> Unplug me . Thanks . What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ? Um , F_N_ function F_ eight . Oh right , yeah . Okay . Maybe <disfmarker> Yep . Yep there we go . Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire . <vocalsound> 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What <disfmarker> the first thing <disfmarker> question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that <disfmarker> well it wasn't really my area because <vocalsound> I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Um and uh <vocalsound> I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . Mm-hmm . Could I <disfmarker> can I interject to ask a question there , Mm-hmm . Yeah sure . is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the <gap> surrounding it ? Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , Mm-hmm . they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? Yeah the the <disfmarker> They are . well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones Okay . Oh I see . but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . Okay . Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . <vocalsound> Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the <disfmarker> w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh <disfmarker> just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer . And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . <gap> It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the <vocalsound> uh U_I_ interface um which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would <disfmarker> the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to <vocalsound> whatever um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and <disfmarker> reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the <disfmarker> it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of <disfmarker> d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa <vocalsound> thing that you could have , Mm . Mm . I <disfmarker> th that was just sort of a general point there . Mm . <vocalsound> And that's uh <disfmarker> yeah . That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there , so if you wanna <disfmarker> Okay , thank you very much . Um , would you like to continue on from that ? Yep . Ooh . 'Kay . Or , maybe move the laptop over . It can be <disfmarker> okay , that's okay with me . <gap> further . <gap> <gap> Oops . Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ? F_ function . Function F_ eight yeah . Okay . Mm why's it in the right ? No . The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No . Yeah , it's connecting <gap> . No , no yeah it's just <gap> . Meter adjusting . <gap> okay . Oh , there <gap> . Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , Yeah . but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's <disfmarker> it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering <gap> maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will <gap> this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you <disfmarker> you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like <disfmarker> it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh <disfmarker> added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not <disfmarker> of no use of punching in the uh <disfmarker> trying to put in those things in <disfmarker> on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah . Yeah , with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in <disfmarker> add in more features and make it less costly . Um , that's <disfmarker> so this is <disfmarker> if you ask me personally , I would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use <disfmarker> usage and all that . Yeah . So in overall a simple and uh user-friendly design . Mm . Uh any comments like , if you want ? 'Kay . Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end , Okay . okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um <disfmarker> 'Kay . Yeah sure . Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . Oh , God . Right , okay . Have I got to keep this here ? I think you'll have to <disfmarker> You can't <disfmarker> Does it matter ? It'll have to <disfmarker> this can't be pulled . I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? We just do the best we can . Uh , whoops . You'll have to push it a bit more . Will it manage ? Bit more , oh dear . <vocalsound> Yep . Yeah this is more than enough . There we go , Okay . I've got a bit more of the cable <vocalsound> . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> There we go . Is that okay ? Yeah I think you can pull it out now . Thank you , just pull it closer a little bit . <gap> Uh you should be able to <gap> and <disfmarker> Yeah , you might . Get it right over , yeah , there you go . okay , thank you . Ah . Look at that . Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . <vocalsound> Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . <vocalsound> Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . Yeah . So again there's power implications there . <vocalsound> Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take <disfmarker> said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh <disfmarker> when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . <vocalsound> I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , 'Kay . but I think I'll just keep it simple , if there's any more information I can email you extra details , <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . <gap> That's fine . is that okay ? Okay . Right , um Huh . we have new project requirements , um we're not going to be using teletext , Okay . um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um <vocalsound> our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? It says for T_V_ only , so <vocalsound> looks like it's just <disfmarker> Just channel-hopping . yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but <vocalsound> I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . Would that imply video use ? But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well . T yeah yeah . I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ? Yeah . If yeah <disfmarker> Mm-hmm , yes . and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . Mm . I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and <vocalsound> programming . Yes . <vocalsound> Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? Yeah . Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , Mm . Ten perc Mm-hmm . I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on Yeah . and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare <vocalsound> Okay . Hmm . Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing Mm-hmm . Pens and they're not that great anyway . In fact I've just called up that table there , Alright , okay . we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? Alright , okay . So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , Mm-hmm . Yeah . and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology . Yeah , Yeah but um on on that again I just thought <disfmarker> 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is Mm-hmm . bu Oh yeah . Right . so I thought that could be quite a <disfmarker> We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing Mm . um because it is something I <disfmarker> it needs to be <disfmarker> the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , Yeah . Yeah . maybe <vocalsound> on the T_V_ <disfmarker> you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , Yes . Yeah . Okay . That's a super idea . but that's <disfmarker> that sounds a lot cheaper to me . Hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Um <vocalsound> the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . Um , people paying more for it to look good . Um , we need to focus on that as well . Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty Yeah . and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , Mm . you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may <disfmarker> and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . Yeah . Yeah . So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs <gap> ? Sure . Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs Alright . I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . Right . Mm-hmm . Just <disfmarker> The features could be same and the body could look slightly different . Yeah . yeah , yeah . Mm . So <disfmarker> What about <disfmarker> you were talking about the buttons , Yeah . um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about um you know with the touch screen computers 'Kay . Yeah , yeah that's what I was just <disfmarker> yeah . yeah ? Um so you <disfmarker> it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the <disfmarker> No , well no <gap> 'cause you wouldn't have to <disfmarker> you don't actually have to press them you just <disfmarker> You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . <gap> Yeah . Um , think that might appeal <disfmarker> I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , Mm . Mm-hmm . trendy kind of a thing . Yeah . Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can <gap> oh yeah that's obvious what that's for Mm-hmm . and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm , mm . Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um <vocalsound> if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big Were too big . because um <vocalsound> they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands Mm . so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh <disfmarker> so if you <disfmarker> I don't know what <disfmarker> 'cause you <disfmarker> obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . Yeah , uh maybe to <disfmarker> as uh <disfmarker> it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . Yeah . Yeah . So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market . Mm-hmm . Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control Yeah . and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . Hmm . I think we have to design one product Huh . Yeah . and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , Yeah . Mm-hmm . not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . Mm-hmm . I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . Yeah . I'm j I really can't get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting Yeah . but it's something we should think about . I <disfmarker> yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause <disfmarker> without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel Mm . I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know . and it becomes <disfmarker> yeah . Or a speech recognition , Yeah , speech recognition , Yeah . which is extremely expensive , but <disfmarker> yeah . I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . Yes . Mm-hmm . Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um . Mm . We could focus on the biggest market . Mm . Ge uh <disfmarker> If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . We are <disfmarker> we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . <vocalsound> That they want um it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume <disfmarker> associate that with the older generations . Mm . Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm <vocalsound> . but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people . Mm . Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate Mm-hmm . and uh you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first <disfmarker> it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ , Mm-hmm . we've got the video , now there's um I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , Video plus . yes . We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , Yeah yeah . is that <disfmarker> I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um Mm . Mm-hmm . because you've got your general record anyway so if you <disfmarker> there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in Just whack in the number . and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , And you w <vocalsound> yeah . it's just a number . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one No . 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . yeah . Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> It is after um <disfmarker> if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards It's not <disfmarker> Yeah . and that's the number you put in Ah , hmm . and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times , Right . um and it has been around for quite a long time . It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . No it's not Superb . um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Yes . Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it <disfmarker> you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on Mm . Right . and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . Excellent , mm-hmm . So that <disfmarker> yeah . Mm . But just to have that function would be would be really good . Right . Okay so <disfmarker> Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , <gap> to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? Mm . <vocalsound> But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um <disfmarker> the companies who uh who you deal with have actually <disfmarker> they've they've got an obligation to to help you out Mm . Mm-hmm . and also <disfmarker> I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having <disfmarker> Right . The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ? Alright . <vocalsound> Yes <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , <gap> but I mean for <disfmarker> if there were any more <disfmarker> or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , we're not gonna put any <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , I think so . I mean <disfmarker> okay , just a thought . Um <disfmarker> I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . Instruction manuals . Okay . But I mean they're <disfmarker> there's customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to Yeah . Department , yeah . Mm-hmm . Sure . and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um . Mm . Right . Yeah . I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to <disfmarker> for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , Yeah . but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . Not for such simple functions And they're <disfmarker> yeah , they should be f yeah . because we're focusing on that , Mm . yes okay . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible Simple . Mm . Yeah . because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . Yeah . Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . It's the uh <disfmarker> It does , yeah . you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . Sure , okay . Mm-hmm . Um , what other functions ? We need <disfmarker> I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about <disfmarker> c 'cause you've got the dilemma between <disfmarker> oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but <disfmarker> Well they la they they last quite a long time , Mm-hmm . and if you had uh <disfmarker> when you <disfmarker> th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . Yeah . Um , something like that should reduce the size of it . Yeah and if <disfmarker> yeah if you if you had if you had one of those <disfmarker> uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh <disfmarker> Yeah it could be on that <disfmarker> Yeah on that as well so . yeah , okay . S So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? Yeah some sort of docking station or <disfmarker> Yes . Rechargeable with a docking station . Mm-hmm . yeah . So the rechargeable which would be your field . Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , Okay . and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . Yes , Mm-hmm . Right . which it is cheaper in the long run as well . Yeah . Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many <disfmarker> <vocalsound> how much you try and make it simple , Mm . um <disfmarker> And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . They do . Yeah . We definitely <disfmarker> an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that . Okay so we've got a flip-screen . Okay . Um <disfmarker> What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . Yeah . That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , Mm-hmm . so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you don't have to <disfmarker> you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . Slightly curved , curved . Yeah . Okay . G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't Mm . 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . y yeah Mm . so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your <disfmarker> Yeah . the way you h hold of <disfmarker> it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . Okay . I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . Can you look into the company logo ? Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . Current . I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite um obviously into the design , <gap> while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . We could look in at that I mean look at the mobile . but <disfmarker> Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as <disfmarker> you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . I think that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that sounds a really attractive idea , I've not come across anything like that before , A sea shell ? if it kind of <disfmarker> yeah and that opens out into your flip-top . Yeah . Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea Yeah we could look in at that . and plus you can get <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you know even though we're using plastic , you can still <disfmarker> I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . Mm . You could have different kind of casings . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa Yeah . and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't <disfmarker> not gonna lose it so much <vocalsound> either . It's easier to <disfmarker> bit nice to handle . Mm . Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are <disfmarker> whichever appeals the most like , Okay . Yeah . Mm-hmm . that could be the most common design . Okay . Okay . Okay . But we can like think of five , six designs . Right , I think we have to round it up , um <disfmarker> Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . Sure . So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , Mm-hmm . our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus . That was um in cutting down the number <disfmarker> that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date <disfmarker> Right . Right . Right , so when they press for programming you <disfmarker> it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and <disfmarker> Or was <disfmarker> is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just <disfmarker> that was an add-on feature ? <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . Uh-huh . Right . Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? Um it could be it c It <disfmarker> Yeah . yes , Right . it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , you know , drawing attention to that . And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . Yeah . Was there anything else there that we <disfmarker> in the new new project requirements ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um . Yeah . Mm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at , Yes . Yes . what preference <disfmarker> so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . For detection , right . Yeah . Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um . I think <disfmarker> Yep , Yep , and different from what's out there . I think <disfmarker> Okay . Yep , I think that's us . What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? True . Okay . Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? I think you might get guidance , but um I th Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing , Okay . u um , they're <disfmarker> everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them . Okay . Um . Whoops , questionnaire four . Oops . We should f Yes , right . Okay . 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think . I think it's time for us to get back to <disfmarker> Right , okay . I think you can email me , if there's any more questions . Um and I'll be able to not answer them .
So welcome . The first kick-off meeting . What shall we do ? First the opening , then the rest . What are we going to do . We m have to make a new remote control . <vocalsound> It has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . So we will get back th on that . First we have to make a functional design . After that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . So we'll discuss that later . First we have a look at <gap> . So first to <disfmarker> we have to make a small painting . What have <disfmarker> do we have to do . First you can save the documents . We have to do that every time we make something . You can print it . No . And we have to use <vocalsound> the pen and the eraser . So <disfmarker> Now . <vocalsound> We all have to use this one . You have to make your own favourite animal . <vocalsound> So I'll make an example . Yep . <vocalsound> First don't touch that things . <vocalsound> You can use the pen . And then you can make <vocalsound> um something . <vocalsound> Nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um you can change some things . <vocalsound> Um format , line , and change it . <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And you can change the colour . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> An elephant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So that's it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> So and after it you have to save it . <vocalsound> Okay . Now we can make a new one . You have to paint now . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you're next . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Well we will try . Where it going ? <gap> . Hmm . That's uh strange . <vocalsound> <gap> . What is going on ? <gap> pop-ups . What are you <disfmarker> What ? Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> What is this , Pictionary . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Uh a bird . Is a <disfmarker> It is a <disfmarker> It is a <disfmarker> Bird . A duck . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Now save ? Yeah . Yes . Hmm . Now uh blank ? Blank , yes . Yeah . Yeah . Okay next one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Let's try this . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Whoo . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Um . Mm-hmm . Mm . <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Oh not . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Yeah . No problem . <vocalsound> Shit happens . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now . Okay . A parrot . Ish . Wow . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> He did it before . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , no . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> Nice . Oh . Very good . Uh blank . Thank you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Very good . So um you can always go back . <gap> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . So <vocalsound> now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So <disfmarker> Uh I will start . F first <gap> . Uh <disfmarker> <gap> <vocalsound> Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . No . And uh g big buttons , <vocalsound> m uh that's easier to use than uh <disfmarker> I think . Not all the small buttons , you don't know <disfmarker> Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ? Big buttons , positive . Positive . All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . Okay . What are your experiences ? Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And that it controls the channels and the the volume . Mm . And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it <disfmarker> in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working . And uh yeah . Uh <disfmarker> So and do they always have that ? Yeah , but <disfmarker> No no no . But I <disfmarker> my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . It's easy to you . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . 'Kay . Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . <vocalsound> Thank you . That's not really ea easy . Help also . <vocalsound> Thank you . So it would be nice if we have one for all . And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v <vocalsound> not easy to use . So we n barely used it . Okay so they have too much . So next . Hmm . For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? <vocalsound> The weight . Not not too heavy . Not too heavy . Not much buttons . Yes . Yeah . Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . Yes . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some <gap> <disfmarker> uh some sort of bleep . <vocalsound> Like a phone . And then you uh , hey there there's remote control . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So , Next . that's <gap> . Yeah well that's <disfmarker> that are good ideas . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah I think it uh <disfmarker> from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it . Yes . And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . Okay . This is <disfmarker> It has to be compatible with other things . Yes . Okay . I have one more idea . Just popped up . Yes ? Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't <disfmarker> won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . No battery use . So more ideas ? Mm no . No okay . It's only the first ideas . So <vocalsound> uh what are we going to do now is <disfmarker> Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do . Well look on your <gap> . And <disfmarker> Next instructions you'll get in your email . So <disfmarker> This is the first meeting . See you later in half an hour . Yes . Okay . Thank you . Okay .
Oh . It's not saved yet . Okay . So <disfmarker> Okay . Our beautiful drawing . So just f um <disfmarker> So this is our agenda . You're <disfmarker> F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . Oops . Okay . Uh I didn't <disfmarker> Oh yeah . So these are the <disfmarker> Oh , okay . Yeah . So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report . Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay . Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in . Okay , just <vocalsound> <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh <disfmarker> Yeah , and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know . Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls . It's probably better . Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you <gap> other functions . <vocalsound> It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well . Maybe that's better . Yeah . Yeah , that's that's a very good point . Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . Think that's better . So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . Yeah . Okay . So this is okay ? <gap> <gap> No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then . Okay , so that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The <disfmarker> Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . But um <disfmarker> Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah . Okay , for the <disfmarker> Yeah , I I think so . I don't know . Okay . No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So <disfmarker> Okay . Ah okay . So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay . Good . So you can show your prototype if you want to . Yeah . Together ? Yeah , it's <disfmarker> Let's do it together . I'll give comments . Okay . Yeah , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . <vocalsound> Uh the material should be hard plastic . Mm-hmm . Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements . Uh we have <disfmarker> The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel . Okay , cool . <vocalsound> And this is the the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic . Okay . And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger . Means <disfmarker> So you hold it like this in your right hand and <disfmarker> Mm . So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ? <vocalsound> Speech recognition . Yeah , speech recognition . Just <disfmarker> Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . Only one button to say it's on or off . Uh I dunno . Um so I've <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it . Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . Yeah , you can <gap> put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . Okay . That's uh <disfmarker> Okay . Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But <disfmarker> You have a lot of room if you can slide it open . Yeah , you can put it separate . You <disfmarker> Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So <disfmarker> But it's enough room . Yeah . Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh <disfmarker> Uh well <disfmarker> You wrote this , so . Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . <gap> That was the the most important thing . So uh the best <gap> place , the best reach place <disfmarker> Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's <vocalsound> basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then . Yeah . Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . Okay yeah , they <gap> <disfmarker> But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . Mm yeah . Yeah okay . That's that's below that then . Yeah , okay . It's uh twelve buttons . <gap> just so you get that . Okay , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's rather important . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah okay , just we just missed that . But um I'll just uh <disfmarker> I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular . Um <disfmarker> The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . Okay . So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh <vocalsound> in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . Okay . And also in the num-pads , there's also colour <gap> light behind it . And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? So when you pre Yeah . How do you want to implement that ? Just on the <disfmarker> We're going to implement . Maybe on the second level as well ? Yeah . Mm just a little <disfmarker> Ah . Yeah , these are just basic functions , so <disfmarker> All the non-basic are in <disfmarker> Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . That function must be <disfmarker> Okay , maybe we use this button for the <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe <disfmarker> Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions . Yeah , I um <disfmarker> Yeah , as well . Just make make a <gap> <disfmarker> To your video device . Yeah . Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A second level ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like a a new blank one or <disfmarker> Or just here ? No no , just on <disfmarker> Down there . Is i Ah okay . Okay . So uh <disfmarker> Yeah . And h how does the second level come out ? Just uh if you s Uh it slides uh along ? Um slides I think . Yeah , y Maybe , yeah . It's From from the uh beneath ? For the bottom . You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . No , you gotta slide it . If that breaks then you're screwed . Yeah , it's right . So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um <disfmarker> So what do we need ? Uh i the the speech functions buttons . Yeah , just <disfmarker> Menu ? Menu button . With uh maybe uh arrows . So you can uh <vocalsound> scroll in the , navigate the menu . Um <disfmarker> God damn it . Scart ? <gap> I think we can even put a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . Uh yeah . And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes . <vocalsound> So you have one left for the <disfmarker> So this is the <disfmarker> Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often . Yeah . <gap> If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day . <vocalsound> It's a f <vocalsound> basic uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Extern or something . <gap> You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? That was it . So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many . Uh <disfmarker> Doesn't really matter . I don't know the functions . Just just uh <disfmarker> It doesn't really matter . That's <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah well we don't have any uh <disfmarker> What else ? Hmm ? What else ? What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows . Uh menu . Yeah , to navigate . Uh <gap> With arrows . S Just uh like <disfmarker> Um I think it's best if we do . Mm where do we have <disfmarker> Or there . Like a normal um <disfmarker> Like on the normal uh <disfmarker> Like this . Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . The menu button , yes . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it . <vocalsound> Mm okay . Yeah . Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ? Yeah . Yep . Uh and and you can hold it , <gap> you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons . Yeah . Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ? <gap> okay . Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and <disfmarker> Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . If we have enough place , uh then we can do that . Yeah , okay . That's that's very easy , yeah . We can put those here . Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or Yeah . <disfmarker> Okay . Yep . Okay . Okay . That's uh <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> So did we miss anything ? Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . It <disfmarker> Some text uh buttons . Okay . Yeah . Yeah , but I just uh <disfmarker> The volume logo . No , ma on on o on the on the <disfmarker> there's one there's one text button I <disfmarker> Oh wh Here ? Yeah . Yeah . <gap> Okay . Just make it <disfmarker> There's one text button I prefer . Yeah , or th or the <disfmarker> That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . Yeah , we have that on the the text button . Yeah . Do you do you <disfmarker> Did you think of that ? Yep . Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then <disfmarker> Uh why not ? Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . Ex Yeah . Yeah . No <disfmarker> Well w we thought of a text button . Whoa <disfmarker> And if you press it again , you get the the the I think um <disfmarker> The sta the state you <disfmarker> Oh just three stages , through view . you <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , the three stages . Yes . Yeah , that's okay . Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . So you can switch back from second to w first . No , it doesn't have to turn it off . No . Just remember where it was . Just don't <gap> <disfmarker> It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . Yeah . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? Yes , that's to remember . Okay , okay . Yeah , but that's that's uh <disfmarker> But maybe it's not the way <disfmarker> I dunno if <gap> <disfmarker> That's a functionality for the television . <vocalsound> Yeah , I think as well , but <disfmarker> Uh yeah . Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . Yeah mm nee uh <disfmarker> No , if i <vocalsound> uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on . Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the Okay . Yeah , but you have to search every time again . Th i the chip . That's what what happening if you do it like that . Yeah , that's true . But it's still the television that has to do that . Yeah , I dunno . Okay . So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or <disfmarker> Mm <vocalsound> most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages . No , that's what the television does . Yeah , those memory functions . But uh not not every every television , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , it's cool . Was uh this logo for uh volume ? Yeah , that's fine . Okay . So that's it ? Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ? Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ? Mm . No no Just like your telephone , hard plastic . Yeah . Just hard plastic . So <disfmarker> Okay . Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . are uh <disfmarker> And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ? I think just on the buttons . Uh I think just um <disfmarker> If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space . Well yeah . That's too much place . Yeah , but <disfmarker> Okay , just leave it . Just leave it . I don't think the space is worth it . Yeah , and i I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . The most time <disfmarker> Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay . <gap> Okay . Fine . Yeah ? Okay , cool . Mm mm mm mm mm . Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one . Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . Okay . I d d d I don't think if it's right . <vocalsound> That shall show it . You have some usability criteria or <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay . Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . Uh <disfmarker> Oh . In the bottom . Yeah . Look-and-feel ? Evaluation crit No , evaluation is <disfmarker> Yeah , evaluation presentation . It's not in . Uh d it doesn't matter um <disfmarker> It only had two pages or something . <vocalsound> Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our Okay . um <vocalsound> model . And this <disfmarker> Okay . These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um <vocalsound> we have to discuss about <vocalsound> , if we give it a one or a seven . Uh <disfmarker> Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . It's <disfmarker> Yes . Mm . We are actu We are the <disfmarker> Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and <vocalsound> and that kind of stuff . Flashy . <vocalsound> Okay . Well I think we do <disfmarker> The LEDs . If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think . Yes . And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? But uh <disfmarker> Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . Hmm ? The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? Or you haven't thought about <disfmarker> Um basic colours , um yeah . Well you didn't say . Ho how do we make uh <disfmarker> Maybe um company colours ? It's black . Black and yellow . Black . Yeah , yellow light . A bit a bit of yellow . Can <disfmarker> Do we have yellow light ? No , not really , but it's possible . Not not not yellow <gap> , but just a bit of light yellow . It's <disfmarker> Black white , maybe ? Like white , also ni or uh always nice . And what colours should the buttons be ? Uh <disfmarker> Because um <disfmarker> Yeah , different colours . This is <disfmarker> Just um <disfmarker> Oh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it . But can you change those too , with uh the switch ? Yes . No , no . Make them <disfmarker> No , just make them black or grey or something . Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think . Okay . Yeah . Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours . Well we have changeable fronts , so <disfmarker> Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . So <disfmarker> Yeah , just give it a one . It's okay . Yeah . It's perfect . I think it's just what you want . Or not ? <vocalsound> It's hard to decide for us , but yeah . Yeah . It's ju so subjective . It it's <disfmarker> At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls . Yeah . Okay , just give it a two . <vocalsound> A two . Okay . The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . Yeah . Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . Yeah . One more thing . So <disfmarker> Are w are we changing uh <disfmarker> Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ? Slide panel ? Yeah ? Mm . Not needed <gap> . No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers Yeah , not needed I think . and uh <disfmarker> And and the switch channel is uh <disfmarker> There is a back light too ? Oh , you mean th this here ? That as well , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but that's unnecessary . What do I think is necessary necessary item ? It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , <vocalsound> it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but <vocalsound> I don't know if it's reachable . Yeah . <vocalsound> Of course it's reachable . It doesn't make <disfmarker> Then we do it . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something . No . Yeah . Just a green light or some blue light . To light it all up . Yeah , But <disfmarker> Yeah . Mayb Okay . but <disfmarker> Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons . And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . Yeah . So the buttons are just grey . Okay . Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent . Yeah , just only <disfmarker> Yeah , that's right . Okay . Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . So <disfmarker> Yeah , that's how I think . So I'll give it a <disfmarker> Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so <disfmarker> Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so <disfmarker> Ye Yeah , this <disfmarker> It is a one . Yeah . It's okay . It's cool . I think it's one . Okay , next . This is a difficult one , because we we don't <disfmarker> Yeah , we don't know it about the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Learnable ? Easy to use ? Yeah , we shall test it <vocalsound> But uh <disfmarker> Uh <vocalsound> it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . Yeah . It's <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> No , but you don't have to use that . Yeah . And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . No . So I think it's easy to use , but <disfmarker> And learnable is a bit <disfmarker> Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . Well , I think it is . Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . Well y just uh f I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or <disfmarker> Uh then the re But the rest of it is very easy , because there are so so n Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does . So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . Yes . Yeah . Okay . But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . Okay . But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> Yeah it's <disfmarker> And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? Device . And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it . And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um <vocalsound> easy to use . But <disfmarker> yeah . Because easy to use comes after learnable . Okay . Okay , just <disfmarker> Easy to use is very cool , I I think it a three or something . so just give it a two . Maybe three then . Learnable's <disfmarker> No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah . Mm uh . The normal . Yeah okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know <disfmarker> Yep , true . Then a two . Oh . Okay . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> New features . Techno technological innovative ? The speech function and the colour . Colour . <vocalsound> The speech function is new . And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide . The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new . Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a <disfmarker> Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . Okay . So that's not new . But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Okay , and the the the lightning ? That's cool . Is that new ? Yeah for a <disfmarker> Uh for a f The lighting's new . Mm it's pretty new , I think . Yes . Scrollwheel . Speech ? Speech is new . Different colours , so <disfmarker> Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . Yeah . Yeah . So we have a pretty new uh <disfmarker> There are no games on it , that's that's <disfmarker> It's not a one , it's a two again . That would <disfmarker> And we didn't uh <disfmarker> It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something . But then we also have the the home station . If you have <disfmarker> We are forgetting about that now , but <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable . Uh-oh . Home-station . We don't Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but <disfmarker> recharge . But that's more like uh now . Yeah , just draw it afterwards . <gap> Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing . I don't know . If you <disfmarker> Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ? Uh <disfmarker> Just save , save as ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven . Oh yeah , okay . Yeah . Smart board . Okay . Yeah , but this one . This one is not yet in the <disfmarker> Oh oh . I think it is . <gap> <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah , it is . No , I think it is . Uh untitled ? <gap> Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save . Okay . Uh all <vocalsound> the the seven , uh all the seven . But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . No , we are not extraordinary new or something . But not <disfmarker> No , just so it's still a two . Tha tha that <disfmarker> Mm two , I think . N Targeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ? <vocalsound> No , we we we searched for uh um <vocalsound> a young group , audience , beneath f forty . Yeah , but l younger than forty . Yes . So we we are exactly the targeted group . Yeah , but did we reach , um <vocalsound> with our uh style , the targeted audience ? Th that's my question . I think so , yeah . You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . Yeah . We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So So you want <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh <disfmarker> <gap> That's <gap> that's <gap> <vocalsound> That's this question . think that's a two or a one . Yeah , but s it <disfmarker> That's basically not not handy . And <vocalsound> I don't thi I don't see <disfmarker> Yeah , this . So we targeted it ? <vocalsound> Yeah . But we didn't follow the latest trends . Yeah . <vocalsound> No . Yeah , you could make a a front Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . a front that's that's like uh like a banana , <vocalsound> or something . Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh <vocalsound> get on my computer . Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . Yeah , you get different colours . You can different front uh <disfmarker> Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Like a a f banana kind of front . Oh yeah . But spongy will never be . <vocalsound> No . So we give ourself a three or something . Yeah . <gap> Oh . Okay . So that's eleven . That's uh <disfmarker> What's the average ? <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> Eleven divided by six . Yeah , it is one point eight three . A perfect score . <vocalsound> No , I don't know . We're not too hard on ourselves . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . Okay . And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . Okay . To call . Um <disfmarker> Oh yeah , that's still <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Call <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . Okay . That's <disfmarker> Yeah , but it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No no , I want that in . <vocalsound> But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . <vocalsound> No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . If you do uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ? Yeah , okay . It's <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> So I just got a financial um <disfmarker> Yes uh . <gap> You s <vocalsound> saved it or <disfmarker> Yeah . I did save it . No . Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me . It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . <vocalsound> Mm <vocalsound> okay . <vocalsound> That's fine . But uh is uh uh <disfmarker> So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . Okay . So that's both . Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three . Yeah , and single curved curved . But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or <disfmarker> No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be <gap> . Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , we can uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Probably . I just <disfmarker> The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . I'm not sure . See it's <disfmarker> I think it's okay like this . Special form , yeah . <vocalsound> It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um <disfmarker> Yeah , <gap> okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . Yeah . We get different ones , that's all . So you can put a recharger in it as well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But this is expensive , the sample speaker . Yeah . This ? Yeah . Yeah , it's four . Four . It's four Euros . Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or Yeah . <vocalsound> So we are <disfmarker> Yeah , that's included . It's kind of weird that we <vocalsound> we get this information now , afterwards . Okay , then we then we need to use it . Because <disfmarker> Yeah , no . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this <gap> . Damn , solar cells are uh expensive . So <gap> I just want you <disfmarker> Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . Okay . Okay . We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ? Sure . Yes . Okay . <vocalsound> Paul , was there room for crea creativity ? <vocalsound> Beautiful . <vocalsound> Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh <gap> already . So <disfmarker> Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity Yeah . Or a different style . then there <vocalsound> we probably have been creative . I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . Yeah . <vocalsound> So it's creativity . Huh . Okay , so the leadership <disfmarker> Was there a leadership and <disfmarker> Of course there was . <vocalsound> Okay . What do you have to say about that ? No , I think <disfmarker> Who was the leader ? <vocalsound> Yeah . I dunno . <vocalsound> Just normal discussion , I think . Not Yeah . <gap> one leader or something . One leader to check the time , etcetera . <vocalsound> Yeah . And make notes . <vocalsound> Yeah , I know . So more like a secretary . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , next one . Uh team work um <disfmarker> The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all <disfmarker> We were not um agree with every not agree with <gap> . Yeah yeah . We were not finished . Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just <disfmarker> We're not finished . Uh . Uh I think we <vocalsound> we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Yeah . Yeah . Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . Yeah , th that's weird . Yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would <gap> it . And then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We had to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Hmm hmm yeah . Yeah , finance . So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . Yeah . But the teamwork was okay . Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh <disfmarker> I think uh everyone listen to each other . Yeah . Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . Yeah . 'Kay . Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . Yeah . It was <disfmarker> Just doesn't work . No . Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . Digital pen or <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . Just not work too slow . Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think . Yeah , more accurate . Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate . Precise . Yeah . And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . Yeah . Not just pointing out on it . It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . Yeah . And so you've <disfmarker> Yeah , and p just point with a mouse . No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down . Yeah . Yeah . <gap> Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . Yeah . But you might as well do it in normal computer style . Yeah , like <gap> . Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style . Yeah . Yeah . And it's far too slow this way . Yeah . Okay . You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function . No . <gap> I think <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Digital pen . So we made it in time . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And we made a remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We did it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In the budget , yeah . New ideas found . New ideas . What's that ? Oh <disfmarker> For for for <disfmarker> I don't know what it mean . Just <disfmarker> I just think if we uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> To gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for <disfmarker> I dunno . For remote control probably . No , for the project . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> For remote control , a favourite for your text . <vocalsound> Hmm . No , for the prototype . New ideas . Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and <disfmarker> Yeah . But it's for the next team . Yeah , but it <disfmarker> You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think . We don't have to do that . That's for <gap> . Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the <disfmarker> Yeah , just brainstorming basically . Yeah . Details uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So are we finished ? Hmm . Yes , I think just <disfmarker> I just write a final report . Okay . Quite early . Yeah . No , we have only four minutes left . Uh it's okay . Oh okay . Oh , what do we have to do now . Do we uh <disfmarker> I thought we were done at four o'clock ? It's now quarter past three . So <disfmarker> Yep . <gap> I should take some pictures uh . Okay . Mm we can do it afterwards , so <disfmarker> Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Let's play minesweeper . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I found it as well . <vocalsound> Ti-din ti-din . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> One two three four five six seven cameras . <vocalsound> Mm not bad . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So that was it . Yeah . Now we can look at this . This is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We're probably not supposed to look at this , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The old versions . Yeah , from the previous group . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> They went for uh for a universal device . The touchscreen , yeah . Yeah , but also a different device <gap> . Yeah . Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy . Hmm . Here are the basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices . Yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . Hmm . I do agree with that . Yeah , tu-dum . English is not so hard by the way . No . I'm breaking a world record here . Well , leader ? Oh shit . Project Manager ? <vocalsound> We've got a problem , Paul . You do ? Yeah , you have to make a choice . Yes . No it's your choice . Wow , that's pretty quick . Tu-dum . <vocalsound> Uh uh um <disfmarker> Just pick one . You have to decide . It's the lower one . What's this ? A bomb or not a bo No no , the upper one is the bomb . This the bomb ? Yes . <vocalsound> Wrong . Shit . I knew it . <vocalsound> I knew it . <vocalsound> Four in a row . No . <vocalsound> That's too much work . Uh . <vocalsound> Come on . Is that previous work ? Yeah , this one . I challenge you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , that's so stupid . No , that doesn't work . No , you gotta use the magic pen . Hmm . What if I put one there ? That's stupid . We'll see . Okay . I don't agree . Mm . <vocalsound> Sorry . Yeah , you had two choices . That's gonna be draw . Or not . Hmm . Too bad . I'll put it here . Yeah , then I put it there . You are going to put it there . <vocalsound> No one wins . It's a difficult choice , either here or there . This is a very interesting design . <gap> <vocalsound> Ugly . It's just the same as normal . Oh <gap> a pen . Well it has a L_C_D_ , I think . Yeah , but <disfmarker> Okay . Then do it correctly . <vocalsound> Stupid design . Stupid . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> And what else do we have ? Stupid , the L_C_D_ screen . 'Kay wait , I'm going to draw something and you must y <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What ? Okay , I'm going to guess what you're drawing . Okay , blank . No no , the new one . Oh . <gap> Uh they just don't save it . Um <disfmarker> I know uh . A house ? Yeah , you have to use the pen s stupid . You have to save everything , you know that , huh ? <vocalsound> No , not everything . Oh . Yeah , everything . Pen , select select pen . Pen . It wants to know what we do in our spare time . Okay . It's a house . A plant ? No , it's <vocalsound> Only you can know it . <vocalsound> Oh yeah , I can know it . It's a <disfmarker> It's uh very hard to draw . <vocalsound> Okay , that makes it easier . I think I know . No , wrong . Mm . I think I know what you're trying to draw , but it's wrong already . It's <vocalsound> very <disfmarker> Yeah , you missed the right side . Fuck . F <vocalsound> No , you're wrong , you're wrong <vocalsound> A little bit maybe , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> See where you're wrong now ? The entrance . <vocalsound> Yeah . Warning . Finish meeting now . Alright . Okay , the entrance is uh more to the left . Warning . Warning . You're correct . Okay . But but but I think this part <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh no you <vocalsound> made another mistake . <vocalsound> Oh . Yeah , there are a lot of mistakes , because the walls are thick like this . No I w Okay , I'm not that whiny . But uh there was a big hole here as well , and there as well . Oh , that's true . Uh here . Yeah , they're walking behind the walls . That's a kinda big mistake . <vocalsound> Warning , finish meeting now . Guys , I think we have to finish the meeting . Okay . 'Kay this is a hard one . Uh ? Boom-boa-ring-bing . What does it say ? Fill in the questionnaire . What now ? Come on . <vocalsound> Okay , yeah . Okay . Yep . Okay . No more chit-chat . Oh you gotta finish Che-che-che-che . over there ? Yeah . In your own room ? Tu-dumm . <vocalsound> I'm gonna be so lonely . Uh . Mm I'll clean that up later . <vocalsound> This is <disfmarker> That's my new interface . What's that ? That's a uh edited smiley . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Tom-ti-dom . Uh . Okay .
Oh right okay . <vocalsound> I cover myself up . <vocalsound> I feel like Madonna with one of these on . I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've always wanted one of these , I really have . <vocalsound> Where do you buy 'em from ? <vocalsound> They're <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Hello everybody . Hello . <gap> . Back again for another wonderful meeting . <vocalsound> Is uh everyone ready ? Yeah . Yeah . Almost . <vocalsound> Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute . <vocalsound> Oh my gosh . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm 'kay . Are you ready ? Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . <vocalsound> Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um <vocalsound> which was we got together just to basically decide on <disfmarker> well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , <vocalsound> and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . <vocalsound> Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , <vocalsound> whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . Hmm . <vocalsound> Do you have any preference uh of order ? Um I'd like to um hear <vocalsound> o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want <disfmarker> what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and <vocalsound> Batteries . I think she is still finishing her <gap> . <vocalsound> No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing . It's just that <disfmarker> yeah , let's let's hear from you first . Hmm . Okay . Where is that thing ? Okay , it's uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It's here . Oh sorry , couldn't see . <vocalsound> Would that work ? Get yourself in position . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so that's me again . Ah . <vocalsound> Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is <disfmarker> which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of <disfmarker> which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v I don't think any of us remember the fifties . Is it like a crank thing or something <gap> . yeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy . <vocalsound> You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that <disfmarker> it will give it the energy to work . Mm . Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but <disfmarker> Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with <disfmarker> but also using some solar power . Yeah . Do <gap> sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? Mm . I dunno actually . Does anybody know ? Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . I dunno . Um . Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . Okay . Mm . And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that . Mm . Okay , jolly good . <vocalsound> For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so <disfmarker> What's a double curved one ? You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . So <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where <disfmarker> for example titanium , you can't use it for <disfmarker> if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh <disfmarker> So that might be an idea of using the rubber , Yeah . but then it should , you know <disfmarker> Let's have a squeezable remote . <vocalsound> yeah . Yeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , I dunno <disfmarker> <gap> when a T_V_ programme's got one <gap> <vocalsound> watching the match and <gap> your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , I like that idea . Mm . So rubber would be <disfmarker> Okay . I think rubber's <disfmarker> Rubber , we're all we're all going <disfmarker> we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ? But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more <disfmarker> Uh s so if d Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . <vocalsound> People . <vocalsound> okay . And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . Um scroll buttons , as well . Uh-huh . So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . So it's a constraint . Well , we're gonna go with <gap> I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so <disfmarker> Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? <vocalsound> If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . If that makes sense . <gap> push buttons instead of the wheel ? Yeah . <gap> . If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , <gap> it doesn't matter if it's double <disfmarker> I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double <disfmarker> rubber double curved case ? <vocalsound> <gap> rubble double double . <vocalsound> No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , I'll have a Big Mac , please . <vocalsound> then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it <disfmarker> if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go <disfmarker> I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . Okay . So , either <disfmarker> I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way . Let's go crazy . <vocalsound> And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be <disfmarker> so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . Yeah . Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . <vocalsound> Simple , yeah . Chip on print . It's a bit <gap> . <vocalsound> Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here Mm . <vocalsound> is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? <gap> . Yeah . <vocalsound> The infra-red . Yeah . Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? <vocalsound> Y um <vocalsound> what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so it sounds <disfmarker> Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . <vocalsound> So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . <vocalsound> I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . Fo It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . Totally . Yeah . Um we wanna go for an i i all <vocalsound> So let's not go for the <disfmarker> so long as it works , Yeah , yeah . I agree . you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . Yeah . S yeah , push buttons . What about the just developed uh sample sensor ? I think push-buttons is <disfmarker> What about what ? G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . Well <disfmarker> Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? Mm , I dunno . Be cool . It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , <vocalsound> Channel two . <vocalsound> Yeah . I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and <disfmarker> S Th the the <vocalsound> speech recognition um option is <disfmarker> it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , Yeah . 'cause uh <disfmarker> It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um <disfmarker> That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . Yeah . <vocalsound> But , I mean , it's not <disfmarker> it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns <disfmarker> comes on , Hm . but it's not that . It just gives you Oh , it just gives an answer . a it just gives you a verbal response . So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? <vocalsound> Oh , then then <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I thought I thought it was <disfmarker> when they said <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Just if you are really lonely , maybe . <vocalsound> Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's <disfmarker> I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , Channel five . And then it switches on . channel five , and it will change . No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ? Yeah . It it's just a remote that talks to you . <vocalsound> Uh . <vocalsound> I mean to certain cues . Oh , then <gap> forget about it . Yeah . Yeah . Oh right okay . Yeah . Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the <disfmarker> 'Kay . Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery . Basic battery . Mm . It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . Hmm . Cheaper option . Are you happy with that ? Mm . Yeah . Okay . So we'll go for the battery . Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved . <vocalsound> The the <gap> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> So it will look like something like this . Double ? The double whopper , please . Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , Yep , but <disfmarker> we're going for the simple buttons . So rubber rubber keys , yeah . Yeah . and that's fine ? And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it P Yeah . as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ <disfmarker> people were getting the <disfmarker> complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . <gap> . Yeah . Yeah . So that's another marketing point that we can use . Well the rubber push-buttons <gap> . Don't you have to move your <disfmarker> But anything is gonna have buttons . Mm . Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> You see , you can still get <disfmarker> it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . That they don't . <vocalsound> It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same <disfmarker> doing the same movement . <gap> . Mm . It's not actually what you are doing . <vocalsound> But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah , the rubber's good . Yeah . We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , so they can sit there and go like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports . <vocalsound> Alright , that's me done . Alright . Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's <disfmarker> the interface . Alright . Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . Great . Sorry . Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Mm . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . <vocalsound> I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless . Mm . Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh <disfmarker> they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . Mm . Mm . Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . Yeah . Mm . That does get annoying . Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have <gap> lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or <gap> , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . Mm-hmm . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . Uh <gap> um <disfmarker> Yeah . So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button <gap> in our last <disfmarker> I can give you an example here of uh , <gap> good layout and bad layout <vocalsound> uh from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh Yeah . Yeah . it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . Do we have an uh example of a good one ? <gap> <vocalsound> Brilliant . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And for <disfmarker> something for kids . Yeah . Um . Yeah . And so , yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of <disfmarker> we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . Mm-hmm . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me . Okay . Well let's um <disfmarker> so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The um <disfmarker> The the um the interface type we're going for <disfmarker> So we're <disfmarker> we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um . I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . Yeah . Yeah . Uh . And some sort of <disfmarker> it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . Yeah . I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . Okay , and we're not <disfmarker> yeah . Well now that we've decided on our <disfmarker> <gap> Are we gonna hav hav <disfmarker> an <disfmarker> are we d <vocalsound> have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something <disfmarker> Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , We're <disfmarker> Maybe we can <disfmarker> but um <disfmarker> Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey . Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this . Let's move over to <disfmarker> I I guess <vocalsound> the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . Yeah , sure . <gap> . But I think that should be <disfmarker> I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah . So that should be simple . Cool . Right . Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets Mm yeah . and what the fashions are for next year . Um . So yes <vocalsound> , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions Mm-hmm . and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market <vocalsound> these are like most important aspects like that we really need to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> which we've already probably discussed . Um <vocalsound> the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already <disfmarker> that we already have . So it has to be <disfmarker> Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? Yep . Exactly . Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So <disfmarker> What's that mean ? <vocalsound> Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work . Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , Should <disfmarker> I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . That's new . Okay , Yeah . now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . Yeah . Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , Yeah . 'cause our rubber one is not fancy <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we <disfmarker> maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either . So , <gap> no loose <disfmarker> Maybe we could um <disfmarker> Mm . That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is <vocalsound> , like people <disfmarker> and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . Of course , they do . Well , they do , but it's like it's not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . Yeah , but it looks good . If it looks good and it's <disfmarker> it can just be there for decoration . <vocalsound> Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other But like <disfmarker> electronics ? Yeah , what <disfmarker> I don't understand what m You could always insert , yeah . Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , right ? Yeah , and it <disfmarker> this is just gonna <gap> <disfmarker> all this is being used for is your television . Yeah , but , I mean , people like <disfmarker> It would <disfmarker> that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , Well , if you're looking at <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if you <gap> looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . Well <disfmarker> does it ? That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect <disfmarker> for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . Things like that . No , that would be your telephone <gap> in with your television . Yeah , the <disfmarker> that wouldn't be the remote so much , No i <vocalsound> Yeah , I mean <disfmarker> No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to <disfmarker> and i Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . I with the television , yeah . <gap> I was just trying to find an advantage . Mm . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the <disfmarker> Well , it doesn't <disfmarker> An and there is no there is no such thing Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery <disfmarker> it could be something really really minor , you know , like <disfmarker> but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . Okay . If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and um just go creative . Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , this <disfmarker> that's that's very good . And then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again . <vocalsound> Change the batteries ever again . And and this is all tying in very nicely . <vocalsound> The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . <vocalsound> Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . <vocalsound> Yes , so can <disfmarker> I think , safety s But yeah , by the squeezing it the <disfmarker> Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating <disfmarker> like the energy generator . Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done . Yeah . Third most important aspect <vocalsound> uh is it's easy to use . <vocalsound> <gap> we're all about that . And I think we've all um worked that out . Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . <vocalsound> So next year people will be buying <vocalsound> , I found this really funny <vocalsound> , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , <vocalsound> Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . Yeah . Yeah . Rubber things . I wanna watch the pineapple channel . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is <disfmarker> <gap> . Well spongy , that's where <gap> . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there . Yeah , that's great for us . yeah , so we're in . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . And so personal <gap> what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . So yeah . Okay . <gap> . I had to say <disfmarker> So we're moving in the right direction like <disfmarker> Right . Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , Yeah . so through all that we've <disfmarker> we go we're <disfmarker> right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , <vocalsound> Yep . Yeah , that's great . that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can <disfmarker> as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries <vocalsound> , <vocalsound> Mm . and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . <vocalsound> No vegetables . <vocalsound> Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate <disfmarker> <gap> . <vocalsound> We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . Some sort . Uh-huh . Or <disfmarker> The power button could be like a big apple or something . Mm . <vocalsound> Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that . Yeah , this is true <gap> . <vocalsound> They don they don't own <vocalsound> all images of apples . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> sued the Beatles so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . <vocalsound> Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . <gap> . Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going <disfmarker> yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? Well <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I think , if it's rubber it needs to be I mean you said earlier on i <vocalsound> it should be funky . different . I think , it's <disfmarker> it should be <disfmarker> I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like <vocalsound> L keep it clean , keep it clean . <vocalsound> really different colours basically . Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , <vocalsound> what do you associate with the mate the material <vocalsound> that material ? <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um like I'm just thinking bright colours . Yeah . Bright natural colours , nothing too <disfmarker> Bright , but not too bright . <vocalsound> Bright , but too <disfmarker> not <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so <vocalsound> anybody can choo like like <gap> <disfmarker> Like the volume buttons should be the <disfmarker> all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? Mm . Yeah . And on the back of it have the logo . Okay , what <gap> ? Yeah . Sure . Why not ? Okay . The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having <disfmarker> Tha Yeah , I mean we <disfmarker> that's we we <disfmarker> I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is the remote control tomato . <vocalsound> I mean <vocalsound> what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . Like <disfmarker> and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . Yeah . Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and <disfmarker> Yeah . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> I'm gonna write that down . so it's rea it's quite <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> it's quite like um user friendly <vocalsound> and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like <gap> pink remote control for their room something . So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different <disfmarker> Yeah . so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> yeah . Mm . So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour <vocalsound> wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . So they also get to pick . Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , It's um <disfmarker> where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . Yeah . Mm . Mm . D you've got the <disfmarker> Although I'd be curious to see how many uh <disfmarker> You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . Right . Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , Mm . if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . Yeah . And produce less of the silly colours , maybe . Mm . <vocalsound> Okay . Alright . Well um , we'll <disfmarker> alright let's <disfmarker> what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um <vocalsound> is from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . Yep . Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know <disfmarker> come up with the the user interface design . Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . You won't be going off to your separate offices . Alright . Okay . Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . <vocalsound> Oh right . I think , yeah , it's gonna <vocalsound> you know , Mm . come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . Cool . Yeah . We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's <disfmarker> It is . you know now we can actually start , you know , s some sort of physical something or other . That sounds good . Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . <vocalsound> Evaluation . Um . <vocalsound> And I <vocalsound> will be uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> talking to the bosses , basically , and uh <vocalsound> f fielding off some more spam and uh Great . that's it really . Keeping things t well , uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . Um . Yeah , that's <disfmarker> This is this is uh good . So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . We definitely know how it's powered , Mm . we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . Mm . People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , Yeah . It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . Um . <gap> you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things <disfmarker> are there extra things this product have ? We'll look into this lock key Right . facility , although whether or not it happens , <vocalsound> or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into . Okay . I think that's um <disfmarker> well done everybody . Alright . Anyone have any uh any questions , everyone know what they're doing ? Yeah . <vocalsound> 'Cause if you don't , you'll <disfmarker> I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now . S This gives you all the details ? Okay . right well . Okay . It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . But um <vocalsound> I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together <disfmarker> so bef before you all disappear off just Okay , I'll stay in here . <gap> <vocalsound> um . <vocalsound> hold hold fire . Um . Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we really have a incentive to make this remote work . Yeah . Yeah . I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . I want a share in the space rocket . Did you <gap> see that this k that this company <gap> we've made a spaceship . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> . Yeah . <vocalsound> This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . Yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department . <vocalsound> <gap> . Well I I did notice looking at <disfmarker> I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . Yeah . I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious . Mm . R_R_ . Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's <disfmarker> doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . Mm . <vocalsound> That's true . And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ <vocalsound> <gap> have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it No . <vocalsound> Doesn't <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> I still want one . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Okay . Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting . Yeah . Uh <vocalsound> . Okay . Yeah . Right , well , I guess that's us . Yeah . It's not telling <disfmarker> it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . So maybe you should go back to your own offices . Okay . Right . Are we taking these off ? Yeah . Yeah , it says you two <disfmarker>
Uh 'kay . So <disfmarker> So so so . Put on your mic . <vocalsound> So you forgot how this works again ? Boss . Yep . <gap> Boss . Maybe . Maybe maybe maybe . Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , 'kay ? Yep . And here's the agenda for this meeting . Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . Looks cool . And then we're gonna evaluate it . <vocalsound> Bra <vocalsound> Then we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . <vocalsound> Hmm you knocked it up ? And uh yep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And <vocalsound> we're gonna evaluate the product and close . Got forty minutes to do this in . We should be fine . Let's try and keep this one on schedule . Alright . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Your thing is in <disfmarker> where is it ? Thi third third third . Is it in <disfmarker> Three , three . The end product thingy . Yeah . Who wants it ? Pedro can have it . <vocalsound> <gap> . I like <disfmarker> I'll help talk . <vocalsound> Um yeah so what we ended up with . Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , <vocalsound> someone forgot the <vocalsound> units there Unit price . yeah , uh unit price <disfmarker> unit production price cost thing . Um we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the <vocalsound> the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? Yeah . Scrolling through your favourites list . Oh okay okay . Zapping you know zapping . Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites . Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing <vocalsound> . And um yeah that was the result . Ah 'kay . <vocalsound> I like the the the the logo on there as well . It's very prominent <vocalsound> . It is very prominent . So this is the <disfmarker> So <vocalsound> here I'll give you the <disfmarker> so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . Um so the scroll bar is <disfmarker> or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . Okay . Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . This is the power button . Uh we have our um <vocalsound> we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ? This is the teletext . Start s the the start uh to to to The programme button , programme yeah . yeah the programme button . Ah , okay I see . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming <vocalsound> your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this <disfmarker> of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . So you can see that when it lays like this or like this <disfmarker> It's pretty cool . and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um <disfmarker> Is that <disfmarker> could that be easy to <disfmarker> for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it <disfmarker> Not helping <vocalsound> . yeah <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . You can feel it . Mm . Feels good . <vocalsound> I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . Yeah of course . Well this is clay <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah it's kinda cool . You have to reach a little bit don't you . Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . <vocalsound> These <disfmarker> this is a bit larger than it would be , but <disfmarker> It's cool . I'm impressed . Don't have no one to handle that . <vocalsound> Mm that's <disfmarker> And hold it so <vocalsound> <disfmarker> wh what's the marketing perspective ? oh that's <disfmarker> oh I like it . I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this . Yeah I think it's good . Good good good job . Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . Yeah . So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . Beep beep beep . <vocalsound> Uh pla <vocalsound> The locator function . I'm ha <vocalsound> Okay . It's great . That's great . It's a great feature . Um beep beep beep <vocalsound> Mm it's impressing . <vocalsound> Wicked isn't it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So let me get it , so <vocalsound> if I press this button <disfmarker> beep beep beep <vocalsound> I see . That's pretty cool . Hang on . beep beep beep <vocalsound> <vocalsound> be shut up . <vocalsound> So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Beep beep beep <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I plan to do that as well . okay . Um no no no tha that's alri <vocalsound> So the the two blue <disfmarker> are are those for the the it to charge off of <disfmarker> in ? Exactly that's exactly what those are for . Ah okay okay . And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , <vocalsound> is um <disfmarker> you could beep beep beep <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> it's the right shape isn't it ? it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so <disfmarker> But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , Mm . Right . 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides <gap> . So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but <disfmarker> Okay . Uh , I can see that . But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , Mm-hmm . hasn't it ? Yep I like . Good job . So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ? <vocalsound> No no . Oh no this is <vocalsound> just what we had to work with at the time . Okay . So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . The <disfmarker> hmm . <vocalsound> Careful . It came off . The scroll wheels , <gap> a problem with them not being sort of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I mean of course , I mean <disfmarker> I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . <vocalsound> My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . <vocalsound> Mm . You know some blend of silvers and blacks . <vocalsound> Beep beep beep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay enough of that . Well i it's cool guys . 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ? Yeah . Ja . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now now . <vocalsound> So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board . Have you ? Okay . Yeah yeah . So <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . Oh I see I see . I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , <vocalsound> and I think I've got this really strange cable . So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot . Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? <vocalsound> Nah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So what we had is we had the method . That's not how you spell method , is it ? No way . No A_ <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> So this doesn't go so fast this way . And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . And uh to me with this product we got uh <disfmarker> we got <vocalsound> basically three things to market . We've got the features , we have the uh characteristics , and we have the <vocalsound> I I don't know what we would call the other part <disfmarker> what we call you know the the <vocalsound> the corp corporate <disfmarker> Help me . The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . So the features I think <vocalsound> we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , It fell off . we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um Beep beep beep . <vocalsound> the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . Uh and the corporation , we're talking about <disfmarker> we're we're a new we're a new company . We're wanting to make a name for ourself . We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of <disfmarker> the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? That was something I would be interested in . Um so <vocalsound> yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . Um w Do you <disfmarker> would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction . But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh <disfmarker> there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c <vocalsound> one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my <disfmarker> but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . <vocalsound> Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . Hmm . You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after <vocalsound> <disfmarker> W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But uh <disfmarker> yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . Uh to me the only additions <disfmarker> Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less <disfmarker> b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . Yeah . Yep . Mm there's a risk of that . But anyway that's uh <disfmarker> Okay so we can talk about finance now . So I have a little spreadsheet for us where <disfmarker> I I was wondering , you <disfmarker> when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . <vocalsound> Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . Very co very colf colourful . <vocalsound> Now Oh . I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , <vocalsound> Uh-huh . equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . Uh-huh . Uh <vocalsound> and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . beep beep beep . <vocalsound> Can be made for <disfmarker> it sounded different that time <disfmarker> uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , Oh , sorry . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh an uh <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh do you think that's fair coming from a <disfmarker> m the manufacturing ? Yeah um I do think we that we we <vocalsound> uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , <gap> . so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . Okay . Yep . Okay . So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . And we and we have a single-curved uh <disfmarker> Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? Uh I think that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur I don't know whether that <vocalsound> . It's single-curved , You think ? Okay yeah . I'm <gap> convinced . But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? So we come <disfmarker> bring it down to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Fifteen point four . See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well hang on . Do don't speak so <disfmarker> Okay . it's in here , in that <vocalsound> w do we have any <disfmarker> we have special form don't we ? Yeah . Yeah we do . So that's <disfmarker> yeah . Ah . What do you know <vocalsound> . But the the the <disfmarker> we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th <vocalsound> Oh it's <vocalsound> a that's not very special , it's pretty <disfmarker> if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> O okay so we're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If th <vocalsound> . Push-button , scroll wheel , we're <disfmarker> basically we have uh th We don't <disfmarker> is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? It's a scroll . That's a scroll . Just a scroll ? It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? Uh no we just use it as a scroll . Ooh . Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros . It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . <vocalsound> It wasn't bad . Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> . We're wicked . Awesome . Okay so we're on to the <disfmarker> S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate <vocalsound> . Yeah . We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul <vocalsound> the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us <vocalsound> , and we can use that to tell <disfmarker> How's it going ? <vocalsound> Anyone got any thoughts ? What ? How how have we done today ? I think we did pretty well . Yeah . I think we did pretty well too . That looks pretty spectacular . No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . Any other chang uh thoughts ? Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? <vocalsound> That was mm-hmm <disfmarker> Is it the <gap> . Sh I think there was plenty of room . Yeah . I <vocalsound> I think we we ended up being quite creative there . We got a couple innovative i Yeah well we we we kinda broke <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Couple innovative ideas . we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , Mm . No . Mm-hmm . we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . Yeah . So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . Not every idea necessarily , Basically . it's still a remote control <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Uh no <vocalsound> yeah but <disfmarker> we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the uh <disfmarker> But I like <disfmarker> I mean when I say we have we had <disfmarker> I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is <disfmarker> we did it . 'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was Yep . I agree . Teamwork . Cohesive yeah . Synergy . Yes synergistic yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> There was a lot of synergy . <vocalsound> Teamwork , yeah he is uh . Yeah . What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . These cables suck <vocalsound> . Mm . Yeah , this falls off Yeah . and uh the white board worked really well without any pro Yep . And that's <disfmarker> Yeah . D you must have very long shirts . That's way far down lapel mic . Mm-mm , lapel . <vocalsound> Lapel lapel lapel <vocalsound> . Wha okay , oh , alright <vocalsound> . Lapel . That's almost a crotch <vocalsound> mi cr <vocalsound> That's it's down , it's quite close . <vocalsound> You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th <vocalsound> Keep it , keep it calm . <vocalsound> Oh dear oh dear <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Oh dear <vocalsound> . No more pizza for me <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . 'Cause this is <disfmarker> you were using it o upside down . Still that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's our boss <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . <vocalsound> I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're <disfmarker> that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , Use them like that . Pedro's right . but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . Pedro's right . I don't care . Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . <vocalsound> What new ideas have we found ? Oh wel New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or <disfmarker> what are we ta Well let's do both then . Uh for the product ? Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . Oh . Yeah we came up with quite a bit . Bunch of new ideas . And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more <disfmarker> Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . Yeah less sore on the ears . Well I I mean <disfmarker> Mm . clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , <vocalsound> but <vocalsound> I don't think that's the that's avoidable . Coulda been worse . Okay <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> Are the costs within the budget ? <vocalsound> Mm n <vocalsound> no . No . Nope . Oh hang on it really <disfmarker> that's something we <disfmarker> that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . No requirements are changed . We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good . <vocalsound> And the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . Is the project evaluated ? Mm I think so yeah , then celebration as it says . Hooray . <vocalsound> Okay . Free coke provided at the cafeteria . All right . Oh I don't know how that got there . Uh anyway . <vocalsound> Who wrote that one ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thank <vocalsound> So we need to close this meeting , Thanks guys . <vocalsound> yeah bravo . Congratulations . Cool . Good job guys . S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and <disfmarker> 'kay . Yeah , I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . Oh .
Okay . Oh , that's not gonna work . <vocalsound> Oh , alright . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Um alright . Uh , uh , um . I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . Go ahead . Okay . <vocalsound> I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . 'Kay . Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um <vocalsound> sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . That's about it . <vocalsound> Right . <vocalsound> I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm <disfmarker> I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . Yeah . And uh the detailed design <disfmarker> in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a <disfmarker> not only a electronics company but a fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use . <vocalsound> Um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um . And w uh <vocalsound> well um functional design um . Um do we have <disfmarker> um any ideas of of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just <disfmarker> you know , change channels is its main function . So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or <disfmarker> I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote 'Kay . for <disfmarker> could work on all sort of electrical products in in one person's house . Mm . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . 'Kay . I think they all work on the same prin principle as well Mm . sorta like <disfmarker> I don't actually know . <gap> But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ? I I think <disfmarker> yeah , yeah , r universal remote . Ye yeah . Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , Huh . <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ours too . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think we're all in the same boat here . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . Okay . Mm . So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . Ch So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh Like a tracking device ? <vocalsound> like a tracking device Oh you can get those key <disfmarker> or or like a a <disfmarker> well you could whistle or make a noise It makes a noise , and it'd beep . there's a button on the T_V_ that you press Mm , mm . Mm . Yeah . and <disfmarker> Right . 'Kay . Be good . So <disfmarker> Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . Yeah . Just long . Do we want <disfmarker> so they're kinda like long and rectangular . <vocalsound> Yeah . Do we want something crazy ? Black usually . You know , Yeah . we want something new that's gonna stand out . Lot more modern . I think so . A m a modern <disfmarker> so our remote should be <disfmarker> Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . <vocalsound> Maybe like user-friendly , like a little Yeah . you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . People <disfmarker> Mm . I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another <disfmarker> if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . 'Kay . Mm . Um . Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , Yeah . so there are always the <disfmarker> some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . Mm . What are we gonna build that thing out of ? How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? <vocalsound> Okay so <disfmarker> yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , Yeah . we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , Yeah . It could be cased on the outside then it <disfmarker> and t everything could be inside . 'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , um <disfmarker> So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um easy to find . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> What else <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal . It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . Mm . Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . 'Kay . That's more on the research end , but <disfmarker> the marketing . So marketing , you know , how <disfmarker> maybe uh marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing <vocalsound> remote control out there . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'Kay . 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . Ye Small . Right . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ? We want it to be a b a ball , <gap> I'd <disfmarker> I could draw sorta the ball idea . you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located . My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you <disfmarker> this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle <disfmarker> Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that <disfmarker> if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , <vocalsound> and then you'd have just sorta you you you know , your buttons . Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible . Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something <disfmarker> maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But yeah . Futuristic . <vocalsound> That was that was a sorta simple idea I had <vocalsound> Uh-huh . and then you know you could <gap> about <disfmarker> Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um <disfmarker> the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , Yeah . but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , Yeah . Maybe f yeah . take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Yeah , that's g that's a good idea . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem . Yeah . The idea <disfmarker> it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , <vocalsound> That's that's <vocalsound> interesting of course , that was just one idea though . but that's of course a weak point , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> How would we go about um making you know <disfmarker> getting rid of our weak points ? What <disfmarker> I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not to put you on the spot , <vocalsound> E No no , but <disfmarker> uh uh <vocalsound> . What did you say your title was again ? N n <vocalsound> Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , You're the the Industrial Designer . <vocalsound> so i b well , <vocalsound> the point is that <vocalsound> well maybe <disfmarker> I dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . Okay . As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . Well I I suppose that things become <gap> design . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But I mean i I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , <vocalsound> Yeah . maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . It's not new , it's not innovative , it's <disfmarker> you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , Yeah . it's it's stable um . 'Kay , I'll draw something . <vocalsound> So if <disfmarker> <vocalsound> What ? <vocalsound> no , go ahead . My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games Yeah . l so . But maybe <disfmarker> I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know . <vocalsound> That's my idea . I think definitely doing something different Yeah . is a good idea . Mm . I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like <vocalsound> suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . Something with a grip . Mm . Yeah . Yeah , with a grip . <vocalsound> Yeah . Because even <disfmarker> I suppose even with the ball It still might be hard to <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . Mm . So perhaps the the joystick <disfmarker> the the keyboard idea might work better . Like <disfmarker> yeah . But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , <vocalsound> True . Yeah . so maybe maybe we <disfmarker> It's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . Mm . I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . <vocalsound> That's fine . <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> You're the boss , you're <vocalsound> allowed to . Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small it <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . if it's small it probably looks better , but may not be th as functional . So for that there's <disfmarker> Okay , so So <disfmarker> unfortunately we've got about five minutes here <vocalsound> to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um . Let's see here . What if we had what if we had not only um <disfmarker> say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So you know um s so Yeah . it's easier to hold onto that way . Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part . So the grip is <disfmarker> No , that wouldn't work either um . But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , um and then <vocalsound> flat uh <disfmarker> And then we have the problem with the hinge . So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? Mm , that's true . <vocalsound> It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it's <disfmarker> don't make it too stable <vocalsound> uh . So we don't have it flip open . We just have a ball <disfmarker> But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . To the other design . Okay , so then we forget the ball . <vocalsound> It looks cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Looks cool though . <vocalsound> It looks cool , Yeah . but it's really not <disfmarker> it's not functional um . Uh <vocalsound> functional . So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um <disfmarker> Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you <vocalsound> had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way . Course then it's it's like the rectangular <vocalsound> again , only with a couple of jutting out points . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Right . Right . But it's one-handed um . Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , Mm . Yeah . right , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not <disfmarker> probably not get a get away from some longer design . Yeah . <vocalsound> Right . 'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . Yeah , You know , all that dif batteries <disfmarker> because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . right , and <disfmarker> Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? So that either way you're pointing it it would work . I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . More expensive and <disfmarker> yeah . Course you can do that . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Um <disfmarker> I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or <disfmarker> if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the <vocalsound> the buttons and stuff , True . but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , Put it <disfmarker> like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of <disfmarker> or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work . Even if you designed it <disfmarker> in some <disfmarker> in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , Yeah . <vocalsound> and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it . 'Kay . Sorry to interrupt , Um <disfmarker> but we have a warning to finish . Are we out of time ? Yeah . Mm . Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some <disfmarker> Are good ideas , what are not . Let's . Does it say <disfmarker> what does it say for n Obviously <disfmarker> it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think . Uh . Must finish now , so . T And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . Mm . Alright . Great . Okay . And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next <vocalsound> time around , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> be a little bit more prepared . And uh alright , good meeting . <vocalsound>
Okay we all all set ? Right . Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . So um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . Anything I've missed ? No . Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead . Uh-oh . This is it ? <vocalsound> Ninja Homer , made in Japan . <vocalsound> Um , there are a few changes we've made . Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , Okay . Mm . Mm-hmm . so instead we've um <disfmarker> this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm um button . Mm 'kay . Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use . Where are they ? Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? Ah , right . Okay 'cause <disfmarker> Great . So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say <disfmarker> Right . Okay . You know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , Right . whereas many <disfmarker> the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . Mm-hmm . Right , 'kay . Okay cool . It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . Okay Mm-hmm , Oh right okay . and what is this here ? Cool . That's a number pad . Okay so the number pad is <disfmarker> Where are we gonna have the slogan ? 'Kay , great . Um they're al along this <disfmarker> You know , just like right inside there . Yeah . Okay cool . You have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom . <vocalsound> Okay . 'Cause slogans are usually quite small , right , they're not like huge Mm . so they're s Yep . Say a button's about Okay . Looks good . say a button's about this size , right , Yep . so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger Mm-hmm . so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . <gap> Okay . Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . Plus maybe half o five Mm-hmm . About nine in total . six seven eight , Six , seven , eight , nine , ten . about yeah nine total . So we're talking about ten centimetres . That sounds good . Yeah . That would be good . Yep . So ten centimetres in height . Nine , ten . Yep . Okay um <vocalsound> . That'd be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be <disfmarker> that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there . Yeah . That's great and it's very bright as well . Mm . So um okay . Is it possible <disfmarker> uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . Is these are these the colours that <disfmarker> of production , or is this just what we had available ? Well I'm <disfmarker> We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . Right . Um <disfmarker> Okay so just <disfmarker> could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report . But um <vocalsound> this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh <disfmarker> it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . <vocalsound> Excuse me . Mm-hmm . Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen Sure . Okay . and you use this as a jog-dial . Okay so that's like an okay button , right . Mm-hmm . Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <vocalsound> I don't know . <vocalsound> Okay . How high is it ? No as in the height , but what about the width ? Yeah . Didn't put five centimetres . Oh oh like depth of the actual thing . Do we need five ? I don't think five is <disfmarker> Um . be about th three and a half . Okay . Something by there . Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . Yeah , yeah . Sure . So you can power on and off , Three and a half . what else can you do ? Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . Okay . Um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . Okay jog-dial for volume . And what else do you do with the jog-dial ? Mm-hmm . Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and <disfmarker> Contrast , brightness , Um yeah . yeah , and anything else ? Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn't actually go through and specify the <disfmarker> Well of the designers what are they ? Uh what can a T_V_ do ? Okay things like um brightness , contrast , Uh-huh . um maybe tuning the channels . Okay channel tuning . Um . That's a good one . What else ? Um the various inputs . Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having <disfmarker> you know which input do you have ? Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Okay auxiliary inputs . Mm-hmm , probably colour or sharpness . Um . Yep , colour , sharpness . Sharpness . Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . Mm-hmm . Okay what about uh sound settings ? Uh d can you change any of those at all ? Audio . Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . Um . <gap> the the balance hmm . Um . Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , Okay . and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . Mm-hmm . Okay , Mm 'kay . Yeah . is there anything else at all it can do ? That <disfmarker> 'cause that's that's fine . Just need to know so I can write it down . Okay um right I g I guess that's it , so we can now um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to Mm-hmm . um if we need to rethink anything at all . So um for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? The battery . Do we have kinetic as well ? No . No . Okay , Um . just battery . We need an <disfmarker> And that's because of cost restraints is it ? Yep . Yeah . Okay um what about the electronics here ? Yeah advanced chip . We need an advanced chip I think , yep . Advanced chip . Let me just confirm that . Yes I think so . Yep . Okay um the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ? Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing . Yeah . So we want double-curved ? Yep . Okay . Um . Plastic . Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber . Okay , Um . um and we wanted special colours didn't we ? Yep . So I'll have to put that <disfmarker> Oh no wait we <disfmarker> ho how many colours have we got there ? For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour . Just one colour , okay . 'Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . Okay Mm . so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? Yes . One and the L_C_ display . Okay and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? How many <disfmarker> Um we have um got some push buttons as well . Or even clear . We've got push buttons as well . Like uh oh wait 'Kay . so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay . So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . Uh-huh . I'm not sure if that counts but <disfmarker> Okay . Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . Okay . Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again . Four . You can see we're we're all very far beyond the <disfmarker> So w why are we arriving at the number four ? Where does the number four come from ? 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons . Okay right , so we're writing down four . So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less . <vocalsound> Okay . How about these ? Are we wanting them in <disfmarker> No . no they're just <disfmarker> is everything gonna be plastic ? Yep . Yep . Okay . So we're w w quite far over . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now we're gonna <disfmarker> something's gonna have to go . Um we're at sixteen point eight and <disfmarker> Uh how mm-hmm <disfmarker> how are we going to achieve this high-end product if <disfmarker> Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro , We only have very sparse <disfmarker> so let me see , what are we <disfmarker> Two point three ? I mean <disfmarker> Four point three no ? oh yes sorry , four point three . My maths is all out . Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . Yeah . And then where is the <disfmarker> How much would that save us ? How much would that save us ? That will only save you one . That is one . One . The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , um because when you do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well , Mm-hmm . so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing That's fair enough , yeah . so we may not need to <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , Mm-hmm . Okay so <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . which I think is a technically doable thing so <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . So w what's our reviewed suggestion ? <vocalsound> Um take away the L_C_ display ? Yep . And the advanced chip goes away as well . Mm-hmm . To be replaced with a Regular chip . regular chip . Yep . Mm-hmm . Okay . So what that means is that um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And so we've got point three to get rid of . Um and we ha where are the four <disfmarker> the four push buttons are where exactly now ? The twelve buttons that you see there <vocalsound> . Twelve buttons . That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so <disfmarker> Yeah . Functionally you're gonna have to intercept <disfmarker> So four is a good estimate for <disfmarker> Do you think ? Yeah , so you can't actually cut <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ? It <disfmarker> It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . Mm-hmm . Mm . Mm-hmm . Okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere . We just report that it has to be over budget <vocalsound> , Mm . <vocalsound> or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . No can do . Yeah we could just go with um <disfmarker> Yeah w Normal coloured buttons . Well do you want colour differentiation here ? No that's not the button we're talking about . Um <disfmarker> Oh yeah sorry yeah then . <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> the buttons only refer to the pad so <disfmarker> Right so <disfmarker> Should we take that off uh ? Ah . <vocalsound> Hey it's back to the original . That's it . Hmm . Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , Mm-hmm . so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . Mm . Okay , ach that's a shame . <vocalsound> Um right , so take away that completely ? Ah . And now we're under budget . So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I reckon <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ? Doesn't say so . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's a freebie . Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons . Yeah . Yeah that's a good idea . Just one ? Does that mean that one button has a special form or <disfmarker> I think <gap> there's just one button so Yeah okay . handy <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Well well there we go . So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now . So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing , which I think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . Um . Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? What do you mean by profile ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Sort of flat as possible . No . You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of <vocalsound> deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . Yeah . Yeah that's what I was thinking , to Sure , okay . We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah alright yeah fair enough . Okay , just thought I'd ask . So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , Mm-hmm . and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height . Right okay . Yeah . So just to well to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ? Yeah . Okay and then so height-wise <disfmarker> Hmm . How how tall do you envisage it being ? About that big ? Yeah it works , yeah . Two . About two centimetres , okay . Two's not very high at all though . Maybe a bit higher ? This is about this is about two . Slightly more than two , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . See , about that thick . Okay . Maybe closer to three even or two and a half . Ach , that is <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Okay we'll s we'll say two point five . Okay um so we have it within cost anyway . Um so yeah project evaluation is this point . Um . Mm-hmm . Right uh . Okay so can we close that ? This is what it's <disfmarker> the final spec that it's gonna be . Mm-hmm . Someone is gonna have to <disfmarker> yeah that's fine that's fine . Um it's probably just <disfmarker> I dunno if it's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that <disfmarker> I think that's something that's very hard to catch , Yeah . so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . Sure , okay . The the look and the colour is something which is cool , Yeah , alright . but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar Okay , sure . then um <disfmarker> because when you put it on the shelf <disfmarker> What about button shape ? Square buttons ? Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , Okay . Yeah . 'cause I think positioning is <disfmarker> we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of Sure . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . pad . Right um . So at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us I guess . Mm 'kay . Um , let me see uh <disfmarker> Do you want me to d um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ? <vocalsound> Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was <disfmarker> Maybe we should do the design evaluation first . Or <disfmarker> Yeah Evaluation . , yeah go for that first . I wasn't entirely sure what uh <disfmarker> who was supposed to be doing that , Okay . but y you go for it . Sure . Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint , <gap> Okay . I'll try and do it as quick as possible . Okay . Um , this is um <disfmarker> I'll just go over your head if that's okay . Yeah . I don't think you need the power , <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> What's that ? No , that's okay that's okay . I don't need the PowerPoint ? No , the power cord itself . Oh <gap> course , Yeah , yeah that's true . so then you have a bit more freedom to <disfmarker> Let me get that . A bit more . <vocalsound> Okay , You you still have your blue fingers . so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is it ? You killed a monster . <vocalsound> The idea is that I've set up <disfmarker> I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but <disfmarker> Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? Oh there it is . Yeah , okay great . Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um <disfmarker> sort of review where we stand with it . Okay , so um <disfmarker> So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , okay . Mm 'kay . So these i these i th are the <disfmarker> and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement . Okay . Okay ? So the first one uh , stylish look and feel . I rate that pretty highly . Well yeah , Yeah . I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . Yeah . I dunno like a six or something . Yeah . Yeah What does anybody else think ? um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour , Mm . and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit . Mm . But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . I'm seeing five then . What do you guys think ? I would say five or six . Okay . David ? Yep I'm fine with that . Okay let's go with five then . Okay . Fi oh uh just actually the opposite . It's one to seven , right ? The <disfmarker> Oh yes sorry then So it meant three , , then I would say two or three . okay . Wait , what's the scale , one to seven , right ? One's high-ish isn't it ? Yeah . Yeah , one is high . Ah , okay so yeah , two or three . 'Kay <vocalsound> Okay , it's upside-down . Let's go with two point five then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , um <vocalsound> control <disfmarker> high tech innovation . <vocalsound> Well it has the wee jog-dial We had to remove <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> Yeah , so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , Mm . but jog-dial 's good . I'd go with three or four , Say it's more Eight three . medium , maybe three . but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . Okay , Yeah about three , okay . three ? Yep . Okay , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . I shouldn't have said colour , but just <disfmarker> Lemon . Well that's kind of <disfmarker> Okay , the blue the blue colours and <disfmarker> don't re don't actually represent the colour , Yeah . Sorta . except for the b the the red button , Yeah . they <disfmarker> because for want of a <disfmarker> Okay . But the yellow , I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour , Right . Yeah , could be . Yeah . Yeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , couldn't it ? but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . Okay . Yeah . Okay so we'll go two . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah ? Okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features . Well yeah , I mean it's really basic looking F f yeah f fairly basic , isn't it ? I mean I'd give that nearly a one . you guys think ? Yeah <gap> one . Yep , that's fine . Yeah , one ? Okay . <vocalsound> Um , <vocalsound> soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . Yeah I think it's about five . Five ? Five ? <vocalsound> Yeah well we have to use uh plastic That's really low . so it's probably gonna be <disfmarker> Yeah I suppose mm 'kay . That's <disfmarker> Um Yeah , could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? company logo . Was that an option ? I think I'd probably increase the cost . I think it'll be cost prohibitive , We've only got <vocalsound> like what , ten cents left so <disfmarker> It would cost more than plastic . yeah . Okay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? Yep . Yep . Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there or something ? Huh . And um it's within budget , yep . It is , isn't it ? Yeah . Okay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible <disfmarker> or what would be our goal here ? Out of forty nine , I guess . Yeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . 'S pretty good . So it's pretty good . Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . Right ? Uh yeah . I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about Twice that , about thirty one , about thirty one . and then invert that , it's <disfmarker> So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah . Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent . It's pretty good . Okay , good . That was just a little formality for us to go through . Okay . Yep , oh hundred pound pen . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sorry <vocalsound> <vocalsound> alright . Nobody saw it , honestly . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> The cameras did . <vocalsound> Hmm . Is that you all have all finished , or <disfmarker> Yeah that's that's me . I did have one other um one other frame I thought , I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . Uh-huh . It's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , Yep . I dunno the <gap> <disfmarker> Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . Okay . It's just discussion . I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine . I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . Um , yep Right . so there . That's all . Okay , great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I ? I don't know what your instructions have been . Um , I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet . Yeah . Okay , uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes , <vocalsound> because if you're submitting it anyway then <disfmarker> I will , yeah . Okay great . It keeps getting too big . Cool . Um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . 'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well . <vocalsound> Oh right , okay . <vocalsound> Just in case you're wondering <vocalsound> , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ? <vocalsound> Huh . Just about right <vocalsound> L_E_G_O_ Lego <vocalsound> . <gap> My leg . <vocalsound> Right , okay . Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that . <vocalsound> You got a different uh <disfmarker> <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> Yep . I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . Oh yeah , they're good aren't they , yeah . It's really quick . Right okay , To use . um yeah here we are . Uh as a note we'll do this alphabetically . <vocalsound> Um do you wanna start Andrew ? Sure , um so what is it you're asking of me now ? I don't know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . Or sort of our work on setting this up . Yeah . Yeah . Well , is it <disfmarker> uh okay I'll just go through your system then . The the room uh is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , Uh-huh . whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? d debating <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . I think it means like you know <disfmarker> Oh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . Room . Oh yeah . <vocalsound> No , of course , yeah . Well I dunno do you th Sorry . I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so <disfmarker> Huh . Yeah . Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , Mm-hmm . but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours . Mm . So what do we do . We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , Okay . so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual <disfmarker> You feel like you're caged within whatever y Okay . Yeah within the constraints It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . The constraints do come in very fast . Okay uh do you know what , So <disfmarker> actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think . Yeah . Yeah . So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig . Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . Yeah . Yeah . Yep . I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , Yeah . so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . Yeah . Yeah . Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to <disfmarker> allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . Mm-hmm , Mm . mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing , Yeah . and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts <disfmarker> Yeah , sure . I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right Yeah . Yeah . it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . New creativity . I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . Yep . Right . So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or <disfmarker> Not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear Yeah , but actual environment ? yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um Mm . Mm-hmm . and and the time the time given also restricts <disfmarker> Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay . Very good . Um what about leadership ? <vocalsound> I don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something . I don't really know . <vocalsound> Yeah , well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement <disfmarker> From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ? Yeah from <disfmarker> and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader . Okay . Um yeah I think I think it's <vocalsound> Excuse me . I think it's good . I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and Mm-hmm . you know , innovative thought with . <vocalsound> In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your <disfmarker> the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a <vocalsound> quite a con confining framework to work within . And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so <disfmarker> Uh-huh , okay . But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free <disfmarker> So you think maybe a little too controlling or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . I think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured . Yeah maybe not co confining . I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Okay . I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . Uh-huh . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . It doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the <disfmarker> Mm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay , uh what about teamwork ? Um did , you wanna comment Craig ? Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . Yeah . Yeah . If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier . Yeah . Okay . Fully agree . I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . um it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you ? Yeah . Not just yet . Yeah . Oh that's alright . Yeah , got the email . I was wondering if that got there okay . Okay . Okay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . Yeah . Yeah , I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word . in it <disfmarker> Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , They don't support the team working together , you know , mm-hmm , Oh right , okay . exactly . Yeah , I mean if you <disfmarker> they're still very individual tools . Yeah , I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation Mm . I I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , but um We had Play-Doh fun <vocalsound> . yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it , Yeah . well that's what teamwork is . To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . Yeah . Okay . Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done . Okay . I'm not dissatisfied with it . Right , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ? No , not really . Okay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? Um did anybody think anything was like really useful , Mm-hmm . anything was pretty un f <vocalsound> unsupportive ? I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . Mm . Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss Mm-hmm . Yeah . And point at ? Yeah . and and and in a way everybody's <disfmarker> as we discuss things in the <disfmarker> in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just <disfmarker> we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . It wasn't until we had this here , you know , Yeah . like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book . Ah . But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um <disfmarker> So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? Think could be , yeah . I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , Yeah . Yeah , yeah . and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm . It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint , Mm-hmm . or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place , Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Okay . you know in the centre of the <disfmarker> Yeah , because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it , Alright . um 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we <disfmarker> what we were set up to to use while we had our time . Okay uh <disfmarker> I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings <vocalsound> . Mm-hmm . Yeah . 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent <disfmarker> we spent a lot of time doing that . Yeah . Yeah . And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually <disfmarker> it could have , we could have gone through it <gap> verbally , Yeah . No , not quite . especially my slides , Yeah . I felt that they just you know <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . as opposed to having to present them . Yeah . What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? <vocalsound> Yep clunky . <vocalsound> Sure , yeah . Oh they're a bit clunky . Agreed . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yep . Clunky , okay . Mm . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , <vocalsound> Mm . 'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . Yeah . I know , <vocalsound> Yeah . I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff , didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , Hmm . and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something , Hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . but they'll have my paper anyway um Hmm . and haven't done that since . But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't <gap> have to worry . Mm-hmm , Yeah , mm-hmm , So I think the pen's good . yeah . mm-hmm . <vocalsound> It's about the best thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . Yeah . It just occurred to me that they all <disfmarker> Yeah we only needed one computer and <disfmarker> We only actually needed one computer . Yeah , that's true . If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . Good point . And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> it's useful but <disfmarker> Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ? I think too many computers are just distracting . Yeah . Okay . Um <disfmarker> I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually , Mm-hmm . like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , Yep . Mm-hmm . Yep . Mm-hmm . um I don't know about anybody else . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . Um I don't know is <disfmarker> Is this for the project or <disfmarker> could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? Well , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . Mm . So , Yeah if we just had uh <disfmarker> that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about <disfmarker> Oh yeah . Yeah , yeah . The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there <disfmarker> maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um <vocalsound> yeah . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . just to have like something written down , Mm-hmm . just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but <disfmarker> There you go . Hmm . Um so in closing , I haven't got my five minutes to go . Thin Oh there it i <vocalsound> Five minutes to go . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wonderful . Okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . And is the project evaluated , yes it is . So now celebrate <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Great . So it <disfmarker> And we have Ninja Homer . So now we <disfmarker> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Well apparently now I write the final report . Do we know what the other ones are ? What are you guys doing now ? I I don't know . <vocalsound> You dunno ? Oh wow . <vocalsound> Hmm . That is lovely . <vocalsound> Hey yeah , I said Ninja Homer . <vocalsound> What did you call it ? Ninja Homer . See it looks like Homer Simpson Huh , huh . but it's electronic so it's made in Japan . So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? Logo . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah it's just a logo . Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer , Huh . Ninja Homer . <vocalsound> right okay . <vocalsound> Mm . The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . Mm-hmm . I think it's quite nice . Fashion technology or something . <gap> You can wear Homer , you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh . <vocalsound> Hmm , hmm , hmm . <vocalsound> Oh no , that's cool , it's got <disfmarker> I'm kind of <disfmarker> Hmm . It's clunky . I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , I think that would have been nice . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . Mm-hmm . Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . Hmm . <vocalsound> Play-Doh s No it is it is . It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . Huh . Huh . Really ? 'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . Did they ? You might wanna write that down . Yeah . It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool . Okay . Play-Doh . No , it's true , yeah . Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells . Hmm . Yeah , it smells funny doesn't it . Um <disfmarker> And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they ? No , all Play-Doh is edible . Yeah like the stuff for <gap> <disfmarker> I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . I think it has to be , yeah . It's just wheat , it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh <disfmarker> Wow , hmm . Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ? It's helpful to the creative process . Huh . Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . Okay . Yep . And it helps you to understand Taste . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> dimension as well . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , Yeah . whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of Yeah . Mm-hmm , yep . Yeah . Yeah it's not very tangible . Yeah . yeah <disfmarker> tangible , that's a nice word . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . It becomes tangible . Mm-hmm . Tangible . Okay uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss . Nope . That that's about it really . Just sit still I guess for a little while . Do we retreat to our , to continue our I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate . Um <disfmarker> r reporting or what i Well I dunno . Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now . <vocalsound> Can we turn off the microphones ? <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so .
Just put it on the deskt <gap> desktop . No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link . A well actually just there . Project documents , yeah . Yeah . That's it . If you dump it in there . What's your username ? Your username . What's your username and password ? Mm-hmm . Sorry . Okay . Okay . There we go . Excellent . Right . Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . So . Functional design meeting . We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . Not a lot thankfully to say . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Um . Now . Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . Mm . Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , 'Kay . to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . Sure . Um , sh would you like to <vocalsound> I'll just do it from here . Yep . Sorry . Uh . Is yours the <disfmarker> Um , try second one maybe . Try it , yeah maybe . Oh sorry . Yeah . Okay . Okay , right . Oh , I thought I put in my last name , I guess not , but <gap> . Uh if you <disfmarker> that's all right . Okay . <vocalsound> If you <disfmarker> do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ? Oh yeah , that'd be fine , that'd be great . Yeah ? Okay . Functional requirement by me Ebenezer . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . We asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people <vocalsound> fifteen people in each group . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> So we got <disfmarker> some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . <vocalsound> Most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . And if they do , not very often . Takes too long to master the remote control . I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . Some of the good stuff we got . Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . Now don't get excited yet , I've got more to say on that . Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Finally , my opinion . Yep . The voice recognition thing is cool . And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you can't have that many words . For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . I'm pretty sure people would buy it . But after a while people may wanna return it , because <vocalsound> if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . <vocalsound> However , <vocalsound> oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . See , you could <disfmarker> there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine . Okay , yep . So we have the three birds , we have the design , that <vocalsound> we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition's fancy , it's cool , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit I don't remember <vocalsound> so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . Um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . <vocalsound> And uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . Uh , will people return the remote control , <vocalsound> I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , Mm-hmm . If you could uh do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . So . These are things I think we should consider . I think it's cool , sor if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . I'm sorry ? If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah . Sure . I'm about to end , yeah . Sorry . Cool . I think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations . Okay . Excellent . So , yeah . Right . Um . Hear from the <vocalsound> User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea . Okay . Um , you've got your presentation now , <vocalsound> How did <disfmarker> where did <disfmarker> Yeah , is it on the <disfmarker> it's in the it's in the folder where did you get all your in information <gap> ? yeah . is it ? Okay . There was uh a website , uh , Oh . <vocalsound> Technical functions ? right here . Ah , okay . Mm . No . Yeah . Okay . Okay , this is a <vocalsound> brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I <vocalsound> had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance , so Okay . press on . I've looked at <vocalsound> looked at a num <vocalsound> uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . Um and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on . <vocalsound> Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . Um to save you getting off your backside . Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . On the one hand <disfmarker> and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what <vocalsound> what is most likely to get used . Um <vocalsound> With uh <disfmarker> a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . Um and if you <vocalsound> if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ <vocalsound> D_V_D_ or uh <vocalsound> V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . Um . My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . Um but uh the pro <vocalsound> I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from <vocalsound> want it to do most . So , something that's uh <vocalsound> something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . Um so that those are then immediately <vocalsound> accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp <vocalsound> you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's <vocalsound> going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . Um , this is actually <gap> a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , Mm . you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the <vocalsound> and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . And so it's taking taking the lead from that . Um . Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> That's it . Right . Um , if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer . Yeah . Uh , I was still working on stuff , I hadn't got it finished . Um , <vocalsound> alright . Click to save in <disfmarker> where do I have to save it ? If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . If you save it in there we can open it up from here . <vocalsound> Um , what I've done with it , I'm sorry . Shit . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Are you finding it okay or ? I'm just <gap> closing it now . <gap> where I've saved it . Well like if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working <disfmarker> <gap> that's it there , yeah . yeah , and you just click file save as . Oh right . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh , right I'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen . Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . So uh uh , if you go to next slide , you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . Do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . Um , <vocalsound> , or would that take too much power , would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? Um , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> , so uh we need to <disfmarker> I dunno exactly what <disfmarker> That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design , um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . Okay . So , that'll be decided , I guess . <vocalsound> Uh , and the next slide . Oh , yeah <disfmarker> Um , if you go to the next slide then . Oh . <vocalsound> Yeah . I just used the <vocalsound> it was a mess , uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there . Uh <disfmarker> Ah , don't worry about it at all mate . <vocalsound> Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything . You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . Uh , so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? Um , I dunno what we should decide on that . Okay . Well . Oh sorry , I'm I'm interrupting you . Are you <disfmarker> is it <disfmarker> No , it's finished , yeah . yeah ? Okay . Right . Um , <vocalsound> right we can probably skip that for now . So , we've had some stuff put forward , um along with the new user requirements , um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about <vocalsound> um voice activated control . However I've got a couple of worries about that . <vocalsound> The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . Cost . Mm . Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , Mm-hmm . but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . 'Kay . Um that's just my view right now , Mm . <vocalsound> however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , Mm . but it might be quite low ? L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or <vocalsound> uh , interactive L_C_D_ or <disfmarker> I uh <disfmarker> Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a <vocalsound> a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , Mm . traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . Mm-hmm . That could be one possibility . Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels <disfmarker> Mm . <gap> I I was thinking that the remote <vocalsound> the um <vocalsound> sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels . We <disfmarker> Do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ? Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it Yeah . um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing , um . Mm . And I think <vocalsound> and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind . Um though I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white . <vocalsound> I would agree with you . Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> won't we . It does nothing extra . That would be my feeling as well , I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . Um now I mean Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or <disfmarker> and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one , I don't <disfmarker> sorry , go for it . but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are <disfmarker> niche are we trying to market and corner . You know , you know what I'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ? Everybody ? <vocalsound> I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . Most people , yeah . Um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . Mm . Mm-hmm . But that does cover a very large section of the people out there . Sure . I think that's fair <vocalsound> yeah . Um , I mean Mm . I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . Mm-hmm . Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . Mm-hmm . So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ Mm-hmm . and who would normally use the unit . Mm-hmm . Mm . <vocalsound> I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick I dunno . is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put um I mean there are <disfmarker> like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . Um . Mm-hmm . But uh but the <vocalsound> but then o uh obviously if uh you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i <vocalsound> you you then get to sort of menu navigation . I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and <vocalsound> fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra <gap> Mm-hmm . integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling . Um <gap> concern about our market . Um , if we are I mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of <gap> remote control rationalisation . Um , you've got twenty different devices in your living room , Yeah . Mm-hmm . you want one wo <vocalsound> y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . Mm-hmm . Um , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else . I just think that uh possibly <disfmarker> Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid , mm . this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on . Mm . So um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . Mm . So I can understand your point , and I would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . 'Fraid to say . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Does that um would that include um access to say <vocalsound> interactive functions on digital or cable ? <vocalsound> Yeah . I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . Um I think that it <disfmarker> I would say that the design spec we've been <gap> with is for the television only for now . Mm-hmm . And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that . Hmm . Okay , specifically television . Okay . Okay . Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now <disfmarker> So the joystick is just for differentness . Mm . It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . Um <disfmarker> Okay . Just a thought . <vocalsound> Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers , rather than the public . Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um <disfmarker> There is that possibility , yes . B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , Mm . <vocalsound> that might be sales , Mm-hmm . who are not in this meeting . It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , Mm-hmm . not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . Mm-hmm . We just <disfmarker> Is this gonna be enough to to sell ? Well , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , in fact we've probably all done . Yeah . Um , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you <disfmarker> tell you where it is . I had one of those , Mm , yeah , I've seen them . and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up Um . Well because it it went off all the time accidentally . the other option of course is that um the The clapping one . <vocalsound> well <disfmarker> I was going to say clapping , um <disfmarker> Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has <disfmarker> of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . To a television . <vocalsound> Mm . Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . Yeah . And that could be something could um separate us a bit . Yeah , I think that's a good idea . Yeah , that's a good idea . And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't <disfmarker> power <gap> that might be something that we could look into . Yeah <vocalsound> Yep . Yeah , it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . <vocalsound> I think so , yeah . <vocalsound> So . To go on from here . Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going <disfmarker> this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique . Do we go for maybe a remote contro Mm . uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ . Mm yeah . We're just saying volume . Yeah , I think that's <disfmarker> Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? We could use say the left and right for changing channels Yeah . and the up and down for volume , For volume . Yep . But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . and <disfmarker> Okay . Um , power is used like once per hour , I channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , Mm-hmm . that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen , Vol Volume selection okay , yep , and volume selection . the teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo <disfmarker> No , yeah , okay okay . Yeah , um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> So we <disfmarker> well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? So we're having very very few buttons involved , Actually how <disfmarker> but navigation around a menu for most things . Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the <disfmarker> y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . Okay . Okay . Or vice versa . And that's really irritating . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb . Okay . So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? Yeah , think so . <vocalsound> Do you mind looking <gap> ? Um , I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that <disfmarker> The ability to locate it again . Yeah . So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and <vocalsound> what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . Light bulb as well , Oh . So <vocalsound> so no ? Sorry ? a small speaker you mean . Speaker <vocalsound> Some speaker , sorry , yeah . yeah . And a light bulb ? No . To flash . No . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it . <vocalsound> E us we might be better with the sound possibly <disfmarker> W Yeah . we could maybe incorporate those little key-rings have both , so <disfmarker> th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . Yeah . Yeah . The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um . <vocalsound> So Blue ones particularly . Plus that's a nice wee design touch . Yeah . by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . Because we're only going to have a very few key Mm-hmm . and you've got you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . Mm-hmm . Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such . Ebenezer , um , Marketing Expert <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right . You want the stuff <gap> . If , yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , Okay . and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . Okay . I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame , but could be something we could maybe look into . Mm-hmm . Sure . Sure . Okay . Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? Anything that they think has been missed out . Bit of a wide open question there of course . Mm . Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . Sure . 'Kay . Yeah . Right . So I should just look at um the speaker , <gap> the speaker and an L_E_D_ . <vocalsound> And <disfmarker> Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , um , Yeah , Transmitter <gap> . and a transmitter . transmitter <disfmarker> Actually one one wee thought about that . Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . <gap> getting the external power source , yep , that's quite true . Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say . Yeah . The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , Mm-hmm . so that's good . Mm-hmm . 'Kay . <vocalsound> You know I think P I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . Quite quickly . Oh , one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , my apologies for that , um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , um it's , Fashion . I'm pointing at my laptop , what in God <disfmarker> Real reaction , and such . So um <disfmarker> The slogan is <disfmarker> yeah , Oh , sorry . the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , isn't it ? My apologies . No it could well be , I've probably missed that . Um , I think that's l almost the last minute thing 'S also look cool . we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . Mm . But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? In fact we might like to put a slogan on , Mm-hmm . and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company . Rather than real reaction . Mm-hmm . Mm . Yeah . I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button . Sounds good . And I'd say that that's us for now . <gap> . Okay .
So <disfmarker> Hello . <vocalsound> Good afternoon . Sorry I'm a little late . No problem . Got stuck in the traffic . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting . There he is . Yes . Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda . We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . <vocalsound> Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , <vocalsound> and the closing after that . We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um we will do the <disfmarker> this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward . Okay . Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors . Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . Then there's the zero to <disfmarker> one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it . Okay . Um , <vocalsound> is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? So <disfmarker> Sure Yeah . Yeah . uh just pop in at any time . Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh <disfmarker> So um <disfmarker> You put it uh <disfmarker> you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . Mm-hmm . And you <disfmarker> But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel . S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . Oh yeah ? But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . So I'm wondering if we if we neely <disfmarker> really need all of those buttons . <vocalsound> I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . <vocalsound> That's right . And well Yeah . the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one . Yeah . Yeah . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those . Yeah . The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary Yeah yeah . because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . Mm . Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh <disfmarker> Long time . Yeah . Yeah . If you put <disfmarker> But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put <vocalsound> press uh the button and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Well , <vocalsound> you can't leave out the number buttons I guess . And uh <disfmarker> Yeah . And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . Yeah . Oh . Yeah . Okay . So it's rather basic already . Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . Yeah . Yep . Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? Yeah , they're <disfmarker> It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . Yeah . Yeah , Just n normal plain buttons . it <disfmarker> But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Yeah yeah . Yeah . 'Kay . Just to recognise it , so uh <disfmarker> Just for recognition . Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um <disfmarker> Y uh No . s some uh remote controls uh do it also , No . but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . Nay . Yep . So they jump out . Okay . And uh that's about it . That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . <vocalsound> Mm . If we see <disfmarker> I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible . Since it rechargeable . It's rechargeable . That's right . Yeah we can u just uh <gap> <disfmarker> Okay . That's two Euros off . <vocalsound> 'Kay . <vocalsound> We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh <vocalsound> to save there . Yep . <vocalsound> Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um , Mm . I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . Yeah . Yes . I think we have to keep that . Yeah . Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons . So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Okay . Yeah . Because you have to <disfmarker> we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um , so if we <disfmarker> Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Uh <disfmarker> Sixteen , I believe so . Because I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros . So , Uh seventeen . Uh with the help button . seventeen . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , including the help ? Yep . Damn . Yeah . Yeah . Uh seventeen . <vocalsound> I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number long . <gap> . Yep . That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ? Yeah . Wouldn't <disfmarker> Yeah . Fifteen buttons . No . That wouldn't be an option . And this is <disfmarker> Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ? No those are one , I think . Yeah . Well , think actually there're two buttons , Where did uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , it's just one button . aren't they ? But , um <disfmarker> Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah but th it's not stated in this files . It's just a <gap> . So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . That's possibility as well . That would cut the cost . So <disfmarker> And it's good for the design as well . So you can make <disfmarker> Uh let's see . If you make this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Looks a bit like uh a cross . <vocalsound> Plus . Min . But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . Uh s yeah channel . So uh , Yeah we've still got four buttons , w but just um <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Yeah th I think they count uh the materials . You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um <disfmarker> Yeah on the chip there . Yeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . That's right . That's right . So <disfmarker> Yeah . But I think because we have the advanced chip Yeah , <vocalsound> But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> we can just count this as one button . But <disfmarker> No but I think <disfmarker> Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . Yes . Uh that's that's a big cost . I think they uh try t If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? <vocalsound> Only the docking station , I guess . Yeah . Which isn't the <disfmarker> the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . No . So it's not even taken into the price . That's extra . <vocalsound> That's extra . That's right . Maybe we should to a different supplier . <vocalsound> That's an option . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Poland . Something . <vocalsound> Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . <vocalsound> We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? <gap> . Yeah , that's what I'm wondering . <vocalsound> My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message . So <disfmarker> Yeah . That's a point . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? So um <disfmarker> Yeah . We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or <disfmarker> Can't uh go um <disfmarker> Yep . Yeah . No . Well , since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features . Nay . Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it . The margin will get too small . Yeah . Is it impossible to <disfmarker> Yeah . So <disfmarker> But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty . I don't think so . It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say <disfmarker> Or you can take the single chip . It would be a be a pretty rigid one . S Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ten . But , you can't use uh <disfmarker> There it is . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> But then w Good looking . Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh attractive uh o options . Yeah . So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So <disfmarker> I think it's uh difficult as well , Or b but <disfmarker> Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . No remote . <vocalsound> Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . Scroll-wheel's one . <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> Then w Because then we save ten buttons . No , it <disfmarker> Then we have five and one . Yeah . And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced <disfmarker> W uh , we're getting close . <vocalsound> We're getting closer . Yeah . <vocalsound> But how does scroll-wheel work here ? Then you will <disfmarker> Or maybe you can um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it . Yeah . That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . Mm . Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well . But <disfmarker> Yeah . You could just not scroll for a half a second . Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . So you won't need a button . I think that would be like the end of our usability . <vocalsound> But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . D <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And we need the battery . <vocalsound> And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ? If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes . It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . Hmm . And we can save a Euro by a flat design . That's an option we can <disfmarker> Yep . Ja ja . Then we're almost there . Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button . Yeah . So if we <disfmarker> Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button . Yeah . Yeah but I think that's <disfmarker> That is a big advantage , So <disfmarker> Yeah <disfmarker> if we're <disfmarker> Yeah it's a big advantage . But um , it's <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Can we use <disfmarker> can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? I think so . Yeah . Uh , yeah . Well , If you push it three times ? think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are Yeah . right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , Yeah . and teletext disappears . Yeah . But the subtitles stay there . <gap> <disfmarker> But if you push the teletext button twice <disfmarker> I think that's the case on most <disfmarker> <vocalsound> What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . <vocalsound> It's uh <disfmarker> One m uh one b uh , a few buttons . Ah that's not really that <disfmarker> Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . Yeah . Okay . But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . No . Yeah . Holding a remote with <vocalsound> which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . No . <vocalsound> With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . If you just make it real simple . Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . True . True . Hmm . And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . Mm eraser ? And we put uh <disfmarker> Looks a bit odd maybe . <vocalsound> That's a pretty big scroll wheel . That is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Something like that . <vocalsound> Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . And these are two buttons then . We could make two buttons out of that . And just um <disfmarker> If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . Yeah . So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel . Yeah . That's really a good good idea , I think . And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed . More obvious . So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . So if we <disfmarker> That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want . Yeah . Yeah . That's m that's better . So <disfmarker> So this is five buttons . If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall . So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button Y yeah . Mm yeah . Uh yeah , you get a a much smaller remote . and then you can <disfmarker> Uh yeah . That's right . And it sh So we can decrease this one to four buttons . Yeah ? Right now we have five . But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . Yeah . That's no problem . Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . Mm . And cases come right out of the machine . <gap> . And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one . I think this is a really easy one . Um , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ? Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . Yeah . But then again , <gap> all these changes are not really okay with me . <gap> . Richard's argument was very good . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yep . But since we just have to . <vocalsound> We have to cut costs . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I'd rather just go to the board I'm ag and get us to spend <vocalsound> eighteen dollars a a remote . Ask for more money . Yeah . Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah . Or do some market research and see what the options are . Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . Yep . Yeah . So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , Yeah . it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . So this is scroll . I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . <vocalsound> Before we went on to the to the whole design . Yes . Definitely . <vocalsound> The th But <disfmarker> I'm glad we could make a bit . Yeah . It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than <vocalsound> this one . <vocalsound> It's pretty different . <vocalsound> But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . No . This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . Yeah . It will . Yeah . <vocalsound> But um <disfmarker> 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them . No , but I think <disfmarker> So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . I think the most <disfmarker> But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . Yeah . That's right . So maybe it's uh <disfmarker> We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . Yeah . That's a good one . So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . But we will see . That's true . Might uh <disfmarker> might be confusing too . Yeah . That's definitely right . They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . But very special , so uh <disfmarker> I would buy it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . But you're not sixty . <vocalsound> That's right . I would buy it if I was six . <vocalsound> No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ? Uh , yes they are . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> No . But we can go on with the project evaluation . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule . Yeah . Um , the project process . So um , I like set up all these criteria . And evaluation of the thingy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot . I should <disfmarker> <vocalsound> There we are . Evaluation criteria . <vocalsound> Thank you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Go ahead . We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . Five more minutes ? No we've got fifteen minutes but <disfmarker> Okay . Uh yes . What ? 'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . Uh yeah . Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ? Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost . The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is <disfmarker> If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? And <disfmarker> So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . Okay . Let's see . Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . Mm . Okay . Yeah ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I tried to Interesting . but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . 'Kay . Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? I think it's fancy . Six . Yeah . Six . Uh six . Yeah . We all go for six ? Good . Um , is the design innovative ? Very . <vocalsound> Mm . Sh I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . Subtitles , buttons . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Seven . Seven ? Yeah . Yeah . So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Should be do-able . Yeah . That's right . Is the design easy to use ? Mm . Not really . That's a bit dodgy . Well <disfmarker> Would be for us . But <disfmarker> For old people I I <disfmarker> I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . Four or five . Yes . W Yeah . Four . I'd go for four , too . Yeah . Yeah . Is it functional ? Is the design functional ? <vocalsound> Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ? Yes . <vocalsound> N Yeah . I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? No . No . No . I don't think so . It's pretty slim . Think it's uh seven . Seven . Oh , and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and <disfmarker> R_S_I_ influences ? Mm m Mm , we haven't thought of that one . It was . Think we do . I had them worked out . Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . Are the production costs within the preset limits ? Yeah . Well <vocalsound> they are now . Yeah . <vocalsound> Does the design fit the group of focus ? I think that's a three . Mm , th yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh I think it's better . I think it doesn't . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> We have to test it I don't know . s But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I still <disfmarker> I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy . I think <disfmarker> I think it <disfmarker> I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . Uh , yeah , true . Yeah . I would give it a four . I'm not sure . I think I'd go for two . I go for three . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Then we have to do the three . It's the <disfmarker> 'Kay . Is the company company recognisable ? Yes it is . Yeah yeah . Well , we have the logo there . Yeah . So <disfmarker> And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . And we have the removable front cases . Yeah . So , I think it's very recognisable . Yeah . Yep . So that will be this . I was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this . We've got a calculate it . Mm ? Twendag sieven an twendag . Is this <disfmarker> Like after this , are we done ? Or <disfmarker> N We've gonna <disfmarker> We're going to evaluate it . We're gonna go to our other room again . Well , anyhow . These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? No . Nine ? <gap> Forty nine . Uh , minus one . Minus three , minus four . <vocalsound> Minus four . So that would be minus eight . Forty one out of forty nine . Forty one . That's <disfmarker> Around eighty percent . Okay . What is it ? Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . That's eighty four percent . I think that's a pretty nice score . Hmm . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Hmm . 'Kay . So <vocalsound> Okay . that will be the evaluation . Thank you . So , that brings us to the project evaluation . Yep . Thank you . <vocalsound> Project process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ? <vocalsound> Along the process ? Yes . Yeah . But it <disfmarker> Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase . Yeah . That's right . So lack of information about prices . Yeah . Definitely . Yeah . That's true . Yeah . Okay . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ? No . <vocalsound> No ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not too much . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh <disfmarker> Yeah , true . But <disfmarker> The room was <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . And I would've liked to go for the younger users also . <gap> . And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . Mm . Restrictions . Internet access . 'Kay . Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ? Yeah ? Yes . Yeah . Yeah . Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you <disfmarker> two of you with the uh last phase ? So <disfmarker> Yes , was okay . Yeah . Nice . The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <gap> tasks . Okay . Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? Or were they too much ? Well , Mm . the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but <disfmarker> The digital the digital pen is very nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Smart-board . Yeah . If it wants to download its uh data . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Failed download . Smart-board was irritating . <vocalsound> So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ? A flip-over or a more precise uh digit Yeah . A flipper's uh easier , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Faster as well , I think . Yes . Yeah . Flip-over . But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh you can sh save it Yeah . uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . Yeah , I tried to open the file on my laptop , So <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Yeah ? but <vocalsound> not possible . No . Didn't work . No ? Uh you need a smart board uh application I think . Yeah . T can uh can you export it uh like a <disfmarker> Yeah . But I think you can <disfmarker> Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image . <gap> no . Must <disfmarker> Yeah must be <disfmarker> Should've done that then . So the sharing of the information was uh was okay ? <gap> . Pen is here . Yes . Uh , network . Uh <gap> . Yeah , pen is here on the table . <vocalsound> Uh , yeah . So you can <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> It's possible . Mm . Yeah . It's possible . Okay . Okay . That's nice . Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? Or <disfmarker> Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh <disfmarker> Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev <gap> Yeah . Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh <disfmarker> Yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah . So So <disfmarker> everybody puts his own score . Mm-hmm . And then <vocalsound> it mediates the score , Yeah . Yeah . and you can get one <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . That's better . So that's uh <disfmarker> How do we call ? Evaluation criteria . Okay . Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ? Mm . Because I think then that we get to our last sheet . Are the costs within the budget ? Mm yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . They are . <vocalsound> Considering we are not going to make a docking station . Do we <disfmarker> Docking station . That's a good point . <gap> . But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? Yeah . Uh and I think you can compensate that as well . Perhaps . Mm . So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? Or what was it ? <vocalsound> Fifty grand . Fifteen fifteen million . I think we will . <vocalsound> If we gonna export this product . It's innovative . Yeah . Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . Sometimes . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah , still I think <disfmarker> Yeah . I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . You can do more . Yeah . Ah . So maybe we should just re-focus . Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . Ah . Or specifically for younger people . Ah . That's one thing you can change it with . That's true . So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage . Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers . Yeah . Hmm . Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now . But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Party party . That's it . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . Where's the champagne ? 'Kay . I don't know . I didn't get a message from the from ending of the <disfmarker> Uh , I believe y uh <disfmarker> Oh Oh I think I have one now . you did . Five more minutes ? Oh that's nice . Okay . Then we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . Or we can put these in the project folder as well . Mm-hmm . Maybe that's <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Export as picture , I think . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm . This is another network , I guess . <vocalsound> Does somebody see the project folder ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't . Hmm . My Documents . Uh maybe uh they will save it . So uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents Yeah , it probably will . and uh <disfmarker> That's okay . Okay . <vocalsound> I think I'm going to make our final presentation now . Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project . Okay . Okay . Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire . Yeah . Questionnaire . So uh <disfmarker> I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something . Okay . Okay . Hopefully my pen will download its software . Oh . Or data . <vocalsound> Yeah . That'd be nice .
So , I will open our functional design meeting . Mm-hmm . So , I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um Industrial Design . Marketing Expert . What's your talk ? Okay . Marketing Experts . <vocalsound> Mm . And after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . Mm so um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer . Okay . Um , so you're participant two ? One one . No no no . No you're <disfmarker> One . No , I'm participant one . <vocalsound> Three three , it's three sorry <vocalsound> . I I think I'm a <gap> . Okay , never mind . Okay . 'Kay , did you save your presentation ? <vocalsound> In one . In one , sorry <vocalsound> . Yeah . Isn't that technical functions ? No sure . So you didn't save it maybe . It's mine . Uh Alright , so <disfmarker> it's David Jordan . Course . <vocalsound> Name's Jordan . So David Jordan ? <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm yeah . Mm-hmm . so I'll <disfmarker> I let David Jordan do his presentation . Okay . No , no . Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think . Uh . Too great for email then . Okay , so . The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control . Yeah . Uh I I will focus on user interface design . Um so move to the next slide . Mm . As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very <disfmarker> has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . There's a lot of functions . Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . So how can we um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? Um , let's move to next slide . Um . Yeah . So I <disfmarker> so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface . A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . Um so move to next s slide . <vocalsound> So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller <vocalsound> which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . So <disfmarker> That's the end of the talk <vocalsound> the end of the presentation . <vocalsound> So you propose to to have the Uh <disfmarker> remote control which will be powerful . With sophisticated functions , but with very <disfmarker> So powerful , yeah powerful . many functions Yes . and very easy to use . Yep . So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , To merge the two system huh . I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> You mean this one ? Yeah . Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose . Mm yep . <gap> But But this is <disfmarker> But if we have very very good user interface Yeah . it take less time for user to learn how to use it . Yeah , and then <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah you <disfmarker> maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are <disfmarker> or almost the same , so the sign . Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ? Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . Oh it should <disfmarker> okay , yeah . So you have to <disfmarker> The sh the user there <disfmarker> The user should know . for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that <disfmarker> So . Yeah um such as maybe the <disfmarker> Yeah . So . Go on , go back and <disfmarker> Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . Yeah , Yeah , that's my job . <vocalsound> that's gonna be the trick . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's your job <vocalsound> That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to . It you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So , you will propose us something which is yeah so powerful and easy to use . Yep . Okay . Okay . Powerful and easy to use . So that's the point . Yeah , that's the point . So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things . Okay , okay . So you you're <disfmarker> Participant two . Yeah . Um . Okay . <gap> <vocalsound> The rationale must be <vocalsound> design , or <disfmarker> So , Baba is the uh the Industrial Designer . Okay . So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the Mm-hmm . how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based but <disfmarker> Mm . I propose a nifra infrared base <vocalsound> you know , so so for me I think that it is better <vocalsound> it's bet it's better to control T_V_ <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know <disfmarker> For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to <disfmarker> True . So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? I think it's cheaper than laser , so <vocalsound> . Yeah . Okay . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? Twelve , nearly thirteen , What the cost is ? yeah . The cost <disfmarker> Yeah , I think for the cost we want <disfmarker> for the cost we want <vocalsound> <disfmarker> it's better to have uh uh Twelve , twelve a half . Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here Mm-hmm . and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . That might just <disfmarker> So . You can go to the next slide . Okay . I have some kind of pictures you know , here . You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff Yeah . you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . What is this ? This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . Okay . Look . But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and <gap> . Okay . So and the next slide , it is the last one it's <disfmarker> So it's <disfmarker> I think it should be wire <vocalsound> wireless re remote con <vocalsound> Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . Okay . Okay , so Okay . if you have some question I didn't answer ? What's the average price of this technology then ? Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire <vocalsound> with remote control ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You'd <disfmarker> yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also . Okay . So you think that uh <vocalsound> a cable between the remote control <vocalsound> and the T_V_ <vocalsound> <disfmarker> won't be a good idea . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> No it wou maybe it will be cheaper <vocalsound> I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> Wireless remote control <vocalsound> . but <disfmarker> Yeah , but some pa I don't think <disfmarker> well , yeah , I don't think he would , I always want to have you know , <vocalsound> but in a sense <disfmarker> sometime I want to have wire because you know . Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ? Uh , <vocalsound> I don't <vocalsound> think it will be too much . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Could you answer please ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's <disfmarker> I think that you know you can always you know <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . Mm-hmm . As it's <disfmarker> The wire ? yeah . Yeah . True . Okay , yeah . I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . Mm-hmm . Uh that's my job . <vocalsound> Okay , That's the <disfmarker> <gap> I'm sorry . So <disfmarker> Now the <disfmarker> Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because <disfmarker> even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the <vocalsound> the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , <vocalsound> so <vocalsound> it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . Okay . <vocalsound> So just think of um the usability . Design a wireless remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? Yeah . Yeah . I think it's would be easier to have <vocalsound> a link between the remote control and the television , Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? yeah . True . This you will see in my presentation then . <vocalsound> So I will let you to do your presentation , so . Yeah . Okay <vocalsound> . Which is participant four . So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . We've made a study , so could you go to next slide . <vocalsound> Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , and see what was okay or not for them . Mm-hmm . Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's <disfmarker> You mean the loo the look , the outside ? The look , how it look like . Okay . Yeah , the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job , David , maybe . Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . Yeah . So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so <disfmarker> doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later . 'Kay . Could you go next slide ? Uh , so as you said uh , Mm-hmm . remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . <vocalsound> So this is from the experiments we've done , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . <vocalsound> What is R_S_I_ ? R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um <disfmarker> doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . <vocalsound> Yeah . Ah um okay . <vocalsound> Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide . Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . Okay . Mm-hmm . And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , Functions . this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay . Okay . So <disfmarker> Mm okay . And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? Yeah . Sure ? Yeah ? Yeah , I think possible . Because we can <disfmarker> We can uh mix uh several function in one button . Yeah . So lets you <disfmarker> then you have less buttons . Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? But I'm not sure <disfmarker> Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the Yeah , The manuals . I think the <disfmarker> manual . It's <disfmarker> No you you can have a switch menu , so you can Yeah , well but it has to be intuitive . for example <disfmarker> Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Yeah , okay . Okay , Then you you put the switch button , but <disfmarker> then it switch to another category of functions . Yeah . For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder . With a <disfmarker> So there's a different functions , but i if you you <disfmarker> there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . So we can has less buttons . Yeah , But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny <disfmarker> look fancy , not funny . but <disfmarker> Look fancy . <gap> This is a question that should be asked to the <disfmarker> If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people <gap> . Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , this is something we sh Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some <disfmarker> for other peoples , so . Mm-hmm . But this was first step and <disfmarker> This was the first step , yeah . I think the solution is to have many colours of <disfmarker> you know instead of having one grey standard <disfmarker> Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . Specially distribution , yeah . Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe . If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know <disfmarker> Yeah , it will cost little bit more . Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , Yeah , yeah , yeah . some people prefer black remote control . Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so . And also f Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , Yeah . so user can select which colour they prefer , so . Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , Mm-hmm . Yeah , remember it's twelve Euros . and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . Mm-hmm . Hmm . And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , Mm-hmm . they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . So <disfmarker> I think you have quite lot of points to to think about Yeah . and to discuss it with uh the other members . Yeah , hmm . Yeah . So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ? Yeah , it's done , just <disfmarker> yeah . If we would <disfmarker> if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . Mm-hmm . Okay . Mm so <disfmarker> So , So . I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , Mm-hmm . as it's something that's <disfmarker> It's is uh <disfmarker> Lame , No or <disfmarker> yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , Mm-hmm . so it's better to use internet then teletext . Yeah . So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , Yep . and also the remote control will only be used for television , so for y for you your designing , you're not <disfmarker> you won't be uh <disfmarker> you won't had <vocalsound> um buttons to just to manipulate <disfmarker> yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . Control . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm because if we want to to do remote control Mm . which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ? Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost . So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . Yeah . Okay . And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . Mm-hmm . Yeah . I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . Mm-hm . Mm-hmm . So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um Okay . of the uh of real reaction Okay . So . and uh also <disfmarker> So has to be yellow . Yeah . Yellow . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . Okay . Mm-hmm . Require lot of requirements , but <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> For cheap <vocalsound> remote control , yeah . And cheap . Yeah . A low cost . Yeah . But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches . <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> . Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so . <vocalsound> This is <disfmarker> I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . Maybe not , It's maybe more in browsing . but mayb Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it . Yeah . A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ . Okay . Ok Hm-mm . It's It's not so uh popular now . <vocalsound> It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know Mm . the global usage , Global , okay . so if people don't have the technology . So . Mm-hmm . So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? So I I so <disfmarker> As as for the colour , what what do you think ? I think it has to be yellow . <vocalsound> Yellow ? Yeah . Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? <vocalsound> Yellow ? <gap> T_V_ remote control ? <vocalsound> Min Maybe you can change the colour , Okay . but the image of the society has to be recognised . Okay . Yeah . I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be . Why you go <disfmarker> It has to be fashion . Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , Okay . So you have to <disfmarker> but just mm . Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . Okay , okay . Okay . And also it has to be attractive , of course , Mm . because if you want to sale <disfmarker> to sell the remote control . It's okay ? Regarding the first line , what <disfmarker> So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . Yeah . And that's it . Yeah . But <disfmarker> I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me . It's already changed for <disfmarker> I think it would be simpler . Mm-hmm . Okay . So <disfmarker> I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break . And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . Uh <disfmarker> Y you <disfmarker> You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um <disfmarker> pon Industrial Designer , yeah . Industrial Designer . Component component , yeah . yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept . Okay . And Florent to work my subject . Yep . And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . Okay . It's okay ? Yeah . I think the um session is closed . Good . And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . <vocalsound> Not in mine . Okay <vocalsound> Okay , that's clear . Okay <vocalsound> . Okay . <vocalsound> Should be better . <vocalsound>
Bonjour . It's <disfmarker> It won't wake up . Yeah . I was a bit early . Like <disfmarker> Why ? What ? No , I just came in . Uh normally I was one of them . Okay . Come on . Check check check check . Hello . Why won't it wake up ? Oop . Is it on ? The power light doesn't work . You turned it off . But how ? Ah , there it is . Okay . Okay . Uh . I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you . Okay , we're just going to the <gap> later . Okay . Yeah . Yeah , I received an email as well . So we're going to talk about the conceptual model . <vocalsound> Oh . <gap> Hmm . Which one was mine ? So that's me . <vocalsound> Uh okay . So <disfmarker> Uh okay . Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . <gap> What's it called , I dunno . <vocalsound> Whatever . The minutes . Okay , so we just talked about uh <disfmarker> Oh you want me to show that there or <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> No , Mm no . just tell us . Okay , we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um <disfmarker> It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . And it has to be easy to learn . That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ? Yeah . Yes . Okay . So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh presentation of your <disfmarker> Shall I start ? Yeah . <gap> <vocalsound> No . Okay well <disfmarker> I received an email <disfmarker> Okay . I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . <vocalsound> The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh <disfmarker> This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition . Hmm . But um <vocalsound> this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . But we already have the flashing flashing light on the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh maybe maybe something new . Yeah , more . We have to discuss about it Hmm . s uh <disfmarker> Okay , uh <gap> Well , Okay . I'll I'll get back on it . features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think . Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . Yeah . So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari <vocalsound> uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes . But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . Hmm . Spongy . But spongy , what what does spongy says ? Spongy . Spongy , like sponge . Spongy . Okay . <vocalsound> So rubber , kind of . Uh soft materials . Yeah . But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . Yeah , but <disfmarker> Yeah . So it has to be <vocalsound> flexible . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah . It's like a sponge . Soft , sponge . So it's also a stress-ball . That's a good <disfmarker> That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . Yeah , somewhat like <disfmarker> Yeah , but <disfmarker> Yeah . How are you gonna make it ? Is it a bit like like the the the the <gap> remote control ? R_ soft . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . Okay . Okay ? <vocalsound> What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts . Yeah . Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot . <vocalsound> And uh some basic uh colour fronts . <vocalsound> Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . <vocalsound> Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that . Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget . Yeah , I'll get back on that . So <disfmarker> Hmm . <vocalsound> It's very uh difficult to to to do it . Intro Yeah . Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . Yeah , Well , that's the problem . That's the main problem . I got f also an email from So <disfmarker> the the technology department . Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations . They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it . Okay . Well <disfmarker> Hmm . Okay . Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then . I'll check what they exact mean . So uh <disfmarker> Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement . Yeah , th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so <disfmarker> Um but uh <gap> if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can <gap> <disfmarker> Since you have to uh configure speech thing . But that's definitely more expensive than <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , that's that's something I dunno . Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be <gap> . Yeah , but a telephone <gap> <disfmarker> Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . Yeah , so uh we gotta de So uh <disfmarker> We have to decide on that . Yeah . Okay . That was this ? Mm uh <disfmarker> Oh I got an email uh <disfmarker> And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So it's m the most expensive . L_D_C_ doesn't require <disfmarker> Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip . Okay . And speech recognition ? Yeah , probably too . Advanced <gap> . Yeah . I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but <disfmarker> I'll I'll give you my design . Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display . Yeah okay . So we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well we can <disfmarker> I had uh to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . I think we should um <disfmarker> This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic . More modern . Y yes . Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out <disfmarker> both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this . And then changeable fonts , so <disfmarker> Hmm . It's the most important part , I think . But <disfmarker> And the home base is something like that , something simple . Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons . Yeah , maybe the teletext tel Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable , but it's <disfmarker> No , I don't uh <disfmarker> I don't like it . No . Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . Hmm . So <disfmarker> and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . <vocalsound> And I think <disfmarker> But it <disfmarker> That's on on the display . No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part . So the focus is on these two parts . Yeah . Yeah . So you don't see all the buttons you else need . <vocalsound> But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . Uh well um <disfmarker> So you can't use your thumb for it . This is how it is now . Um <disfmarker> Here uh <disfmarker> Well we have volume . I think it is on uh on the bottom too . Yeah , down there . But it's not not the best best . Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls . I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Yeah , Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel . I've I've got something of that uh too . Yeah , why not . For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more . Scroll . By just putting the volume on the side . And and just channel buttons here . And the channels as well . Oh yeah . Yeah , But I think uh <disfmarker> or uh maybe uh <disfmarker> The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . Well . Yeah , well it's <disfmarker> Basically it's it's here . Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . Yeah , that's better . They're on top ? Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom . Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . You mean uh these to the low ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . Except from the on-off button . Oh okay . Well , yeah . But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . So maybe we can put that on the bottom . Mm <disfmarker> Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll <disfmarker> Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be should be easy to <gap> . I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . Yeah okay . That's that's good , And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh <vocalsound> you don't see 'em very good . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there . Yeah okay . But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . Yeah . So we can uh switch these to <disfmarker> Hmm . I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . Okay . Yeah , But uh we we can switch those two , maybe <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Those two , yeah . yeah . And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh <disfmarker> Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , Okay . right . <gap> Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we <disfmarker> I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . Yeah . To use <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , that's cool . So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think . Okay . No . So that's something we have to decide on . Yeah , we have to keep it simple . Yeah . We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . What we're gonna do . Okay . Okay , the component design . I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not <disfmarker> Nothing square-like . Okay , so <disfmarker> Hmm , okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . <vocalsound> Yeah . And it is well curved <gap> square . Square . Like . Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think . Okay . So not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look . Yeah . And um sports and gaming device style characteristics . I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of Mm . looking , I think . Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the <vocalsound> remote control . Okay . Mm <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , So the colours also . it's <disfmarker> So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . Yeah . Black yellow control . <vocalsound> Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . Yeah , mm n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . Yeah , but uh <vocalsound> I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But <disfmarker> No , okay . We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , but <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think . <vocalsound> Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , it's cool . Yep . Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue And still trans Yes . and <disfmarker> Oh yeah . So <disfmarker> Still still transparent . Okay . Yeah . But with all with logo on it . Okay . Well this is a remote control , a very old one . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Then the components . The case has just a <disfmarker> Here's black . Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure . Yeah , I dunno . <gap> Yeah . Maybe . But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ? Well S one of the options . You can <disfmarker> Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . Okay . So you can just replace them I think . Yeah , we could do that . That was the idea , or just uh release one . Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . <vocalsound> Five different <disfmarker> Yeah , uh <disfmarker> Or just uh sell different ones . Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . So you can still th look through it . Yeah . Cool . Yeah . Yeah . Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft . Yeah , I uh I dunno . Yeah . A more <disfmarker> It it could be like a Nokia , like <gap> plastic . <vocalsound> Uh uh <disfmarker> Yeah , just uh <disfmarker> With the hard hard buttons . That's better prob I think uh rubber really has an odd look . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the <vocalsound> uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself . Yeah . It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't <disfmarker> Is <vocalsound> uh a button uh um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> How do you say it ? Yeah , It it didn't it i it's it's all on one level . it don't come out of the <vocalsound> on the background . Yeah , on one level . It is in uh the c a remote control uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , I know what you mean . So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod . Yeah . Uh just <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Okay , Yeah , that's cool . it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ? I think . Or maybe <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I dunno what uh kind of material it is . But <disfmarker> But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Yeah . Just only the basic uh Oops . basic remote control from normal plastic , <vocalsound> and Yeah . the rounds of it from softer s Okay . Yeah . And um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Then the L_E_D_ . <vocalsound> I dunno . The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s . Y So <disfmarker> Yeah . Cool . But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . So if you put <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh <disfmarker> Y i if you <disfmarker> The numbers could be can be <disfmarker> Yeah , that's right . Yeah . Okay . Or it runs the whole <disfmarker> Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So <disfmarker> They can choose . Yeah , you can halfs transparent , Or no or just that it's comes out a bit . Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights or <disfmarker> Different , I think , also . Yeah ? Blue . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Blue or red . <gap> Yeah . Whatever you want it , I think . Uh depends on the colour of the <disfmarker> Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . Uh i <gap> <vocalsound> You have to choose <disfmarker> Yeah , that's true . But <disfmarker> No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So <disfmarker> Is it <disfmarker> Yeah , Okay . but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? I I know <disfmarker> I dunno . Is <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , it can . You <disfmarker> 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . Yeah , okay . Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive . Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . I think it's <disfmarker> It's just <disfmarker> No , just some LED . I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . And I can change the colour of it . Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something . Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it <disfmarker> I th I don't think so . Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So <disfmarker> Hmm . Then uh some more technical things . <vocalsound> I don't know what it is , <vocalsound> but it should be there <vocalsound> I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , W <vocalsound> So we d we just need this and <vocalsound> this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things . so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls . I'm sure we can fit in . So I guess we j we just need that . <gap> Yeah . I don't know what they do or <disfmarker> Okay yeah , Yeah okay . We just <disfmarker> you can you can change <disfmarker> Yeah . No . Nah , but they just said we need it . Okay . Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . Yeah , a recharger maybe . Yeah , we have to make sure to uh <disfmarker> Yeah okay . Yeah We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? but <disfmarker> Is that still the <disfmarker> Yes . Yes . Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an <disfmarker> How do you call it ? Accu . A recha Oh no . Re recharger . Base station . Y Uh <disfmarker> Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah . uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best . Okay . Not a separate <disfmarker> No , just rechargeable batteries . Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one . Then uh I received some possibilities . <gap> Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh <disfmarker> Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda . Ah cool . Okay . So if you hold it , it gets powered . If you hold it . But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . Yeah , I don't think it will work , and <disfmarker> Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors , It's dark in the room . <gap> No . <vocalsound> It's just batteries , so <disfmarker> that's cheaper <gap> . Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . Yeah . Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth . Okay . So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . So we can't use the flat buttons . Mm . So we need uh two D_ . Yeah , I think . Yeah . Definitely . Um these kinda materials can be used . But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic . Yeah . Yeah , I think so too . The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume . Yeah , scroll wheels um <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . But I think just the volume is enough . Yeah . <gap> Uh <disfmarker> For channels it's not handy , Okay . because you scroll too fast . And uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . Mm <disfmarker> I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in . Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels . Yeah , okay . Okay . And um <disfmarker> Yeah , that was it I guess . Okay . Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or <disfmarker> Oh We haven't decided yet . just sk Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's <disfmarker> Uh I don't think a rubber case looks <disfmarker> Uh but we have to do something about the trend . L Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ? The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . Yeah , okay . That <disfmarker> Uh fruit and veg , or <disfmarker> And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers . Uh yeah i Just <disfmarker> Just on front . So you can <gap> the the spongy <disfmarker> yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control . No . Neith uh I don't like it uh neither . No . <gap> <vocalsound> I just can't imagine it . <vocalsound> So just hard plastic ? Yeah . Okay . Yeah , I think . Titanium . It's mentioned here uh . Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive . But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round . more rounded . But just in two D_ , not in depth . Yeah . Yeah , that's right . Okay . So <disfmarker> We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . <gap> So the energy uh is the recharger . We already know that . Yeah . Just a normal battery . We have batteries . Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one . Yeah . Regular . Okay , the case is just a plastic one . Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular . You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second . Okay . I think I'll just check it . And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . <gap> Yes . That's pretty much it . Yeah . User interface concept . And a flashy light . So uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But <gap> I dunno either . Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . Yeah . So we should did it here ? That's for the next one . So we're staying here ? That's for th Or should we do it in the next meeting ? Uh that <disfmarker> I think that's the next next meeting . Okay . But you definitely get a specific instruction . <vocalsound> Okay , so Yeah . now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? But th think about something that's more rounded . Just <disfmarker> And more <disfmarker> Yeah , uh It has to be <disfmarker> I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones . Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom . Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those . Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a <disfmarker> What the fuck is it ? <vocalsound> Okay . Mm <disfmarker> Doesn't work . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What ? You see what I mean ? If I draw here <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It draws about four centimetres lower Oh . Okay . than <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Nah okay . Just <gap> . Maybe you can make it like this . And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um <disfmarker> It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one . Like a very big scroll-wheel . <vocalsound> Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . Okay . Maybe , I dunno . Hmm . Okay , so we <vocalsound> have this at the moment . I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted . Yeah , you <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , so we'd have this . Is that okay ? Yeah . Yeah , I think it's probably better . that's a little problem , of course , as well . And <disfmarker> Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh <disfmarker> That's not scrollable too easy . Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ? I think in middle . Still on the bottom or <disfmarker> Uh wh what is the middle part ? That's the numbers . Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . Numbers , okay . Yeah , I agree as well . Use the dz It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . Because you already have the volume here , so <disfmarker> You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other . <gap> back and forth . Yeah , that's right . So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well . Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . But that's not <gap> want to zap very quick , so <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah , okay . I think uh zapping is the highest priority . Yeah ? Is this a opportunity , And then you use those uh <disfmarker> or you don't want a different <disfmarker> Yeah , of course uh . Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so <disfmarker> Why ? Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up <disfmarker> But still the next <disfmarker> It's still the next one . Yeah , Doesn't make <disfmarker> but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If you put them <disfmarker> Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . Yeah . It ma it doesn't make a big difference . I I think it's <disfmarker> But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . It's it's obvious , I think . Yeah , that's not not <disfmarker> It's not al uh always the same . But it's exactly th In uh <disfmarker> On most on most remote controls . Every remote control's uh different . Yeah , I think <disfmarker> So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . I dunno . No , I <disfmarker> You already have the volume on the side , uh I think <disfmarker> so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . Yeah . So it's uh <disfmarker> I think it's s so simple I dunno . you just <disfmarker> Okay . So but that's for that's for you , 'cause it's <disfmarker> Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . <vocalsound> Okay , so hmm . What did <disfmarker> What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno . Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ? Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . Yeah . 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . And the LED . No , you have uh <disfmarker> It is <disfmarker> Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . So <disfmarker> You have to look at that image of the iPod . Yes . Okay . More that uh kind of style . And a bit uh <disfmarker> Not not the old grey black <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Where you can put a ve Uh we have <disfmarker> If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right . Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ? Yeah , five . Let's give five . Or more <gap> or <disfmarker> Maybe you can buy separate ones And um uh <vocalsound> and uh <disfmarker> uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic . Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project . Yeah . Um I think <disfmarker> Yeah . No , That's your choice , I think huh . tha that will be <disfmarker> So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? Yes . Yeah , So you could put it like that , so top down . okay . Hmm ? Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station . Do we have to design that w as well ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh I'm not sure . The docking station ? Yeah , I think so . Hmm . Yeah , we can b But th Yeah , that can be very simple . Least . It c it could be just just a square , just a packet . Yeah , just a recharger . Yeah , just where you're around something . Li Yeah , we had one example . But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . Mm . Mm . Yeah , but that's a round one . Which w Maybe we can choose then . Here you see one that's very round . Oh yeah , okay . So I think that can be all kind of shapes . But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . Of the remote control ? That's all . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah <disfmarker> Yeah . Just round it up <gap> . Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod <gap> . But <disfmarker> No . More rounded . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's <disfmarker> This is also rounded . No , I think i just just the corners . <gap> Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm <gap> <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh <disfmarker> As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . Shapes . Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new . Not in depth . Yeah , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new . I've uh <disfmarker> I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a bit annoying , isn't it ? Yeah . What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square . Yeah okay , yeah well <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . I would do it <disfmarker> Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but <disfmarker> Yeah , it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Like in this kind of shape or <disfmarker> Uh it's very annoying . Okay . I dunno . I dunno if it's handy . <gap> I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . Uh <disfmarker> This ? Yeah . The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing . Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures <disfmarker> Oh I can show you here <vocalsound> what the old ones look like . Mm . Curves , curves . Yeah . You've more <gap> there as well . Yeah , okay . It wasn't very small one . Yeah . <gap> very simple . That is for elderly . So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . Yeah , I don't know . Yeah . I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . Yeah . So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . Mm-hmm . And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player . <vocalsound> Yeah . And you have the scroll button inside . Yes . Just a simple scrollb <gap> Okay . Yeah . But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of <disfmarker> Skip that one as well . Doesn't have to be . Okay . Yeah , it's cool . Yeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it . But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh the t the trend is Rubber spongy . spongy and fruity . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But yeah . Yeah . No . Spongy Spongeball kinda . and <disfmarker> It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh <disfmarker> Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . Mm . Okay . It <disfmarker> The th th Yeah , I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . No . Yeah . But I I think it's still for older people . You j still have older people . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal <disfmarker> There is one <disfmarker> Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public . There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different <disfmarker> Yeah , <gap> idea . But <vocalsound> you're <disfmarker> If you look at the way remote controls are now <disfmarker> Yeah , they're all the same . And if you make it look like the iPod <disfmarker> But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the <vocalsound> wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . compared to <disfmarker> Hmm . Ye yeah . Well uh <disfmarker> Yeah , we could do that . Could . Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow . Yeah . No , I think <disfmarker> Oh . It's right . Think the scroll wheel <vocalsound> won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . Yeah . So it will just be a small small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much . Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has <vocalsound> if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly . No . So maybe you have to ask her . Yeah okay . Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint . Okay . Yeah . I'll be able to do a better job . That's probably <disfmarker> If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . Doesn't work . <vocalsound> Okay , so just finish it . So we make it a bit like m that one probably . Yeah , I'll see it . Yeah . Is that okay ? Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod <gap> . Yeah . Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the <disfmarker> Yes . Just a <disfmarker> We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think <disfmarker> Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a S <vocalsound> Well uh Uh yeah , then it w <vocalsound> advanced chip . I don't know . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I think so . And we we have to build in a microphone and <disfmarker> Well that's very easy . We already have uh the beeping of the <gap> home station , Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that . so <disfmarker> I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , No . Uh strange that I received <vocalsound> the information about that . so <disfmarker> Oh that's hard . But <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said . We have to be original and uh technological innovative . Becau Yeah . Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , But <disfmarker> okay ? <vocalsound> Ma So shall we <gap> it open then ? Yeah . So we can put all the <disfmarker> The function of that in there . Yeah . Okay . And we need a <disfmarker> Fine . Probably we need a uh advanced chip then . Yeah , we probably do . But it doesn't say anything about it , Yeah . does it ? No . Oh yeah , But we don't have any f information about the cost . I <disfmarker> No . We started with information about the cost was now th I just I just received the <disfmarker> Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip . Yeah . And how much is the chip ? The the the <disfmarker> I don't know how much , but <disfmarker> Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . Just in inexpensive or <disfmarker> This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . And how how does it work ? Is it <disfmarker> Doesn't say . Just <disfmarker> You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . Because uh <disfmarker> So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning . It doesn't has to say anything . No . Just <disfmarker> You have to just talk to <disfmarker> Does it say does it say something back ? Yeah uh th that's just <disfmarker> It's a <disfmarker> Okay , we have to stop it now . So just <disfmarker> No . Yeah , it <disfmarker> Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced <disfmarker> But i it's a separate chip . I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , I don't know anything about this , Um <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> Nah . Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , because it's too difficult . I dunno . <vocalsound> Well it it would be would be a good feature feature . Yeah . Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature . <vocalsound> Okay . No no worries about the cost , etcetera . We have to stop now . Okay , And there's a chip in it that will <disfmarker> just <disfmarker> We have to stop it now . Okay . Fine .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Okay everyone's ready . Hello . So we are here for uh for uh functional design . <gap> Okay ? So we are here for the functional design meeting mm <vocalsound> so first I will show the agenda so we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so <vocalsound> I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board . Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . Of the <disfmarker> of the process . So uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? F do you want to start ? Make a start yeah . You can start . So . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Cable , camera . You have uh PowerPoint ? Should be in my <disfmarker> in their folder no ? Ah yeah maybe there . Up . Okay . Who are you ? <vocalsound> Um at three I think . <vocalsound> No ? <vocalsound> Mm . Ouch . <vocalsound> And <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> We have a technical problem uh . Do we think w s in the <disfmarker> in the wrong folder maybe ? <vocalsound> It is possible . You put it on <disfmarker> No . It was somewhere in something like this . I don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something . What do you have in short cut ? Go up . Participant two . Yeah go up . Yeah . Again . No . Go back . You have no <disfmarker> Uh maybe messenger AMI . Messenger . Over . Okay . No . There is nothing . There's no <disfmarker> We have a technical problem . Let's go and check . Yeah . I'll go and check . Otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? Okay . With the the whiteboard ? Yeah . If you remember yeah Yeah . but that's <disfmarker> So uh . Basically <vocalsound> what we want here is a remote control right . Yeah . <vocalsound> So um the question well first of all what to control . So <vocalsound> most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that . Mm-hmm . And <disfmarker> but other people want th also remotes for <vocalsound> controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff Mm-hmm . and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . Mm-hmm . So <vocalsound> there is one <disfmarker> that is one thing . The other is the the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have Okay . uh at the same time as <disfmarker> and general voice commands if you want yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So I think it should be a package in that case . Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . <vocalsound> One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . <vocalsound> Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . a set of buttons for <vocalsound> linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access . Okay . Yeah ? What do you mean by linear access then ? Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah . Ah . Um . Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's a fourth one no ? Mm ? So the better now for special navigation ? Yeah . For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ? Okay . Then linear access Uh . then random access . Mm . Yeah and also parameter changing . Ah yeah parameter okay . <vocalsound> So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um Okay . or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and <vocalsound> basically this is most of the <disfmarker> almost everybody has this stuff . Okay . Okay and and voice command did you uh <disfmarker> Voice command w we could specify anything . We could assign any button <disfmarker> a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , Okay . Okay . I guess so . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Yeah . So that's uh that close your investigations ? Yeah . Uh yeah I think so . Okay . Not so far . Okay . Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um I dunno if you can open the <disfmarker> I dunno if I can open it . uh m is not here . Maybe you can s It's <disfmarker> Uh in <disfmarker> yeah okay . Messenger no ? No . In document <gap> . Mm computer yeah . In which folder ? Where did you put it ? Here . Here . <vocalsound> Short-cut to AMI shared folder ? <gap> mm . But it's not <disfmarker> Um . Maybe you can send it to me by email . Just to participant one . At AMI . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I can do that . I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable . Okay . Um . You send it ? <vocalsound> It's participant one ? Yeah . Uh this is this email . I'm designing the user interface . <vocalsound> Okay . You can uh . Okay . So maybe I can switch slides when you <disfmarker> whenever you ask , Yeah . that will be more convenient . So okay , Okay so you can <disfmarker> you can go . functional requirements . Okay so <vocalsound> in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects Mm . and the subjects also filled a questionnaire Yeah . okay ? And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more <vocalsound> more nice , more kind . Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . <vocalsound> Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look <disfmarker> oh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> to <disfmarker> it's not good . <vocalsound> So okay . So it's not in theory <disfmarker> We can just keep doing that ? but I I can I can say yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . So mm <vocalsound> we have to have a remote control uh very um <vocalsound> out for that . <vocalsound> Uh the buttons have <disfmarker> are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . Okay . <vocalsound> Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh <vocalsound> ten per cents of but of the buttons in the <disfmarker> in the remote control . <vocalsound> Okay . So all the buttons we we have to put are <disfmarker> have to to have um a use a real use and not only or <disfmarker> Okay . Okay , so fewer buttons maybe would be good ? Yeah . F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons <vocalsound> . Okay . But what kind of remote controls did you look at ? Sorry ? What kind of task was it ? It was a T_V_ ? Yeah . Uh <vocalsound> most for most is T_V_ . Yeah . Yeah but in fact we <disfmarker> it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management Huh . Uh-huh . bo I will present them in the following . Ah ! Good . <vocalsound> 'Kay you can go so . Okay . So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to <vocalsound> to Yeah . To find it . to find it . Yeah . Um and um lot of the time they <disfmarker> it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . Yeah . So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use . Mm-hmm . Okay . And uh remote controls are bad for What is her other side ? R_S_I_ <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> I dunno . Other side yeah , yo wa your wrist <vocalsound> It i can become painful you can have tendonditis . Oh yeah ? Yeah . I did not knew that . If you also <gap> up on a computer in a strange position . Okay so you <disfmarker> we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah . Ergonomic . But uh <vocalsound> . Have to say ha ha . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It's your job <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh . Uh sorry <vocalsound> got a message from Microsoft . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay um before that I I have some some <vocalsound> some thing <vocalsound> uh to say before um <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the <disfmarker> Okay . and uh and not uh a lot for setting <disfmarker> for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and <disfmarker> Yeah . This function should be very uh accessible . Very accessible yes . Yeah , okay . That's right . This is the main function okay . <vocalsound> So then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control Yeah . Yeah . and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control Yeah . and you can go <vocalsound> we have here the results of The first question . of the questions . So you know that um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> for the younger it's very important To have L_C_D_ and voice . to have the s yes and speech recognition . And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . Okay . So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in . Yeah maybe this this is important . Yeah . Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can <disfmarker> Mm . we have to take care of that point of view I think or so . Mm . Yeah . Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing . Okay . Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before , e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock Yeah . and to to <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> An I s no , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay these are the user requi <vocalsound> I dunno if you see something else important or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm just thinking of some thing . Mm . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> We want to have a <disfmarker> no , I don't know if this is a good idea . We want to have a a general remote control for everything . No no no . We <disfmarker> w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . Okay . From the management board I receive an email . Mm . Yeah . Cos it would be costly uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control . Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah . Mm <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> it's not true I think . The the second claim that you put . No no . <vocalsound> That it would be too long to develop . Yeah . <vocalsound> I think that should be the same . Oh yeah . Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . So maybe it's a good decision . I dunno . What's your opinion ? I have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it . <vocalsound> I don't think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh yeah . Finish tonight . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation , it would be al you <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Yeah . but I think we have some technical problem or so . So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do If fact <disfmarker> I don't know . Yeah Mm . but <disfmarker> Do I have <disfmarker> oh yeah . <vocalsound> Now I have enough cables . Like a <disfmarker> you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so I'm just going to describe <disfmarker> in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . We just have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> sorry , <vocalsound> I'm going <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Are you okay ? <vocalsound> Like that . I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that um something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . Push button or a L_C_D_ . After that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared <disfmarker> um which is a an infrared um component . And so what we <disfmarker> for for myself this <disfmarker> for for us this is quite easy . U_C_ is the central unit ? Yeah . Okay yeah . Y it's a <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> this just a chip which does all the um numerical Computation . numerical computation according to your display . Okay . And so for us uh this is quite easy . We just need to take <disfmarker> to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the <disfmarker> not the <disfmarker> to the television . Okay . So for us this is quite easy . Okay so this is quite easy . Yeah . Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh There is not that much constraints . especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This will <disfmarker> think this will take more time to develop also . Yeah of course of course . Yeah . <vocalsound> And um but for a standard one this is really easy . It's a question of one month and so on s Soon . To have a <disfmarker> you s you speak about with voi voice control ? No no no no , I say <disfmarker> Standard button one . yeah <disfmarker> standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that . Yeah . So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Definitely . Yeah . So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ? <vocalsound> Ten years . I would say <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I would say uh about eight months to have the first results . <vocalsound> Okay so i it's a bit long yeah . Yeah . I can <disfmarker> Um . One month for the standard one with button . Yeah . Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ? Yeah even . I mean that this is really standard devices now . Um eight . For uh speech recognition . Okay yeah . Okay so we can take this into account . So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ? But we don't have time to market . <vocalsound> Yeah it will . And also <disfmarker> how much uh I think I think we should contact management . during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't <disfmarker> we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit <vocalsound> Euros . Yeah , yeah . so how many units should we sell to have a <disfmarker> Well . Uh <disfmarker> Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros . Yeah but how many <disfmarker> yeah . How muc how much do you get <disfmarker> how much do you <disfmarker> if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units . <vocalsound> Eh chips . We're gonna need chips right . Yeah . Yeah . How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ? <vocalsound> Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . Okay . Because we are <disfmarker> So you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition . Yeah , Yeah ? Okay . we can <disfmarker> So . No it doesn't . It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting . Mm-hmm . Okay . Four million . <gap> Okay . Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . Mm . Um I just had a question uh <vocalsound> do you want to continue with your presenta ? Yeah I I will continue . Is it <disfmarker> Well ask your question if you want . <vocalsound> Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent Mm ? of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control . Yeah . Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? Oh . To to <disfmarker> Would j maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . Uh <vocalsound> yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's it's okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . And <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> It's not intuitive first . Yeah . But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? You say that I want , I have six button <disfmarker> Mh-hmm . A a lot of people are uh <disfmarker> if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . But , but also it seems that <disfmarker> but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . so it's really something for the expert user . Okay . So <disfmarker> I mean there are markets and markets . I think the young people are th uh are uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Christine here said uh you have a <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> uh it is yeah . <vocalsound> So for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . I guess . I don't know if there is study about that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple <vocalsound> than creating a simple product . Mm . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Mm . And there are <disfmarker> Yeah . another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . Yeah . Yeah . All right ? Otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has <disfmarker> somebody has to learn to use it first . Yeah . Yeah . But also we we see that that most people find it <disfmarker> find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . Mm . Mm-hmm . So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons Yeah . and maybe also um some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . Losed lose it etcetera . Mm-hmm . These <disfmarker> these are <disfmarker> these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop . Mm . Mm-hmm . So but le let us see first the new requirement . So we don't have to <disfmarker> so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that <disfmarker> But teletext is just one button . Yeah but then you have to <disfmarker> you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff . You you just write the <disfmarker> write the numbers . Yeah . So well <disfmarker> So will you add with the channel keys , right ? Yeah . So . So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , <vocalsound> they prefer to s I am . I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button . Yeah . So . I dunno . If i one button is still one more button . If <disfmarker> if <disfmarker> if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . Mm-hmm . Well anyway I have this point . We can discuss . Also um <disfmarker> so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um because we want to be quick on on the market . And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the <disfmarker> on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . So this is the the key point . <vocalsound> So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the <disfmarker> o th of the control <disfmarker> of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera . Capital . Mm . <vocalsound> So do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used Mm . only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , Mm-hmm . no ? Mm . Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple . Yeah okay . So yeah the key point here is simple . Maybe . <vocalsound> So few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see in addition to that ? really . Yeah . Maybe switch T_V_ on and off <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can <disfmarker> revenue can come back to us . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Or something . Volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button . Mm . And that's all ? Uh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of <disfmarker> a lot of zapping . Mm-hmm . Mm . <vocalsound> I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , It's a memory , yeah . you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back . Okay . Yeah this is cool . Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button . So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> And uh and of course the channel changing buttons . Yeah . I I talk about that , yeah ? How should they how should we implement that ? Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental . Yeah . <vocalsound> Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them . Mm-hmm . Let's say that we can do something like that . This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five . We go faster ? To go fa to go faster . Mm . Mm . It's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . So if you you have your ten buttons for the <disfmarker> for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have <disfmarker> instead of having just one memory <vocalsound> Yeah . you have if you press them for a long time <disfmarker> No . Doesn't work <vocalsound> does it . Maybe we should have also a digit button <disfmarker> Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Change channel to eight . <vocalsound> Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental . No . <vocalsound> I dunno bec because if you have the <disfmarker> Well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot <disfmarker> you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental . Uh . Yeah . Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So I think we need also digits . Okay . Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits . Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time <vocalsound> Yeah . and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or we can do something like that . We can design the remote control to have access . Yeah . <vocalsound> You know some remote control have uh protection Mm-hmm . and so you you y Yeah . Hey I just thought this thing <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> there is a <disfmarker> I mean you know there is are some <gap> with a wheel like this . Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel . Yeah . Yeah , a kind of joystick . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental . Yeah . Okay . So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> and uh yeah I think this is the basi On the lower side I think it <disfmarker> you have to turn it . No ? And do we <disfmarker> do we have a <disfmarker> If we do that . Or a <disfmarker> or a ball , yeah , not a a wheel but a ball , and you say uh to <disfmarker> No , a wheel is better . Yeah . I would say the wheel is better . Because of that <vocalsound> What is the expert of uh <disfmarker> Yeah . The channels change one by one . Yeah . So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit . Yeah , the <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's a good idea . Well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control . 'S quite <disfmarker> it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the <disfmarker> on the wheel . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Even if i L_E_D_ uh or a if if it's the L_C_D_ feature uh A blue <disfmarker> a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um . whatever , yeah . Yeah , <vocalsound> and do we put an L_C_D_ display ? Yeah . Because it was important for young customers if you remember . <vocalsound> I think it's only put on if cou have multi function . Yeah . If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ . Just increase the cost . Okay . <vocalsound> The user does not have an advantage really . So no L_C_D_ ? Mm-hmm . Hmm . And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process Okay . Well if it's going to delay yeah but uh <vocalsound> it will be cool . It would . Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . Mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . That would be cool . But eight months is really long Yeah . and <disfmarker> Maybe we can just uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ten years <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . So um I I will uh <disfmarker> I will <disfmarker> so I we will move to next meeting so in <disfmarker> after the lunch break Mm-hmm . uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you <disfmarker> if you want but well the instruction will be sent . So thank you for uh your suggestion Okay . and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided . Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether . Yeah . That would be easier . Mm . What is the folder that you put yours in ? And did it it did work ? <vocalsound> No . No it did not work . No no . She send it to me by email . Ah yeah . Mm . I dunno , I dunno it . Okay . So maybe this is better , to send it by email . Okay what is your email ? Okay ? So yeah I I'm <disfmarker> it's in the first uh email so I'm participant one at AMI At participant one . Okay . uh where is that , it's here . Participant one at AMI . <vocalsound> Okay . So see you after lunch break . 'Kay thank you . Well during lunch break actually . <vocalsound> So next time we should have a fight . <vocalsound> How about uh <gap> management or something . Who happens to be your friend . <vocalsound> <gap>
Did you get my email with the slides ? Ah . Tricky . I guess I have to change the pen otherwise . Will be completely different . Dunno . Maybe they're supposed <disfmarker> the pen's supposed to go over the seats . Might be seat floor rather than person . Yeah , put it back . Yeah . And do you think <vocalsound> it's <gap> . Yep <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . Jo's making faces at me . <vocalsound> Yeah . So . Matthew is uh late again . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Probably an important man . Um . So well it is important for him to be here uh . <vocalsound> Yeah . So what can you <disfmarker> <gap> ? He he he <disfmarker> You did work together didn't you ? Yeah we will <disfmarker> yeah , so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer . I think we can put on the <gap> here . Yes . Yes . Yes . Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items . Mm . Um yes Um , can we have a phone , but w we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> can someone <disfmarker> Yes , maybe we should phone him . it's really w well designed <vocalsound> . Um well <disfmarker> Um , Mm . Mm , object tracking . <vocalsound> when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . Um so Yeah . just for record I I will take uh notes again . Okay . And um well <vocalsound> first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . 'Kay . when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . There is no <vocalsound> uh no negotiation uh <vocalsound> possible in this matter . So we have to consider that . <vocalsound> Good . Yep . Um so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation . Well we can't <disfmarker> no <disfmarker> we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . Okay Matthew . Nice uh you are here . Great . Great . Great . Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . Yep . So I will start by the the basic one that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , Mm-hmm . and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board . And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , Mm 'kay . and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf <vocalsound> when they see this stuff . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or browse . And also it's not too far from um a mobile . Mm . Mm-hmm . So people are used to that kind of shape , Mm . Mm-hmm . right . Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . we don't take <disfmarker> yeah . So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I <disfmarker> yeah . Eye . Mm-hmm . yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ , L_E_D_ . the on-off button , in red . Mm-hmm . Here would be the volume . On the on the left , Oh yeah . Uh-huh . Mm-hmm , hmm . okay , so <gap> easy to turn on t and off . Yes . And um so this is a very cheap version so there are <disfmarker> maybe you can carry on uh Matthew . Also <vocalsound> so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , Mm-hmm . Yeah . uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ? Oh <gap> no no no , this is a single <disfmarker> this this is a model with just the T_V_ one . Okay yeah . Yeah yeah . No no Ah , okay . just sorry , this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . Mm-hmm . The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then , it's only <disfmarker> It's a very basic minimal thing Mm . which you can <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it <gap> <disfmarker> that it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . <vocalsound> Mm . Mm . Seven , eight , ei eight Euros . Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So this one model and uh <disfmarker> Can I see ? yeah . Sure . Thanks . Okay I like the volume control , that's good . <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Th <vocalsound> this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that , you know like <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . Yeah . <vocalsound> So it doesn't actually have buttons . <vocalsound> So that uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> then what we look t Did you wanna see ? yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah no you can carry on , This is a model , yeah . I just look how it feels all . Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . Mm . Yeah . Yep . Just I'm <disfmarker> Yeah actually , yeah . I really want to talk to it . But <gap> . <vocalsound> It won't talk back . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So but but continue with your uh Uh so well mm-hmm . then the this is the <vocalsound> a more a little uh smooth <gap> and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . Right . Mm . And so they have more space actually Mm-hmm . and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh <gap> uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , Mm-hmm . and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo Play , pause . yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here Mm-hmm . and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it <disfmarker> From D_V_D_ player to television or something . Yeah . I really can change it , Exactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand . Yes . so <disfmarker> Mm . Instead of having many switches , y <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah . The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , Yes . Mm-hmm . and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , This is the orange button , the <vocalsound> microphone . or in the button th here , so which can Mm-hmm . uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . An yeah . And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , Mm-hmm . which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier Yeah . okay . And uh well Mm-hmm <vocalsound> . then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , Yeah . <vocalsound> when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover <vocalsound> Crazy dis designer , Mm . Yeah you know . okay . <vocalsound> Design enter <vocalsound> . but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . It's basically to do that . Yeah . But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh well an eye-attracting feature <vocalsound> which shouldn't be shouldn't be <disfmarker> Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , <vocalsound> when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , Oh actually <disfmarker> well . <vocalsound> That th that's true . you know , uh you want to uh <disfmarker> and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection Mm . because when it falls down or something it it is it is is is it gives a protec Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes , more robust . it's more robust that way . Uh yeah . Yes okay . Mm . And you have very good chances <disfmarker> It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh <vocalsound> it's it's sixteen Francs . It <disfmarker> Sixteen Euros . Sixteen Euros <gap> Okay . sorry . <vocalsound> So it's well outside the budget then . Then it's out of budget . But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . But w And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item <disfmarker> Yeah . Three Euros . so three Euros sorry . And um <disfmarker> That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? No no no , part of that , yeah . Part of that <gap> . So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Mm 'kay . Hmm . <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well uh if you <disfmarker> we can have <disfmarker> if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Well I think th th yeah we should <vocalsound> stick with uh a number of keys Mm . because if we add too much then Yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything . Mm-hmm <gap> . it's too <disfmarker> What's this one on the side ? Ah that's for the <disfmarker> it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery Locati . Location . Ah okay . and as well as it's like a blinking one you know Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . you can keep it aside . Yeah . I like the shape of them , I do like the the size and the the shape . Yeah . Well well <disfmarker> Mm . Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay . And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . Yes . Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . Okay . <vocalsound> Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . Mm-hmm . We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account <disfmarker> Well just do it quickly Yep . if if we al already <gap> . So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . Mm-hmm . Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> These are the things we identified as being important . Um <gap> the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components Mm-hmm . um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ? Um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , <gap> <disfmarker> Okay . So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . Not sure how this is gonna come out . So the first one was really <vocalsound> very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? 'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a <disfmarker> Mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it . Mm-hmm . And then <disfmarker> I mean w w w you must just see it <vocalsound> <disfmarker> we can still spend this four and a half Euro Mm-hmm . and to r Yep . because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . so we just have to offer as much as as <disfmarker> well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro . Functionality . Okay so look and feel , innovation <disfmarker> <gap> And now it <gap> easy to use . Easy to use . <vocalsound> Mm . <gap> target . Mm-hmm . And trends . Oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? Is that part of both of them or ? Um well w w we can still discuss that . Okay . So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options Mm-hmm . because they are too expensive , Mm-hmm . but um I've received uh a framework which we can do this . I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ? Mm-hmm . No . No . No okay , No . this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , <vocalsound> so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh . Mm-hmm . Okay . So maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one . <vocalsound> Okay . Yep . So it's the pink . Th th this is the first design . And the other one's green . Yes . Okay , so look and feel ? Where um one is <vocalsound> I've broken the pen again . Uh there is another pen . S yeah . Get that one . Um w <vocalsound> one's bad and seven's the best . Sorry , one's true and seven's false . One's the best . Okay . So on a scale of one to seven ? 'Kay . Okay . So . Look and feel . Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <gap> In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , yeah . so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But that's just half , we should also consider look , Mm-hmm . and then i it looks quite conventional . Mm . Don't you agree ? Mm yeah . On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , So maybe two . Hmm . Hmm . Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five so <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> It's my opinion , but I don't know what what Well I will give it maybe <disfmarker> we have anyways <disfmarker> the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . you know . It <disfmarker> though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case Yeah . Four maybe . you know . Four ? Four yeah Four , four . Okay . Now we th th that <disfmarker> then we settle on four . Mm-hmm . Yeah . I will gi yeah . <gap> Uh . 'Kay . Can you maybe fix the other <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . If you press like this not like this <gap> then you <disfmarker> <gap> No that's the <disfmarker> No . C can you get the batteries ? ink's dried . No no the battery has fallen down , Battery's low , that's i isn't it the ink ? The b that's the that that one ? Yeah . <gap> battery there . But <disfmarker> No no it's not that , it's how to close a battery . Okay . Okay ? Now it should be <gap> . Mm . No I think it's lost a battery . Mm , try it , just try it . No it's <disfmarker> Oh it will not It would still write ri but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . mm , mm . Is there another battery there ? Oh yeah . You got a second ? Try a <disfmarker> Well we won't be able to tell . Yes , it it has a <disfmarker> mm . <vocalsound> Perfect . Is that working ? <vocalsound> Did it come out ? Good . Okay . Good . Good . Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just a normal whiteboard marker Yeah , yeah . but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . Yep . Okay . So then then <disfmarker> And the other one ? Wow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah . I think it's slightly better , um , Mm . it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> When we want to include <disfmarker> I I I'm doubting about this this component . It it it it breaks Mm . in your <disfmarker> 'Kay maybe <disfmarker> No Mm . actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , Okay . it it's n i it is jus It's not a button it's a led , it's a <disfmarker> It's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve <disfmarker> Ac actually yeah it should be embedded . Mm , yes I see , mm okay . It's <disfmarker> will be embedded there Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Oh so it won't be really you know protruding or something . you can push push it again , you can push it . Yeah . The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? Yeah . 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . maybe it won't work so well . No you <disfmarker> it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that <disfmarker> Okay . Well r r I'd say two or three for that one , personally . Mm . Probably more towards three than two . <vocalsound> I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse . So so <vocalsound> I would also say this is four . Okay . But w w do you <disfmarker> what do you think ? Uh it's fine I think . My <disfmarker> just that um the feel is that um you <disfmarker> right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Yes . This is how embedded one will <disfmarker> Yes , it basically is the same shape . Yeah . It's a bas basically the same thing actually . Mm-hmm . Mm . You will be <disfmarker> Except that in this c And the L_C_D_ makes it better . Yeah . Yeah <vocalsound> And <vocalsound> you might have a slight thing for to forward and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm , okay . So I will say two . Yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . Yeah , yeah . Yes , okay <gap> . I would say two , three . Okay . Yeah . So , consensus ? Two or three ? Two ? Mm . Two's good Two ? Yep . yes . <gap> looking like <disfmarker> Um , 'kay . Innovation . The first one , not really muc Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , Mm . Yeah . right ? No but except for the design of the surf <vocalsound> . Do we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . The surf uh design <vocalsound> . Mm . Mm . What <disfmarker> What features are we actually including ? You should be rea <vocalsound> Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? <vocalsound> Uh no I think it's more of the feel . There's nothing like that ? But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . The only innova innovation is the shape . Yeah <gap> . Say about that . Okay . S so that <disfmarker> So there's no <disfmarker> this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . Yeah . You're right <gap> . Yeah . So I'd be up for seven for innovation . Yeah . And the <disfmarker> And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . Yep . Mm . And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part . Yeah , it gives it <disfmarker> Yes . A and the L_C_D_ screen is <disfmarker> Yeah . That's that's that's well it's quite innovative . And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . Mm . Uh could put it at one or two I would say . Personally . Okay . Yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm . Yep . So what is it , what are the innovations with this ? Got the L_C_D_ screen . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah automatic speech recognition . Is that in this one though ? Is this <disfmarker> 'cause this is the <disfmarker> No , Th th there were different options we discussed then , we ha we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget . Okay . Yeah . So the cost for these were <disfmarker> So <vocalsound> <disfmarker> what was the cost for the first one ? Eight Euros ? Eight . Eight . Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah . Yeah , eight Euros yeah . And this one was sixteen Euros . Yes . Sixteen . Sixteen Euros . Okay . So . Innovation for this one is two ? One ? It's a two , I would say two <gap> . Two ? W W un to be one what would do we nee actually , Two . yeah , I don't see <disfmarker> Why it is one . okay , one would would be without buttons , <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A man <disfmarker> w w Mm . Well Yeah . Yes . the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , Bu Yeah . so <gap> So maybe we can put one . This this is it w with the speech recognition ? It's using speech recognition , yeah . Okay yeah . Well . Gi given that <vocalsound> that it works , Give it a one ? Yeah , one , yeah . Yep . <vocalsound> then it's I think one . Okay . <gap> Ease of use ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> So the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , Mm . He is used to it act Yeah . Mm . right ? They are used to it actually . Yep . So that's maybe a a two for ease of use . Yeah . Here there may <disfmarker> Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . Uh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi Okay . Hmm . So maybe a three or a four . Uh yeah , actually in fact I think it will be <disfmarker> One me um we hope <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> <disfmarker> maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . Mm . Yeah but <vocalsound> y And there is a <disfmarker> like I would say three . Or maybe four <gap> . Okay . Well Consensus ? Three or four ? we have reduced the keys actually you see . Three , I would . Three . Three is fine with me . Yeah , yeah Three ? Okay . because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah it's a <disfmarker> actually the user has to put some effort to do <disfmarker> use that actually , No . Mm-hmm . it's not so easy , like this one the normal . Yeah . Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . Is quite easy yeah . So so I think th three is good . Yeah . Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . Okay . Good . What's the next ? So three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic . Mm . So So <disfmarker> we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? Twe twenty to forty , yes that's <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> This one would be uh for grandmothers <vocalsound> . Mm . <vocalsound> Oh no , this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually . No . Yeah , grandmothers , yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So sh completely changed our demographic there , And <disfmarker> it's not part of the the funky young thing . Well exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , Yeah that's true . Yeah . Yeah . but <disfmarker> If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being <disfmarker> applying to the the demographic Yeah . yeah . That's <disfmarker> it's still <disfmarker> Ye Mm w w w we <disfmarker> after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic Mm . 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , Mm . that's right . But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh yeah , <gap> . Do you agree ? And <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> Well I think <disfmarker> Yeah because it's so important <disfmarker> it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its <disfmarker> it targets , the right range of people , right ? Yeah . Uh yeah Mm . but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . Yeah . But w But it's going to be cheap whatever though , So <disfmarker> it was set with i we've got a set price . And people can still decide to use the cheaper one Yeah . instead of a <disfmarker> But for us it's <vocalsound> yeah <vocalsound> we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . Mm , yeah , indeed . Yeah . There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . <gap> Yeah . Ju just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it's not going to be cheaper . Okay . Okay . So in that case well it's fine then . Yeah . We can <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Okay . Okay . Um yeah . and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? And the demographics of <disfmarker> It's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> I think it's better , because of the L_C_D_ screen Mm . which is really an appeal on the on the on the Yeah . on the <gap> and on the <disfmarker> Yeah . And if you want to target <disfmarker> yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . Mm-hmm . Mm . So , the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , Yeah . yes . Because it <disfmarker> I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . Yeah . Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes <vocalsound> , Mm . Okay . so . Wh what <disfmarker> what <disfmarker> I'd probably go with three again for that one . Yeah I think it's uh <disfmarker> it has more market actually . Or even <disfmarker> Even one and two . Or two . Mm-hmm . Y yeah , you know <disfmarker> No s say t two . Okay . two . So , two , yeah ? Two ? Yeah . Two yeah . Yeah two yeah . Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add <vocalsound> lot of sophistication on that . Mm-hmm . Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include Yeah . Yep . for the people to <disfmarker> And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , and that makes it more appealing , it's more of a a new fun toy . We have to practically test it . The field test will tell you how good . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay . Okay , the final point , trends . And following the trends . The trends . So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . Mm . Mm . <vocalsound> So as it is , not really doing either of them . I think <disfmarker> Spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Well , the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , I know some <disfmarker> have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and <disfmarker> not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons Uh okay . it's got just a one bit on it Mm . Yeah I know . and so you can <disfmarker> that feels kinda spongy . But this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons . Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . So it's sort of , yeah . Mm . Okay . So <disfmarker> Uh Mm . the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . But that's if you're using the covers . And the then we can al Yeah . Or is it just one <disfmarker> yes . We can <disfmarker> we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover for s such a phone ? I mean <disfmarker> Well they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated . But why do you want to cover that actually ? In that uh w in the mod Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh <disfmarker> So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . Yeah . This is possible . I th I th I think <gap> <disfmarker> Uh uh y are you sure ? Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . O o or just two things which can be put on each other . Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah exactly like Nokia phones <vocalsound> . Mm . <vocalsound> Yes , exactly like it . Yep . Uh , so Maybe we can <vocalsound> but we have to decide it , we can put the the <vocalsound> the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers Mm-hmm . and s now try to invest in the in in the features . I think the <disfmarker> if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion Mm . even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it Mm mm mm mm mm . and then it'll still be in fashion . Yeah . 'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , Mm . and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . Mm . Mm . So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . Mm . Yep . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yep . Mm . Mm . Mm . And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . Yes . So so so that that would make the trends equal , Yeah . so we we we really have <disfmarker> don't have , Mm . There's n yeah . 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . I mean <disfmarker> Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one . Yeah , Yes , indeed . so a a point better for the for the number two <vocalsound> . Okay . So . Two and three , or one and two ? Yes . <gap> Yeah , it's one . Say , say one and two . One and two . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . So le le let's see . So d this one has spongy but buttons ? Okay . Yeah , it says a <disfmarker> Yeah , the blue one uh spongy . Mm , I see , yes okay . Good . Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five <disfmarker> mm nine by five , one point s eight ? Just add it . Nine . You know . One point six , Three , six , seven . one point <disfmarker> <gap> One point eight yeah . This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two Four point <disfmarker> Uh four point two . yep . Very good . Okay . But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway . Mm-hmm . We <disfmarker> we must try to get them closer . Yeah , it's right , yeah that's right . <vocalsound> Yep . Both in i i Wow . or we just have to choose . And adapt . Because , when we choose for this one we have to <vocalsound> we have to make it more attractive Yep . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . and w when we <gap> to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . <vocalsound> Yes , well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That'll basically take us down to the budget . But I'm <vocalsound> now <disfmarker> did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ? So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . Mm . Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , Yeah . Yep . Mm , so maybe we have to recap with this one . tha Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . Well yes , well uh re reconsider it . So <vocalsound> let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , Mm-hmm . uh what kind of energy source uh I I <disfmarker> we didn't speak about that . It's a <disfmarker> it's a normal battery , or <disfmarker> Yeah , it migh It <disfmarker> it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just <disfmarker> maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . What do you say , Mael ? For this one it's a normal battery <gap> . Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . Electronics . <gap> given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . Yeah . Uh sample speaker , yeah . Yeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes . Sample , yeah , this one . Yes , this one . Okay . Case ? Um , So <disfmarker> Curved . Double curved yeah right . <vocalsound> I see <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I It's uh <disfmarker> Double curve . Mm . <gap> Yeah , it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely . So Mm . which one are we talking to ? Are you talking about this or that ? Well <disfmarker> Either of them . Oh yes , we are talking about , Mm-hmm . but they have the same shape , but , actually bu Mm . They're both going to be not basic cases . Yeah . So th th this would be double curves ? Mm-hmm . Yeah . 'Kay . Uh , plastic would be the material . Yeah . The basic one , yep . Is it zero Franc ? <vocalsound> A special colour ? <vocalsound> Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . Uh <disfmarker> So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display . Push . Mm , yes , but <disfmarker> L_C_D_ is <gap> . It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ <gap> . Is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? Yeah Ah good . th now this is per per unit , this number of components . So it would need twelve buttons . Yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? No but for this one it's twelve Euro . No , for that one also . There are twelve ? So , Yeah that's a scroll . one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , t Yes . Twelve I believe . So this comes to eighteen . Mm . And that's without any special button supplements . Yeah , one scroll wheel you might need . So <disfmarker> So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . They're not just standard buttons . Uh <disfmarker> So I think <disfmarker> but th do you agree th that thi Wait a minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , right ? Because it's <disfmarker> there is no like <vocalsound> . Yes I But I thought it would be curved on two <disfmarker> it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought . Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . Well it's <gap> Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes . you know this curve like this so , it's w there is only is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are <disfmarker> You talking about concave curves ? Uh-huh . yeah concave . So I think we can put um <disfmarker> Both . You think a single curved ? <vocalsound> the single curved in the sixteen . That makes uh seventeen . And what are just <disfmarker> The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> We have more , we've got those <disfmarker> the scroll wheel on the side So I had a bad uh bad estimation . and yeah <disfmarker> Bad estimate , W <vocalsound> d <vocalsound> right ? The sc we have <disfmarker> we haven't talk about a <gap> , but that's no a <gap> is very exp inexpensive I believe Mm . but it is not in the list . We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there . W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? <vocalsound> No no no . 'Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . Yes , a kind of scroll wheel . So this is even more than the um than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros . Mm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay , so based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker <disfmarker> That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . So <disfmarker> um <disfmarker> But still , yeah it <gap> We just need that actually . We need one . We're <disfmarker> We <disfmarker> We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? Yes ? No we cannot , yeah . So so So <disfmarker> S w when we w a But the um <disfmarker> this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . Yeah but if you have the <disfmarker> near the L_C_D_ you can um <vocalsound> choose <disfmarker> select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . Transti Right , Matthew ? Oh I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> i it <disfmarker> Or regular chip ? I think it's going to be <disfmarker> y y I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah . Say <gap> say it's regular , regular chip , Yeah . Okay . Okay . and we still on fifteen , Yeah . so <disfmarker> So . And what about the number of buttons buttons uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> my Matthew ? Yes but that <disfmarker> maybe <disfmarker> Well we can just say Uh <disfmarker> <gap> one . When you look at this w , this u uh item , <disfmarker> Yeah . Ca l we are just <disfmarker> But <vocalsound> <disfmarker> when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . So is it possible ? <vocalsound> But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . That'll be <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really <vocalsound> really low , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No no , he he he I I Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> no ? So <gap> the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself . Mm-hmm . And uh we don't want to to change that right ? We we really want a L_C_D_ Uh <disfmarker> other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . Mm-hmm . Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . It's evident . Yeah . Mm . So And I dunno <disfmarker> twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . And the chip . Mm . Sorry the chip's up there already . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that . <vocalsound> A So wha what what each of us think about the <disfmarker> because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um <disfmarker> Do you think it's important ? Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? I dunno , I'm just asking . A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , Mm <disfmarker> Mm . Yep . for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or <disfmarker> and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is <disfmarker> that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least . Mm . Yeah . I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . Okay so we can get rid of it Yeah , it's true yeah . and then add a couple of buttons . But uh , do we want that ? On the market point of view , yeah . What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ? Mm . I For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . I <gap> think we have to come to a decision now , <vocalsound> Mm . just I I think we we what we just do i is vote about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display Mm-hmm . so <disfmarker> You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , right ? Yes . Okay . Yes . Yes . <vocalsound> Okay . One man one vote . <vocalsound> S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in . Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We need to be . <vocalsound> Bu y you're a power voter <disfmarker> uh veto anyway as Project Manager . Mm-hmm , I know , Yeah . <gap> . but <disfmarker> Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . <gap> well we have to make a decision now , that's it . Yeah . Yes . So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . Is that acceptable ? Ca can I have <disfmarker> can the functions be implement in an <disfmarker> Yes . You've <disfmarker> you you agree . W I I I just <disfmarker> So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . Yeah . So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons <vocalsound> . Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . Mm . Mm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use . Okay , <gap> . That will create another problem . For the people to use it . It's not going to be easy . Doing that . Okay . Okay . Mm . So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion . No , it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen Just <disfmarker> and introduce two more buttons . Okay . So L_C_D_'s out , is speech rec out now ? We've <disfmarker> The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , yeah . Yep . Uh where , L_C_ <disfmarker> Yep . Okay w we now we can just uh <disfmarker> So are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings . Yeah . Yes . So <gap> just look at <disfmarker> forget that one and look at that one now . Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one Yeah . and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price , Mm . Yep . okay . Okay . Well My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . that's that's <disfmarker> Yep . Actually yeah , we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah . So . Mm . Yeah . Yep . So Okay . w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . Okay , good . Then we <gap> the same . Thank you . Okay . That was it . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . That's it . <vocalsound> Thanks . Cool . Okay .
Um we are <disfmarker> So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . So <gap> switching over I've just left uh my first two screens <gap> . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . Okay . Cool . <vocalsound> Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? Mm um . No , I don't think so . N No ? Okay , cool . No . Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . Yeah . <vocalsound> Hi , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . So we have to look on this . First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . So what are our findings ? In our <vocalsound> uh in our findings we have seen that <disfmarker> when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take <disfmarker> in designing our rem uh remote controls . The last one is the most important one , is it ? No the first one is the Oh , sorry . <gap> uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , Okay . the fancy design Okay . uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . <vocalsound> So that indicates our technological advancement . Mm-hmm . And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , Mm-hmm . like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . And it should be uh <disfmarker> and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls . When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh <disfmarker> our recent fashion update shows that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sorry . <vocalsound> Ah yeah ? <vocalsound> I was just reading fruit and vegetables . <vocalsound> Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . <vocalsound> Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , <gap> and everything with fruits and vegetables , <gap> <vocalsound> because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , Okay . becoming more and more organic , Yeah . becoming <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We should make a big sponge lemon , <vocalsound> and then it'd be it would be yellow . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Th that's very good . It's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . So something like that we we should do . Glow-in-the-dark . Okay . And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . Well , that's good . Mm . <vocalsound> That's what we kind of predicted anyway . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . Okay . So that should also be taken into consideration . Okay . So these are my views . Okay . Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , So <disfmarker> you can <vocalsound> <disfmarker> No it ca <vocalsound> y a <gap> <disfmarker> Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Okay . Quite disposable . Yeah . Okay . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , Oh okay . because our company is very well <gap> for taking all these concerns into consideration , Alright , okay . Uh-huh . so we don't want to have any harm to the society , Okay . so <disfmarker> Fashion . <vocalsound> Cool . <vocalsound> Mm 'kay . So that's all . <vocalsound> Fruit and veg , well there you go . <vocalsound> Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . A remote control ? Yeah . <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? S uh we didn't find out any such point . Or was it just <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so <disfmarker> Mm-mm-mm-mm . Cool . Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . F_ , what is it ? Um . Function F_ eight . <gap> yeah . Hmm . Okay . <gap> Yeah . <gap> <gap> No signal . Oh no , <vocalsound> <gap> . Is that <gap> ? No , it's got it's got it . Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . <vocalsound> Excuse me . <gap> <gap> Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , and then F_ five , right ? Uh , yeah <gap> . Okay . Um okay , so the interface concept um . Yeah . The interface specification , what people <disfmarker> um how they interact with it basically , I think . Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the <disfmarker> what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Um and what <vocalsound> the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . Mm 'kay . <vocalsound> Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . <vocalsound> <gap> either . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . Uh okay . Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . So I think for our remote control <disfmarker> There is some inconsistency already in <disfmarker> ec existing in <disfmarker> between remote controls , but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . Right , okay . Yeah . And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . <vocalsound> Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just <disfmarker> Excellent . Uh no just escape Escape , okay . should uh <disfmarker> Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . Yeah , okay . So these are the <disfmarker> some of the pictures of existing ones . <vocalsound> Wow . I'll just walk you through them . This one is a voice recognition . And that's the kind of idea we're going for . 'Kay . Looks pretty complicated . There's um an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could <disfmarker> I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . Right , okay . This one is <disfmarker> got a kind of scroll like a mouse , Mm-hmm , like the middle button . which <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Um and <disfmarker> But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , <vocalsound> like would the computer come <disfmarker> Ah it's kinda like scrolling <disfmarker> uh right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um <vocalsound> menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , is it ? Right , okay . But the one below that has got like <vocalsound> a little scroll function on the side . But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . Yeah , presumably . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think that's what that is . So these are just a few ideas . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . <vocalsound> Uh it looks threatening . Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . <vocalsound> It looks like Hmm . Um this one I thought was really cool . yeah <gap> . It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . You can put it in there , <vocalsound> it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . Okay . And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . I think something like that would be good . Wow . Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um <vocalsound> , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . Of course yellow . <vocalsound> Right , yeah . So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . Yeah , that's true . Yeah . Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I don't think that will sell very well . I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I guess so . I don't know . I think that's a bit <disfmarker> Strange . <vocalsound> Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah exactly . No they do , they do . They listen to it . Yeah . They do ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . And um this one <vocalsound> is just pointing out . I like <vocalsound> some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but <gap> pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . Right , okay . So that could <disfmarker> that's a bit confusing . Um but the buttons on this I think are <disfmarker> it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . They don't have to be all the same . So that's quite cool . Um . 'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? Yeah , exactly . Um F_ five . Yes . So there are some of the findings . So we need to combine those ones um <vocalsound> and I've just got <vocalsound> an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . Brilliant . That's handy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . Um so <vocalsound> I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . It's <disfmarker> you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , Okay . so that's <disfmarker> And it's much <disfmarker> Yeah . So that's quite cool . Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> The L_C_D_ Yeah . and the other stuff uh , I think . And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ? But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . Uh-huh . Okay . Uh-huh . But our budget , we've <disfmarker> Uh yeah . It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . Yeah . Yeah . So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . Uh-huh . Okay . I'm not sure if the <disfmarker> if <vocalsound> for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , <gap> . Okay . Ben bana Yeah . I can't see tha Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got <disfmarker> I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , <gap> The L_C_D_ . so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . But I mean like I I <disfmarker> the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . <vocalsound> No . Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have <disfmarker> now have colour L_C_D_ screens , w I ju I mean Yeah . S Hmm . I wouldn't know about the costs of them . Uh-huh . But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? Twelve fifty . And the <disfmarker> Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa <vocalsound> Possibly . Yeah , that's the thing , because <disfmarker> But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? Yeah . You're looking at the T_V_ Yeah . Yeah . and and it's uh <disfmarker> That's true , yeah . It just seems kind of like a a needless th And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . Right . It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um <vocalsound> the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of <disfmarker> we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . <vocalsound> Yeah . So which vegetable ? <vocalsound> Well I mean we could make a <disfmarker> Yeah , I know , carrot <vocalsound> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> The the lemon . Yeah . Well what are the options ? And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But we don't want it to be <disfmarker> Yeah . Um the child-friendly , yeah . Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . Mm-hmm . I think that's a good idea to go for . I like I like the colourful buttons as well . Yeah . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um . Yeah . I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , Yeah . so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . S yeah . So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . Yeah . Um so there you go . And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh . So that's um the user interface 'Kay . design . <vocalsound> <gap> So okay , I'll take this out now then . Okay . Um so There you go . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , Yeah , looks like it . and I'll I'll give you the uh , <vocalsound> I guess , technical considerations for those . Mm . <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> <gap> And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it <vocalsound> . Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . So , the way I'm gonna do this <vocalsound> is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , <vocalsound> and then we'll throw in our new innovations um <vocalsound> and keep it all within budget . <vocalsound> Magic man . So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . Um this is what they sent me . 'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose . <vocalsound> Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , Mm-hmm . um <vocalsound> and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? and ch Right , it's very <disfmarker> they're very cheap remote . This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , Mm-hmm . Right . and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . Oh here it is . <vocalsound> Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh <disfmarker> Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . They gotta be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Almost a key-ring . <gap> Right . So this is what we need to have for certain . <vocalsound> Okay . Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , um latex , double-curved , curved . <vocalsound> So lots of choices , 'Kay . what do we think ? Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . Well . Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . Organic sponge . <vocalsound> Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . Um <disfmarker> Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . Yeah . Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability and Yeah . Um . and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . Yeah so <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic <disfmarker> initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? Okay so , here are a a plastic , uh latex <disfmarker> I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and <disfmarker> Oh right , okay . Oh right . I don't know what that stuff is . <vocalsound> So something with give to it . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . And and the colour is yellow , right ? Yeah , Or at least incorporating , yeah . <vocalsound> y <vocalsound> yellow incorporated , yeah . Yellow <vocalsound> , okay . Um . I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh <disfmarker> I don't know what other standard silver kind of <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> Mm . Other parts or uh <disfmarker> Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours Mm-hmm . or i if we're having buttons actually , Mm' kay . So yellow for the body , I don Um . and then what colour for the buttons ? Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . Yeah . So multi-coloured buttons . You do have ones like um play <vocalsound> could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . <gap> Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . <vocalsound> Makes it easy to use . Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel <disfmarker> I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , Okay . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . a bit comfier , you know . Yeah . Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go <disfmarker> Um how exactly ? Maybe double <disfmarker> Like uh <vocalsound> an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , or just like a <disfmarker> Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be <disfmarker> that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . It's not <disfmarker> What about a banana ? Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We could make novelty remote controls . Yeah ? Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , Well , yeah , I mean like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'cause it's yellow fruit , Yeah , yeah . right ? Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . But then how would you point it ? Ah <gap> yeah . Mm-hmm . How would you point it ? Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . What <disfmarker> We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . <vocalsound> Yeah , I appreciate this idea , They only cost pennies . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> because then this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> this will help us in our advertisement also <vocalsound> and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . That what our data shows that , Yeah . so this w this w <gap> y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea . Huh ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . So a spongy banana re <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean that that th <vocalsound> Rubber banana . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , okay . I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ? Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , <vocalsound> S See <disfmarker> like people uh now <disfmarker> And sponginess . And spongy , yeah . So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable Spongy . Yeah . Yeah . like so it would have a stem perhaps and a Maybe , yeah . maybe a <disfmarker> it'd be s axially symmetric . Huh . Like what's what's that <vocalsound> , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like <disfmarker> looks like a little snowman kind of thing . I don't know the name of that . So it'd look like this kinda . Yeah , that's what I was thinking . Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? Uh . Yeah , maybe that's what they are . <gap> 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and <disfmarker> Yeah , and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , why the hell not . <vocalsound> Let's <vocalsound> I don't know . that'll make us fifty million Euros . What do you guy <disfmarker> What do you think ? <vocalsound> Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , No . Yeah . Yeah . yeah ? Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or <disfmarker> Yeah . Exactly . Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . Uh-huh . There's a good man . There's a good idea . Okay . Okay . Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that . <vocalsound> We'll uh <disfmarker> Okay , we could do that . Um . Okay . And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ? <gap> Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . Mm . Okay , so They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um so buttons . things that are always used . <gap> <vocalsound> Okay , just like that . <vocalsound> That's cool . Yeah . <vocalsound> I like it . Okay . Um . <vocalsound> With the scroll-wheel or no ? Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? <vocalsound> Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . Okay uh I could put the microphone here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay there's the microphone . Yeah . Where should I put the microphone ? I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? Yeah , I'm not sure . Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . <vocalsound> Glad , we're not doing this for real . Um yeah , I can <disfmarker> no I'm not sure . Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? I couldn Yeah . Yeah . Okay . And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is <gap> the microphone <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or <disfmarker> I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . 'Kay there's the mic . So it can be sort of held and w <gap> <vocalsound> That's cool . <vocalsound> <disfmarker> We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . Um n well we can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Whoops . <vocalsound> Oops . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . Um . So let's not use the whiteboard any more . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> Upsidaisy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oops , sorry . Okay . And uh so what else was there ? Um the <disfmarker> What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are we just gonna leave that ? <vocalsound> I s I still like it . Um but that's me . <vocalsound> You still like it . 'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . Right . Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . 'Cause um it could <disfmarker> Yeah . Um don't wanna sort of overkill . Especially with yellow <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Mm . I dunno . Hmm . 'Cause I mean like uh if we <disfmarker> I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? <gap> <gap> <vocalsound> They can work from a <disfmarker> Yeah , you know , and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . You don't have to hold it . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> Yeah . you know they have uh fruits all round them . Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah . <vocalsound> Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . Yeah . I mean uh <vocalsound> some uh I Yeah , do we need buttons ? l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple . Mm . Then it's just apple so sort of <disfmarker> Uh , yellow apples though <disfmarker> Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite <disfmarker> got a quite steady base . <gap> Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good . Groovy . Okay . But yeah <disfmarker> Um and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . <vocalsound> Yeah , <gap> . <vocalsound> <gap> But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . Yeah . Okay . So <vocalsound> I mean like you could actually <disfmarker> Yeah , gives you the options . Or we can <disfmarker> we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , Mm-hmm . So a selection of casings . it will look l <vocalsound> Uh yeah . Yeah , In that w It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um <disfmarker> 'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ? S s sorry ? You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice . <gap> Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , Yeah . okay ? Like like mobiles , yeah . If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . Yeah . If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put <disfmarker> we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . Okay . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , <gap> Okay . without <disfmarker> uh yeah . We still need the buttons in the same places thought , Yeah , don't we ? button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . You can standardise those , I mean . <gap> Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay . Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the <disfmarker> Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay . Yeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of <disfmarker> from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . Okay , okay . So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . Okay . Yeah yeah . I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , And <disfmarker> 'cause when <disfmarker> if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really <disfmarker> Mm mm . You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , <vocalsound> Yeah . unless you have sort of <disfmarker> you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Maybe . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> Okay , um so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . Yeah , <vocalsound> s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , Yeah . Yeah . and the colours we got down , Yeah . and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , um because <disfmarker> Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because <vocalsound> what <disfmarker> Okay , so we stick with what we've got there . Yeah , w I think wh wha would <disfmarker> we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a <disfmarker> too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , Mm 'kay . because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Okay . So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different Yeah . Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . colour , but have <disfmarker> kinda going round , yeah . Mm . Because <disfmarker> Um I mean e even if <disfmarker> I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . Yeah . So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . Yeah . Yeah . Uh-huh . Mm-hmm . W sort of <disfmarker> Great . <vocalsound> Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . We can use a hand-dynamo . Um I don't know what that means , Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda <vocalsound> powers it . we crank it ? <vocalsound> Right , it's like those watches that you c Uh yeah . So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . Oh , a d a dynamo ? Yeah , <gap> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , I like that , yeah . <gap> Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . Yeah . Yeah that's quite cool . Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . <vocalsound> Okay . But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You shake it and scream at it . Yeah . But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? Yeah , it is , yeah . Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat It does leave them with an obligation to <disfmarker> Yeah , to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . mo Yeah . Yeah , Then if it's just sitting on the <disfmarker> because most of the people <disfmarker> Right . Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , okay . That's true . Okay . Right um what are the other options ? Uh there's solar power . Um . Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , Yeah . Yeah . and the days when there is no sola sunlight <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , Yeah . Yeah . I think , you know , Okay , so probably just <disfmarker> <gap> I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . What we w yeah . But w <vocalsound> like just normal light ? I think we should <disfmarker> a rechargeable <vocalsound> battery will be a good idea . Oh that's true . They can they can recharge it . <vocalsound> I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought <vocalsound> um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother Mm . And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? is having a , yeah , having a rechargeable stand , Yeah . so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as <disfmarker> uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . 'Kay . Like like a hand <disfmarker> like one of those portable phones kind of thing . Yeah that kind of thing . Yeah , that's <disfmarker> Yeah , exactly . Okay . So uh a rechargeable battery <gap> . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Rechargeable . Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . Mm . <gap> . What's chip on print ? Um . What's <disfmarker> Hmm ? Sorry , never mind . <vocalsound> Uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um <disfmarker> Oops , this one . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , Mm-hmm . which adds to the cost as you can expect . Mm-hmm . Um . But uh I think we can keep it all under budget . So uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . Mm-hmm . So just in time . <vocalsound> Yeah , Just in time . and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . Right , right . That's good . Uh woah . Yeah , Okay , we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um <vocalsound> and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out . <vocalsound> Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . Um we're kind of running out of time , so if you could <disfmarker> Uh . <vocalsound> Was that you ? Um that was <disfmarker> your bit's covered , Huh ? I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next . Oh yeah that was that was it . Uh excuse me , Bri <gap> Um , yeah . So control F_ eight , right ? Oh , yeah . Yeah , mine seems to have turned off . I can't do anything . And I just touch the pad . You just touch the pad , yeah . No . <vocalsound> It's actually shut down . No ? It's on , but there's nothing on the screen . Okay , um now what we have <disfmarker> Try uh flipping the screen down <gap> . uh our next meeting's in half an hour 'Kay . and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . Oh , <vocalsound> I get to do it , too . <vocalsound> Yeah . It's you guys . Yeah . Cool . <vocalsound> Oh neat . So um , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape . Yeah . Mm . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . Okay . <gap> That's great . Okay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ? Uh yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Which doesn't really help me much . I think , I've saved mine already . Yeah , can you save that <disfmarker> uh send that last one again , please , Raj , as I still can't find it on the <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh it was under a different name . <vocalsound> I will show you , in shared documents . Okay . Uh working components <gap> . Oh , you didn't get that . No . I will send new . Okay , thank you . Uh I'll put it in shared documents , again . Um yeah , Project , Project Documents . Project documents , sorry , I put it in the shared documents . Uh right , that's that's the that <disfmarker> Uh yeah . it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . Project Documents is on the um <vocalsound> desktop . Right , that's great . But I cou can't open that , because it w asks uh for some username or password . Oh <gap> . Really ? <gap> <gap> I'll show you . Uh these lapel mics are trouble . Ts Oh right , I think um <disfmarker> Hold on . Sorry . Uh . <vocalsound> Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um on my agenda . S <vocalsound> Um presumably there's clay somewhere . Um . <vocalsound> Four . Yeah , that's great . Whoops . Light , light , please . Light . <vocalsound> Right , there you go . Yeah , th thank you . Yeah , quite . And we're using this our basic chip set , so it's all good . <vocalsound> Oh sorry . Are we done with our meeting ? Uh excuse me , Brian . Um I think we're almost done , yeah . You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen . Yeah . Oh oops . Sorry man . S <vocalsound> Uh okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and <disfmarker> Uh . Apples . <vocalsound> Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . 'Kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . What's supplements ? Supplements . Uh <vocalsound> uh . <vocalsound> See . <vocalsound> Cool . Fun . I shoulda <gap> something like that . If I kn see I I knew that . I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Just for cruelty . <vocalsound> Yeah . Star fruit . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything . So sh should No . Should we leave now , Brian ? Oh yeah , we can do buttons . Or we are going to discuss something ? Um . Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions <vocalsound> or confusions , <vocalsound> No I'm good . 'cause I'm confused . Yeah . Huh ? Okay . Excuse me . <vocalsound> Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Sorry . Thank you . Yeah . There we go . Warning , finish meeting now . So . I rounded it up far too fast . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> . Where are we going ? My Documents , that's not what I want . My Project Documents . <vocalsound> There we go .
Right , so start of the first meeting . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Uh . Right , so agenda of the first meeting . Where we uh <disfmarker> We have twenty five minutes for this meeting . Okay . We uh are to get acquainted . So does everyone want to say who they are ? <gap> that seem sensible ? Yeah . I'm Robin . I'm the Marketing Manager . I'm Louisa . I'm the User Interface Designer . I'm Nick . I am the Industrial Designer . And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader . <vocalsound> Alright okay , so tool training . Um . <vocalsound> Project plan . So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required ? Tool training I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training . Neither am I <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh I see , so we shouldn't really be <disfmarker> Oh right okay , so . So we have the project team , which is to um <vocalsound> basically to come up with a new r remote control device . <gap> Uh we have uh <disfmarker> the starting base was the original <vocalsound> which has been in existence now for a period of time . And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to <vocalsound> to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . <vocalsound> Yeah . So um <vocalsound> method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh <vocalsound> the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . So um <vocalsound> in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh this device . Yes . And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before . And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . Um and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end . Mm-hmm , okay . So we've got tool training . Try out whiteboard . Uh . <vocalsound> So we will um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . So uh I don't know who wishes to go first . Okay <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever . I don't mind . <vocalsound> I dunno . <vocalsound> Um . Ah uh . <vocalsound> Let's see . <gap> Good job I got pockets today . Your microphone's just <disfmarker> But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera . I take it that <disfmarker> Are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ? I would <vocalsound> I would guess so . Or <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . I don't know . You've lost uh your microphone there . Oh . <vocalsound> Technical problems . Right here we go . <gap> I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . Little smiley cat there . Um and this would be because they're very independent , uh they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> and they can be very very affectionate . Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats . Um . Um and they can look after themselves . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Next . <vocalsound> Okay , yeah . I'll I'll <disfmarker> Shall I rub that out , actually ? I don't see as there's any need to . There's plenty of space . <gap> I mean whatever . <vocalsound> We can have have a whole menagerie . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Exactly . <vocalsound> Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything . Okay . There's one . We've had more time to prepare over this side , so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Didn't think of that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay uh The three pens are underneath . pens are over here . I'll try the red pen . Okay . Um . <vocalsound> I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm <gap> be able to draw very well , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but I'll have a bash at it . <vocalsound> You get marks for artistic impression . <vocalsound> Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ooh ooh <gap> I lost it there . I think I've just knocked the microphone . <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you're just doing the face . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Great . <vocalsound> Right . Hello . Um I'm gonna go for the dog , and I'm gonna draw one badly as well . Uh . <gap> looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something . That's quite good . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . There's my dog . Um <vocalsound> I like dogs because they're very loyal . And they're always happy , so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . And they're also good for exercise as well . You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , that's why I like dogs . <vocalsound> Right , um . <vocalsound> Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh <gap> I'm not too keen on them anyway . Not to worry . So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw . <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well . <vocalsound> Anyway um . <vocalsound> And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . <vocalsound> Other than the fact that they keep dying , <vocalsound> uh fish are uh <vocalsound> are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Great . <vocalsound> Right . Okay , uh if we're still all with us . Right okay , so . Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price . Mm-hmm . That information has come from our marketing manager here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe . We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit . And therefore making a profit margin of uh <disfmarker> well not actually a profit margin it's uh <disfmarker> because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit . And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . <gap> So um <disfmarker> Experience with remote control , first ideas . New remote . So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were . Yes . <gap> So uh any any thoughts ? Um I <gap> with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . As that is the main function . Okay , so so basically we're looking for some um <disfmarker> we're looking for a device that is um robust Yes . and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily . Um we're looking for a device that is uh <disfmarker> What was the other things you said there ? Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . Easy to use . Use . <gap> is easy to use and see . And see . Yes . Okay . Uh . Can I just check ? <vocalsound> Is this just a television remote ? Because a lot of um systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined . And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . Mm-hmm . So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . <gap> Mm . Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ? Oh I w um <gap> basically I'll get back to you on that . <vocalsound> But it seems to me sensible , 'cause <disfmarker> as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . Yeah . And uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So a device for for all remotes . <gap> I've Sorry , you go . You go . Okay . Yeah . Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . And um sometimes uh they sort of <disfmarker> remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . So <disfmarker> whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Comes to your whistle . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But is it <disfmarker> in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive . You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to <disfmarker> Yeah . 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . Yeah . Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . Mm-hmm . And so these are probably mutually exclusive options Yes . that uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more <gap> with handling them , Yeah . therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ? <gap> Better instructions . Yeah . I mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . Mm-hmm . So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where <disfmarker> you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of <disfmarker> you can link it to that as well , maybe . Okay . Um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting . So uh we have to uh start winding up . Um is there <disfmarker> Next meeting in thirty minutes . 'Kay . Okay . So um <disfmarker> Right , so we've got I_D_ the <disfmarker> Come on , where's my <disfmarker> If you just click return it should be okay . It'll get rid of the message . <vocalsound> Or not . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message . <vocalsound> Oh there we go . Oh you've got <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's what I was looking for . Right . So we've got function <disfmarker> Oh what happened to the <disfmarker> I think that might be back to the start . Yeah . Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down ? <gap> slide four <gap> Yeah . Right . Right . Okay . <vocalsound> Sorry about that . <vocalsound> Okay , so we've got um the working design for I_D_ . For U_I_D_ the technical functions design . Marketing , the user requirement specification . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . So . Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting . Yes . 'Kay , yes . Mm-hmm . I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , Television remote control . so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . Right . That's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change <vocalsound> where we're going . Okay cool . But at this point in time I think you're right that uh <disfmarker> shall we make it just a T_V_ . Okay ? 'Kay So we will depart . <vocalsound> We will stay here and uh and break off . And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour . Okay , that's great . Okay . Okay cheers . Okay . Right s
<vocalsound> Hello . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Dang it . <vocalsound> And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot . Alright . <gap> It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here . Okay . No , that's okay . Joost , your mouse . What ? No mouse needed ? I've got a touch-pad . Do you know how how I can wake it up ? Mm . A touch-pad ? No , my laptop . Slap it . <vocalsound> You with your brilliant ideas . I don't know if I can touch the power button . Do you know how how I can wake it up ? Is <disfmarker> No . Yeah . Try the power button . Oh . <vocalsound> Come on , move it . Um <disfmarker> Now , wake up , bitch . Huh . F_ five . F_ five <gap> . I've lost my screen . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , so did I . I closed it . I don't . That wasn that wasn't very smart , I guess . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Come on . Get back to me . Yes . Yes . <vocalsound> I closed the <disfmarker> I closed it . You've got your name . <vocalsound> Yeah , my name is name . No , I didn't restart it , I just closed it . Yes . Hope it working . Alright . No . Never close your laptop . Yeah ? Everybody's ready ? Great . Thanks . Yeah . Great . Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . I uh forgot to put my name over here , it's uh <vocalsound> it's Martin . Uh , so you all know . <vocalsound> Well , this is the agenda for today . Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . <vocalsound> Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes . Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . Mm-hmm . Uh , some of the <vocalsound> oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . So now we all know what our Okay . goal is . Um , I <disfmarker> oh forget <disfmarker> I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Joost , Guido , Antek . Yes . What is your name ? Yes . Antek . Antek Ahmet . And Joost . <gap> Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . Okay . Yeah . Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , Yes . Yes . so I don't have to tell you about that . Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um <disfmarker> there's a document folder called um the sh <vocalsound> shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? No , no . Just on the on the screen over there . No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but <disfmarker> Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop <gap> . Is is <disfmarker> if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's <disfmarker> I don't know if it's important . Okay . This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here . It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we <disfmarker> well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If pen is selected , yes . Oh , no no . With that pen ? It's not <disfmarker> But it is pen . It's not working like a pen yet . Mm . Huh . Huh . Mm . It's doing some stuff now . Little bit slower . So you can use a pen . You can use an eraser . And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . So , it's quite easy . Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools . Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright . Oh , let me think . Different colours . Oh . <vocalsound> Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish . <vocalsound> piranha . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Oh . I'm gonna use some different colour <gap> now . Some <disfmarker> a little white . Looks like a fish . Think it is . Oh . <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Uh , colour . This is black ? I think so . Yellow <gap> <disfmarker> Oh . <vocalsound> Oh , this is just uh <vocalsound> useless uh drawings but <disfmarker> Oh teeth . I need teeth . <vocalsound> Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is . <vocalsound> Hmm . Okay . What was uh <disfmarker> I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Different . Well , I like its uh sharp <disfmarker> razor sharp teeth . <vocalsound> Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . And I like its overall uh aggressive look and <disfmarker> Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . Okay . I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be . Well , who wants to be next ? Nobody , I guess . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh <disfmarker> You go , Guido ? Okay . Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank . Blank ? Yep . Okay . <vocalsound> Then pen again ? Yep . Okay . And uh <disfmarker> so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths . Okay , um <disfmarker> Format . <gap> control . Uh <disfmarker> Ah , purple . <vocalsound> Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is , but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I will <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You know , I thought of that actually . <vocalsound> That's my bird . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah ? Yeah . Isn't it quite <disfmarker> it's a little bit light . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , another colour maybe . A red one . A small one . Uh , line width . Two ? Three . Oh that's okay . That's another one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds . <vocalsound> Ano <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> uh <vocalsound> it's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Its simplicity . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . Oh , okay . Okay . Maybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know . Okay . No , uh it's clear . So <gap> more uh birds ? N no <vocalsound> no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We get your point . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> Okay , <vocalsound> okay , <vocalsound> okay . Okay . Who wants to be next ? Yeah , whatever . I'll go next . <vocalsound> Thanks . I haven't got a favourite animal too , so <disfmarker> M Pictionary . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> What should I draw ? <vocalsound> A cow . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thank you , <vocalsound> Okay . I'll draw a penguin . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I'll draw a penguin . Whatever . I can't draw , so you can start to laugh already . <vocalsound> I'll do so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Whatever . Something like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Come on . Yeah , it's little bit hard . Mm hmm hmm , orange . Orange , of course . Whatever . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , <vocalsound> it's better than your bird . <gap> Uh yeah . <vocalsound> Everything's better than your bird . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> True . Whatever . <vocalsound> Hey , it's blue . No . Whatever . Um , I like its ugliness <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , whatever . The way it walks or whatever . Okay . Your turn . <vocalsound> 'Kay . <vocalsound> Drawing . <vocalsound> I'm going to draw a cat . I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal . <vocalsound> And you can have them at home . <gap> Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , you can have a piranha at home . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ye yes , <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Huh . Or a line . <vocalsound> A little bit . <vocalsound> I mean a bird . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Don't mess with my birds , yeah . It's not very uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it . <vocalsound> Hmm . It's a handicapped cat . <vocalsound> <gap> cat . <vocalsound> I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah , it's not scared . He's crying but <disfmarker> <gap> . <vocalsound> He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What do you like about it then ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh it's i most cats are small . Oh , okay . You can handle them . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Okay , Okay . and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I wouldn't call it training , but <disfmarker> Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah ? Okay . <vocalsound> Alright . Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when <disfmarker> well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh <disfmarker> know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ? Yes . Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ? Hmm . I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . Yeah , okay . Different . Okay . And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh <disfmarker> Different functions of of uh <disfmarker> Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this <vocalsound> <disfmarker> or whatever o o other functions <vocalsound> totally somewhere else . Okay . I think we should group them . Yeah . And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t Okay . And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um <disfmarker> what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . Yeah . It's what , from my experience . But isn't it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television . Okay . But we gonna <disfmarker> It's only for television , I thought . Not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes . Oh , it is only for televis <gap> I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . Yes , it is only for television , but uh <disfmarker> So wha what <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> What wha <vocalsound> what uh what document <disfmarker> well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it . But , where where did it uh <disfmarker> Where did you find that ? Uh , in the email . Oh , okay . That's right . It's a television remote control . I thought it said uh <disfmarker> But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ <disfmarker> Yeah , television remote control . Yes , <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . Yes , that's uh something extras . So we can <disfmarker> No , we have to think about that . True . Yeah . True . Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or <disfmarker> Yep . Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah . I guess . Only the experts . <vocalsound> True . Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the <disfmarker> uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . Yeah . <gap> That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then . <vocalsound> Oh my God . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ? Uh , to go with to go with fashion and <disfmarker> Maybe a can opener underneath it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> For the bear . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh <disfmarker> I I uh , no I think it <disfmarker> Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . Yeah , way too high . Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . Yep . It's international , so we have to use a standard . Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh <disfmarker> Well , m has to be something <vocalsound> spectacular or uh one which makes it <disfmarker> Well that's an idea of course , yeah . We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh , Mm-hmm . original , trendly , and user-friendly <disfmarker> Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . Hmm . No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . <vocalsound> Yeah . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that . 'Kay , so you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . Use friendly . Yep . Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . <vocalsound> Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some <disfmarker> <gap> Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . Yeah . Yes , what the market wishes . Okay . Well , the closing . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh <disfmarker> Already s said that . The User Interface Designer <vocalsound> <disfmarker> is it a User Inter User Interface <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Interface d Yeah . <vocalsound> the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh <disfmarker> the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . <vocalsound> I don't know how much time we have left . Oh , not many I guess . We started at twelve . You just got a message . Oh , and what does it said ? And it said uh five minutes , so we got four and a half . Oh , I don't <disfmarker> W Okay , well um <disfmarker> I didn't get a message . No . He's the whatever . Oh , the Project Manager . Team Leader . <vocalsound> No , we're uh ahead of schedule then . Team Leader . <vocalsound> He is the whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah , close it . I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Yes . And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . Okay . You can all <disfmarker> Or we're all uh <disfmarker> Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board . Yeah . Yeah , but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ? Yeah . Yes . Yeah . Yeah , okay . I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down Alright . and then we're ready . Okay . Or we can leave already <gap> I guess . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> or uh or sh or should we uh <disfmarker> or is important that we leave at exact uh <disfmarker> No . No . Okay . I don't think so . <vocalsound> I don't think <disfmarker> Oh <disfmarker> Yes ? Yes . <vocalsound> Great . Oh . We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes . <vocalsound> Yeah . Good luck . <vocalsound> Yeah , good luck . I will need it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I will need it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> Are you sure I got it all <disfmarker> head's kinda small . How're we placed in terms of the <disfmarker> Okay . <gap> alright . We're okay ? <vocalsound> Guess I should probably try to sit up straight . <vocalsound> Like that ? Okay , cool . We're good ? Oh , I think mine's fallen off . It fell <disfmarker> That's why . I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> Uh okay . Ah . Okay ? <vocalsound> Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . <vocalsound> Wow . Yeah , PowerPoint . Very official . Yeah , well , you know , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it <vocalsound> right . Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um <vocalsound> We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start <disfmarker> talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I <gap> guess you know game or something um <vocalsound> in real life um so yeah basically I want to <disfmarker> I'm just gonna <disfmarker> you got <disfmarker> of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um <vocalsound> uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . <vocalsound> Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , <vocalsound> You're just gonna believe me , um <vocalsound> y is <vocalsound> we'll go from there . Exactly . Fair enough . Um I mean obvi if if you guys <disfmarker> if if at the same time if you <disfmarker> like logically if something doesn't <disfmarker> like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like Prove it yeah , okay . <vocalsound> yeah yeah exactly so , 'cause we're <disfmarker> what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well <vocalsound> um . And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um <vocalsound> uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , <vocalsound> why not , <vocalsound> you know you can <disfmarker> this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ? Oh yeah , that's fine . Sure . Works for me . Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that <vocalsound> we're totally <disfmarker> we're making a remote control which is thrilling Right . um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the <disfmarker> in real life I dunno if you guys uh <vocalsound> checked the um <vocalsound> uh the corporate website . Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . <vocalsound> Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um <vocalsound> um the other designer that I can't remember , <vocalsound> the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um <vocalsound> the Industrial Designer <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> hey right on alright , Mm . There you go . getting into it um to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be <disfmarker> you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um <vocalsound> I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me <vocalsound> tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down <disfmarker> I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you <disfmarker> if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . Oh , we skipped introductions . Nice . <vocalsound> I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm Marty , um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . Um yeah . So <disfmarker> I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . Marketing , Expert <vocalsound> yeah Expert . Expert . Don't play yourself down . <vocalsound> Fine . Expert <vocalsound> That's me . I'm Ron . I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer . I'm Nathan , I'm from California , and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology . Where did you go to uni Nathan ? <vocalsound> U_C_L_A_ . Oh brilliant . Cool . Yeah . My little brother goes there . Okay . Right so desert island discs . So . Yeah . So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ? Well I'm waiting to know . I'll t i no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , Uh <disfmarker> I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but Fair enough . there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut like I am like Smallville terrible television show <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , Smallville . but I happen to love it , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it's rubbish but I love it . I went to high school with Tom Willing actually . T the the main c the main character ? The guy . Yeah . Wow . Is he a wanker ? Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very much so . Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless . He looks really tall , like he's gotta be like six six . Yeah . He is a big guy . Yeah . Yeah . Um okay so <vocalsound> I really like Jeff Buckley . You guys heard of Jeff Buckley ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have . Um <vocalsound> and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead . <vocalsound> It's a r Good call . <vocalsound> Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think . It's kinda weird . Anyway Interesting . yeah . Yeah , you're like press and it's <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Kinda cool . <vocalsound> You'll see . Alright so um <vocalsound> whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . I guess I'll go next then . Go for it . Right on . Okay . Don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . Okay . This is basically just pen practice huh ? W Okay . Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here . Um . Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate , Mm . local Michigan folk singer , Nice . Wow . really lame and uh <vocalsound> uh what else did I bring with me ? Probably classical , to totally geek it out , Okay yeah yeah . yeah I think . And my family guy D_V_D_s Well but we don't need to write that one down . yeah . Oh , family guy . <vocalsound> Isn't h has h do you watch the new season ? No . Are you getting it online , or is it on sky ? <vocalsound> I think I'm gonna start downloading it yeah . Yeah , that'd be nice . Alright . Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_ . Anybody ? Mm-mm . No . No ? <gap> no ? 'Fraid not . Afro beat orchestra , very cool . Afro beat orchestra ? Yeah . Very cool . Mm . Mm . Fift S Sounds nice . they like fifteen members from Brooklyn . Um and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium , in Brussels in April first . Wow . Exciting . Yeah . It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways . That'd be <gap> . Um thing I love about Edinburgh <disfmarker> Oh . I didn't even read those . Oops . I shouldn't admit that . <vocalsound> That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for . It's they're designed specifically to ignore . I <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> th brilliant . Oh , wow . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's the five by five , I can't read that much . Ah yes yes yes okay I see that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah Vomit . Yes . <vocalsound> oh it's so horrible . <vocalsound> Love um <disfmarker> Street pizza . It's so brilliant . <vocalsound> I've seen more urine in this city than ever before , Oh my God . <vocalsound> I just came from Glasgow I mean <disfmarker> Seriously ? and I'm um happy to say that there's the <disfmarker> there's the same quantity approximately . There's more vomit there . Um . It's so minging . I w It really is <vocalsound> Uh . Does uh yeah . Ready ? Alright . Yep . Minging ? Nice . Yeah . I'm going local . Going local . Slide it in there . Yeah . I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right . Yeah fair enough . I've already got more than I can keep track of . And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people , Oh , have you been home yet ? <vocalsound> no . They'll be like , say something British , and you're like oh shut up family . <vocalsound> I know . I know . Uh-huh . Um <disfmarker> Oh it should be interesting . Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back . Let's see . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right They're gonna love that one . you s you're gonna stay here ? Probably . Or at least get a work visa for a while Wow . and then decide . <vocalsound> Nice . 'Cause <disfmarker> Bad religion ? Yeah , nice . that's the music I grew up listening to . Of course . Yeah yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Oh , And so there <disfmarker> now I can think of so many other ones . Well yeah that's why <disfmarker> That's how it works . yeah . Something I miss about my hometown . I miss coffee . Burritos Mm . <vocalsound> Nice . <vocalsound> Burritos . Oh <disfmarker> that cost less than eight Pounds . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Any thing that are like free . Oh yeah two two bucks . Where are you from in California by the way ? <vocalsound> I grew up in San Diego , but Did you really ? What part ? yeah um La Jolla , P_B_ <gap> . Yeah I'm from San Diego as well . Nice . <vocalsound> Yeah oh man . But really uh I last lived in San Francisco , I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen . Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego . It's different . 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them . It must make all the difference . <vocalsound> Yeah , it really does . Well it's it's <vocalsound> i there's other things too there's <disfmarker> you just can't place it Ah . like I <disfmarker> when I went to school in the U_ <disfmarker> in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good like Mm . and yeah it's like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive <disfmarker> Right . I miss yeah good call on that . Yeah . Where you from in San Diego ? Mm . Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo . Okay . So North Park actually if you want to get real specific . Yeah , my grandparents lived on um thirty second . Yep . Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , Yes . and On university , yeah . Cafe Forte <disfmarker> Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . Cool . Yeah , pretty cool . Small world Yeah . as we were discussing before . Especially when we're all from the same general region . Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . There you go . You can harness the awesome power <vocalsound> Wow . a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um right so <vocalsound> <vocalsound> moving on to not fun stuff <vocalsound> uh project finance . <vocalsound> Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . <vocalsound> This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . Mm . Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . Eur internationally . So <vocalsound> um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . Okay . Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s Makes sense . Uh . but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing . <vocalsound> Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . <vocalsound> Um s right so um just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . Um . <vocalsound> Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um <vocalsound> and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . Um <vocalsound> U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from <disfmarker> in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um <vocalsound> we <disfmarker> what the user's gonna want . What they're looking for . So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like uh so <disfmarker> And negotiate that . Uh . yeah well it is <vocalsound> and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . Um any questions , before we get started ? I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products . <vocalsound> You mean to like <disfmarker> For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . Mm . Sounds interesting . Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So <disfmarker> Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? Well , Mm . have a think about it . I mean Yep . Okay . I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able W yeah . isn't it . I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of <vocalsound> useful function . Mm-hmm . Yeah . The clapper . No I mean <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> no , good idea , good idea . We'll see what <disfmarker> see what <disfmarker> Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . <vocalsound> Nice . Hot . <vocalsound> I like the little cover thingies . Uh-huh y I like that <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um <disfmarker> I don't really have any . Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . Uh project announcement . Ts ts ts <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Not so much . <vocalsound> Hmm . All right we'll find them , we're on our own . Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do . S does anybody have any initial ideas ? I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause <disfmarker> Good idea . Start your minutes . Um <disfmarker> Yeah I mean oh yeah right . <vocalsound> So initial ideas . <vocalsound> Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right , Yeah . we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door Yeah . or like to have everything on one thing , <vocalsound> but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , you can't tell what they do . S smaller's better . Mm-hmm . Simple . Yeah . But <disfmarker> I'm thinking <disfmarker> I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design Specific . so touch screen design rather than button Okay . Oh right . so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . That'd be different . Interesting . <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> that's slick isn't it . I mean like <vocalsound> stylist <vocalsound> yeah like <vocalsound> a just a True . yeah . Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um <vocalsound> uh size and functionality . Mm . Mm . Um and we also <disfmarker> Right . We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , Yeah . Too confusing . It's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things . I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea Hmm . of um <vocalsound> so you <disfmarker> like <disfmarker> maybe like an L_ <disfmarker> like a touch screen type of remote ? Mm-hmm . Possibly . Mm . I don't think one exists . An interesting option . Be a good idea . Needs <disfmarker> it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes . Yeah . Definitely . Yeah all the other universal remotes . Um <vocalsound> I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one <disfmarker> Right . I'm pretty sure there is . I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ Okay . Okay . that he just points at his telev any television he wants That <disfmarker> and it'll figure out the <vocalsound> the specifications of it Yeah . and will control it <vocalsound> Interesting . Awesome . um so Okay . I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world . Yeah . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Um all right . So . I li I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . Um . Mm-hmm . Right . Um . <vocalsound> Let's see . I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . And <disfmarker> I don't know , like , there's such a problem with losing them , <vocalsound> that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , Mm . so we're gonna have to be careful with what like <disfmarker> Oh . Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . <vocalsound> Uh let's see . Um . I like the idea of the uh multi plate . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah okay . Yeah . Fi b <vocalsound> In in like <vocalsound> what are they called , those face plate things ? Isn't there a name for them ? Think they're just called face plates ? Are they ? <gap> something , I don't know . I dunno . uh we'll have to come up with a name , I like . We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . patent it . Yeah . Something really cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Leopard print or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> For those cold winter days . <vocalsound> Leopard print . <vocalsound> Um . Hmm . I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . True . Mm . But if we're bundling it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> unless we're selling their telly with the remote . Right . Mm . Um <vocalsound> Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . True . If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either <disfmarker> True . well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying . Right . Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um <vocalsound> uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes <vocalsound> , Th Right . Yeah . Yeah . Right . could we do something like that ? <vocalsound> I think so . That's cool . Probably . I think we could design into that . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Good . Um yeah <vocalsound> I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of Mm . Yeah . And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . Mm . you know <disfmarker> Yeah . Curves . Mm . Yeah . We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty <disfmarker> you know it's pretty expensive Right . so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote <vocalsound> Right . that's black and you know m massive , Yeah . some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . Mm . Definitely . But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , Yeah . how we're gonna sell it and um <disfmarker> Or if you our users in mind , like these <disfmarker> grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's <disfmarker> they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , Yeah . and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . <vocalsound> Mm . 'S true . But <disfmarker> We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? Twenty five Euros . Euros . <vocalsound> Slight difference I guess . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> They're all weaker than <disfmarker> they're all stronger than the Dollar . Mm . Although , computer parts , all <disfmarker> if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ? No . Mm-mm . They serve um <disfmarker> right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America Mm . and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um <vocalsound> project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . Okay . Okay . And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into . With half an hour ? Um . Yes . 'Kay . Perfect . Thanks guys . Cool . Thank you . Alright .
<vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , however , um there are some changes that I've got from on high that um Okay . <vocalsound> are a bit uh <disfmarker> well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh <vocalsound> this is for a specific television . Okay . So the all in one idea goes out the window . And <vocalsound> they require that the uh Mm-hmm . actually I'll get to that at the end <gap> point number four , um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . So um , presentations , were you <disfmarker> anybody got , raring to go ? Yeah . Yeah . Raring to go ? Okay . Good stuff . Mm . Um . So how <disfmarker> Oh I need to plug you in . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> S <gap> Wow . <vocalsound> Just about . It's a inspired design . <gap> <vocalsound> Sh do you want me to hold it ? Uh there we go , just screw 'em on in . Gonna have to swap them round so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> now , it was function F_ eight . So , after that ? F_ eight . <vocalsound> f oh sorry F_ eight . That's the wee blue one . Blue one F_ eight . Should do it , good one . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure . Hold on , sorry . <gap> and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . Yeah , yeah . Uh actually , sorry I have to see the other <gap> , sorry . <vocalsound> Sorry , uh . Yeah , thank you . <vocalsound> Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? Then <disfmarker> P press F_ five to start it first . Sorry . Okay . Yeah , I can , okay . Hmm . <vocalsound> Jesus . Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . And what we got was , we found that <disfmarker> if you <disfmarker> uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . They are not so good looking . So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available <disfmarker> uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . Excellent . Then <disfmarker> <gap> And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . So we have to take care of this fact also . Then . Uh it was function I want to go to . Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape . Uh , escape , okay thank you . Then if we look at this slide , Okay . uh these are in your shared documents , you can see , Okay . like <disfmarker> Uh , sorry . So , sorry <disfmarker> I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? Or is <disfmarker> are you coming on to that ? Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . Okay . So these percentages are are what ? Yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , I can open it in another way . Okay . Speech recognition . Uh , yes . If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . <vocalsound> So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , Hmm . and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . Hmm . So we should look <disfmarker> We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . <gap> Yeah . We can look at that that factor also , so yes . <vocalsound> Uh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of . Mm , mm . Yeah . So , and <disfmarker> <gap> <gap> <vocalsound> And then <disfmarker> Fifteen to twe Yes . I think so . <vocalsound> Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people <disfmarker> consumers could easily learn . They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls . Mm-hmm . So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . So um this is all about Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh market potential by me . Mm-hmm . Uh , yes , th thank you . Okay , thank you . Um , <vocalsound> follow on with Helen ? Yeah please . Yep , sure , that's cool , um <disfmarker> Yeah we have to take that <gap> out . Oh , so we do yeah . Yeah . Sorry . Fun and games . <vocalsound> Sorry . Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . Uh sorry , I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . I have <gap> . <vocalsound> Brian , this one also I <gap> . Yeah . Okay . I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . Thank you very much Brian . If you want me to help , yeah . Um , yep . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ? Uh F_ eight . Function F_ eight . Function F_ eight . Oh right . Mm s . Okay , cool . It's not coming . Oh . Function F_ eight , okay . Yeah . Yeah . No signal . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Computer . There you go . Computer adjusting , yeah . Okay . Cool . Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh F_ five . F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . Escape . Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also <disfmarker> I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , <vocalsound> so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? Uh just a left uh The arrow ? Okay . left mouse button . So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . Um and what people <disfmarker> fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think . Mm-hmm . Okay . So um what they like and what they find fashionable . 'Kay . <vocalsound> And ergonomics , we said um , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but um maybe that comes up , I don't know . That can come under Arlo as well . And the findings , well the basic <disfmarker> that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . That's what people want to do . Uh . Um , so they need to be included , um , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . I don't know how to get to them , <vocalsound> do I press F_ five is it ? <gap> escape ? Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . Oh okay , cool . I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . <vocalsound> Uh okay . These are two leading um remote controls at the moment . You know they're grey , 'Kay . they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , <gap> <vocalsound> and they don't look very exciting at all . Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , Mm-hmm . um , but there you go , that's what we're up against , and I think we can do much better than that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We hope so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Of course . <vocalsound> Um hang on . F_ five , okay , sorry . <vocalsound> Personal preferences . Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um <gap> Yeah , particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . Uh-huh . Yeah . And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more um <vocalsound> not as uh computery and Organic <vocalsound> . or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think . <vocalsound> Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent <disfmarker> fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , <gap> Mm-hmm . so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks . Sales , <gap> . Okay . Um , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um <disfmarker> Yeah it's like a , yeah . <vocalsound> It's <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , Right . so maybe we forget about that . And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time . Yeah . It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark Mm-hmm . Exactly . Yeah . um which <vocalsound> does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . Yeah . Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , Okay . or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . Yeah . And I think that , yep , that's it . That's cool . So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , Okay ? Mm-hmm . and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? Um , or if <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> is that a function we want in the remote ? Um , I haven't been able to <disfmarker> Um , do you have trouble whistling ? I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right . <vocalsound> Really ? Ooh . <vocalsound> Yeah it just <disfmarker> I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? Mm-hmm , yeah Yeah , I suppose that's true . or some sort of voice <disfmarker> Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> That's costly though . Yeah . Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , Mm-hmm . Hmm . Yeah . Sounds good . uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ? Yeah , something . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Well , uh let me set this up . So I plug it in , press F_ five ? Function F_ five ? Function F_ eight for the um the uh <disfmarker> Or function F_ eight ? Okay . Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . Okay . I think it's <vocalsound> uh just to lock it in . Yeah . It's got it . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , <vocalsound> Alright . um so it's good you went first , <vocalsound> and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . Let's remember that . Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and uh <vocalsound> he mentioned that they're not fun to use . And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , <gap> there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . Mm-hmm . But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . Mm-hmm . Oh yeah , yeah , that's true . Mm-hmm . Well maybe you could have a um hmm <vocalsound> tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . Um . Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . <vocalsound> Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um <vocalsound> and not computery , <vocalsound> right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss . <vocalsound> Right um , and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window . <vocalsound> And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , <vocalsound> which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains <disfmarker> Ah is that what that is ? <vocalsound> Or uh or a high speed train . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . <vocalsound> Well that's cool . If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . Right . So , Yeah sure . I figured , just put 'em all together . <vocalsound> You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm . as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and and it's a <disfmarker> you know , for the the cowboy in all of us <gap> <disfmarker> I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but <disfmarker> Right okay . <vocalsound> Well I like that design . <vocalsound> Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a <disfmarker> Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? Right . Yeah . <vocalsound> So I think I I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? Yeah , Right . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> not a problem . Fifty million was uh prof Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g <vocalsound> <vocalsound> As a profit . Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers . gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . <vocalsound> Okay . Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . Mm-hmm . An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <vocalsound> Okay . um , we don't wanna have it <disfmarker> Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? Uh . Or a little base station or something , <gap> . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . Um , I hadn't thought of that . Yeah . <vocalsound> That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's <disfmarker> that's cheaper to just provide batteries . Yeah , yeah . Right . I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , A battery in it , kinda . so I don't think it'd up up the price that much . Right , Okay . so so <vocalsound> the unirs the user interface <vocalsound> Okay . uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> behind our product . <vocalsound> Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . Okay . <vocalsound> Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um <vocalsound> you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . <vocalsound> And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so <disfmarker> uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . Mm . Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options . Yeah , me too . Oh okay . And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . Right . Mm 'kay . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's all I got . 'Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ooh that's tight . Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is <disfmarker> let's see , I'll find it myself , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ta Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . nah . <vocalsound> Just push it . Yeah . We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . Mm-hmm . Um , <vocalsound> dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . Um it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , Okay . and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . Corporate colour . Yellow . Okay . Yellow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I presume . Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . Mm-hmm . And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh <disfmarker> I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . Yeah . Uh , where am I ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . 'Kay . Uh , <vocalsound> now , we had as listed options we had <vocalsound> speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um we also want to limit the number of buttons Mm-hmm . so we'll pretty much take that one as read . We'll use the the basic functions for a television . Mm-hmm . No teletext . Um <vocalsound> okay hold on . Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . Not enough buttons you mean ? Yeah . Well <disfmarker> So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a <disfmarker> Mm . or it looks like we're just cutting on the um <disfmarker> On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . Mm-hmm , okay . Okay , cool . <vocalsound> Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send About cost . some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote <disfmarker> teletext option in a remote control . Okay . <gap> <vocalsound> Okay um <gap> . So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the <disfmarker> a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . Yeah yeah . Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um <vocalsound> said people didn't like . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Although I guess if there's a sort of <disfmarker> If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , Mm-hmm . I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far Yeah . but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have um <vocalsound> it goes to a different selection of buttons , Yeah . so it sorta keeps it simple . Okay . Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? Um <disfmarker> Uh . Glow in the dark material I was thinking . Okay . So <disfmarker> Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . I <disfmarker> Uh may I say something about <gap> ? Yeah . Yeah . Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . But <disfmarker> Often lost s was that , Lost , yeah . yeah are lost yeah . and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . Mm-hmm . But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , Mm-hmm . like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , That's cool . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . That's cool . and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , so we should take it into consideration also . Okay , cool . Um Well hmm . speech recognition I take it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh it's <disfmarker> I don't , I've <disfmarker> I know of no products um that use speech recognition well . They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a <disfmarker> some basic speech recognition on it . You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . Really ? Yeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . Mm . Mm-hmm . They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one <gap> . Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . <gap> Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm . 'Kay . but if you can work around that that noise problem <disfmarker> Uh-huh . Well what about <disfmarker> <vocalsound> this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or <vocalsound> something Ah , that's a good idea . <gap> um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . Right . So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . <vocalsound> If you find if y Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . Yeah . What you could do then would be you have uh <vocalsound> a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s . Mm . Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah . But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker That we should just stick on , yeah . That comes with our remote control . which <disfmarker> Right , Yeah . and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television . Yeah . And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . Right , right . Mm-hmm . Right , right . Um . <vocalsound> Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . Uh-huh . And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It might do us out of a job . Yeah , okay . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . Um so I think rather than <disfmarker> and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , Mm . Hmm . And the expense . so I th yeah and expense and the time . Mm-hmm . So I think if we're going to go <disfmarker> well I mean like the thing about the <disfmarker> there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . Mm . Um , but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . Um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh <vocalsound> and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? Is that <disfmarker> Um . Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . Mm . Contrast contra well . Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , Mm-hmm . and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more . Yeah , okay . So if it's dow it's d uh yeah . Or if it's down under the couch cushions Right . um which is where I usually find mine . Mm-hmm . Right . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay , well we can use <disfmarker> we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , Yeah , 'cause what I thought , main <disfmarker> um if we're gonna have to <disfmarker> if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um slogan . Slogan , yeah . Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . Right . Mm-hmm . 'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um <vocalsound> uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . That was more of a a gimmick . Do you think ? Mm . Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . Yeah , unnecessary . Yeah . Okay . Um , okay so scratch that . Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the <disfmarker> is that far too expensive ? <vocalsound> Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Well , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , Mm . there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged . Mm-hmm . They're pretty fragile . So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? Okay . Um no , I mean <gap> that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . Um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . Um . <gap> So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um <disfmarker> Yeah mm . <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> you were finding out about teletext . If you could find out that uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she <disfmarker> they wi Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a Oh . um expensive , Yeah you think so ? no ? Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . Oh right , okay . Is it not the circuits that cost <disfmarker> And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , like a <disfmarker> Oh right , okay . <gap> Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ <vocalsound> the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> Five minutes . Okay . Decisions . Uh , votes , let's vote . Who wants T_F_T_ ? No-one does . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? Yeah . Mm-hmm , that's cool . Okay . Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . Um And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . Glow in dark . Uh <disfmarker> if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . <vocalsound> Uh o okay . Yeah . <gap> And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay , so . Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . So , it just helps me summarize them . Yeah yeah . Here ? Sure . <vocalsound> And um I'll put any <disfmarker> <gap> I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh <disfmarker> And where is it sorry ? Uh pro uh project documents . On <vocalsound> So it should be when you save A_M_I_ scenario controller . on your desktop , so it goes save as , or <disfmarker> Oh <gap> . Uh it is in shared documents ? And then uh hit that little folder up thing again . Where am I ? Projoct uh projector . Project documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well . Again . All the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . Right and then project documents . Okay , cool . Hmm . It is not giving anything . <vocalsound> Shared documents . And I will tr <gap> getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than <disfmarker> <gap> I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Mm . Did you get my email ? I did <gap> . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Just making sure . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , So <disfmarker> it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . Um , a bit more <vocalsound> durable and that can also be ergonomic Okay . and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . <vocalsound> Yeah . The rubber rather than <disfmarker> Yeah . More sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Wow . Um but we have to take care like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But we have to take care of our children also if they <disfmarker> <vocalsound> means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . So , whatever material we use it should be <disfmarker> yeah . Oh no , ethics , <vocalsound> that's gonna cost us money . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . <vocalsound> Okay , safety . <gap> Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as <disfmarker> it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um <disfmarker> Yeah . I dunno , I mean <disfmarker> It sme <vocalsound> We could go comp yeah . smells good for children . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And it's got the thing on the inside . And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . <vocalsound> That's a good idea . <vocalsound> That sounds , And then ch children will love it . <vocalsound> yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . <vocalsound> Interesting . Oh yellow , yellow ball . Right . Yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? Please God no . Um . Well , I wouldn't th I mean , No . my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so Yeah . I think just having it Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow <gap> with the logo in it . Having a little bit . surrounding the logo . Okay cool . Mm mm . Yeah . Mm-hmm , okay . Cool . And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the <disfmarker> what was it ? We put <vocalsound> we put fashion into <disfmarker> Whoops , it's not working . Can't believe I've forgotten it <gap> . We put the fashion in electronics Oh yeah , that's a good one that . . <vocalsound> I bet that'll catch on well . Yeah so . <vocalsound> Okay , any last Yeah . worries , queries ? <vocalsound> Twelve thirty . Okay . <vocalsound> S s <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm . I know what you're thinking . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay then , lunchtime , yay . That's good . Okay , that felt a bit more like a <disfmarker> something with order and and reason to it than the last one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is quite fun actually . Wow . Mm . Has anybo oh . I really don't <disfmarker> Has anybody pressed okay , it vibrates . It's pretty cool . Yeah , yeah . Yep . Check here . Wow you've <gap> your first page . I was just writing really big . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , got small writing . <vocalsound> Yeah I've been using up the pages . I don't wanna waste it . I've finished the meeting now . <vocalsound> Another questionnaire . Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire . <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . Hmm . Is that someone's ? Is that <gap> . Thank you . <gap> three , apparently . Hmm . Hmm . Okay , you all switched on . Okay . Yep , me too . I presume we're good to go . Okay , um minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger , Mm-hmm . standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um <vocalsound> and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um <vocalsound> and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ? Prototype presentation . Is that <gap> for us ? I think that would be you . Yep . Okay . Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . Yeah , shall I show ? Yeah . I'll show . Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it Make sure the camera's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I can hold it like <disfmarker> and I'll I'll show you the presentation . Yeah , so <disfmarker> Can I just nick your <disfmarker> Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out . <gap> Whoa . It looks Um <disfmarker> Going a bit crazy over here . crazy <gap> . Okay . Thank you . <vocalsound> You should have one of those things Um not now . Oh . and you can just take it off . Yeah . Ta-da . Oh , where are the hinges ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so this is our look and feel presentation , the final <disfmarker> our final presentation . Right . Mm 'kay . And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um 'Kay . It's gonna have a a plastic body <vocalsound> um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . You able to look <gap> ? Yep . <gap> This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing Mm-hmm . um which there'd be sort of a wide choice <disfmarker> they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . Okay . Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um <vocalsound> it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design <vocalsound> and uh <vocalsound> the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um <vocalsound> how do you say , it's <disfmarker> yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top <vocalsound> <gap> . The black and white touch screen wherein people can <disfmarker> Mm . So it's flush . and the buttons at the bottom would d Right . so so it'll fully close flat . Oh right , okay , yeah . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> And working on the inside <gap> <gap> we've um already said <disfmarker> d decided on the kinetic batteries , which <disfmarker> actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of <disfmarker> So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , Yeah . Yeah . 'cause it's the top part that's <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . okay . Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in <vocalsound> and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . <vocalsound> Or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then <disfmarker> yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . <vocalsound> Okay . 'Kay . I'm under the sofa . Ah oka Or , that would be too complicated . Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's <disfmarker> be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . Infrared <gap> . Um it would it would have <disfmarker> obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . <vocalsound> And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared um sender would be on the <disfmarker> on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the <disfmarker> we haven't <disfmarker> I don't think we actually put it on . Like here . Yeah , yeah , something like that . Okay . Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here . Actually , no , it would be <disfmarker> it would have to be on the on the front . Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah . <gap> . So when it's <disfmarker> even if it's open here , the signals would go <gap> . Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you . It's still pointing , So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . yes . Yeah . Yeah , that would make sense . And then finally um on to the interface . <vocalsound> The top screen , as we said , is <disfmarker> would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen <gap> which <disfmarker> yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , This one right here . uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . <gap> . Okay . And now we've <disfmarker> we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . Which is <disfmarker> But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . No . once it's <disfmarker> Look up to it . Okay . And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is <disfmarker> that's the company logo <gap> . Thank you very much . Yay . Wrapping it all up , Well done . okay . Um I've now got evaluation criteria . Certainly . So this is the one . Sorry . It's to be presented <gap> . There you go . <gap> . Logged in ? Thank you . Oops . Okay . Evaluation . <gap> . <vocalsound> Mm um I I think this is <gap> chip . It's quite similar to what it was before , though . Okay . Sorry . This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . <vocalsound> So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those <disfmarker> the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . <vocalsound> Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ? <vocalsound> Ah , it's perfect . So we're going to look at these crite Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market <disfmarker> Yes , <gap> okay . we're going to come to <disfmarker> w we'll discuss each one Mm-hmm . and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . Okay . Is that okay ? 'Kay . One is true , seven is false . Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . <vocalsound> This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Just write small . <vocalsound> Criteria and rating . Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ? Yeah . That works . Yeah , Yeah , okay . so you can <disfmarker> Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy <disfmarker> it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two . One is true and seven is false . <vocalsound> I would agree . Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh <vocalsound> two <disfmarker> yeah , I'll just go this way . Okay . 'Kay . two or three . Two . No , three . Three . Okay . I would say two . Two . <vocalsound> I would say four . A four , okay . Mm-hmm . Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right . Mm yeah . Almost three . Two and three quarters ? I think yeah . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . <vocalsound> Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . I would give that a three . I'd give it a one . Okay . Not that you're biased <vocalsound> in that it <disfmarker> the designer . No , no , not at all . A two . Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ? The first . The average <disfmarker> oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ? Yeah , I I just <gap> it the other way . Uh in <gap> Yep , I just got <disfmarker> Okay . So , <gap> I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered <disfmarker> Okay , and we're just waiting for your rating two point f It's just two point five for that one . f Two point five , okay . Yeah . Losing one decimal place , that's okay . One is a <gap> , seven is false , okay . So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? Two . Two , okay . So that is eight . That brings it down to two , nice and simple , Two . yeah . Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ? Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . Two . Two . I would say a two . I would say a two . A two , okay . Two . Two . I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We'll just put almost two , because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . One point seven f five . Yeah . Okay , mm-hmm . Okay . Or we <disfmarker> or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at D_ . it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . One . Yeah . Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . Yeah , Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? that's <disfmarker> No , no , the the base colour was um <vocalsound> white or or like or l sort of a light blue , White . With <disfmarker> for the plastic ? Uh blue . but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any <disfmarker> basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised . Right . Any <disfmarker> So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . Right . Yeah , yeah , yeah Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Okay . And the spongy feel is no problem with that . and <disfmarker> No , no , Yeah , because you'll be having a <disfmarker> Because of the rubber case . 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that <disfmarker> otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . Okay . In that case it's got to be a one for me . Yeah , I'll give it a one as well . Yep . Everybody ? One . Okay . One . <vocalsound> That part was nice and easy . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . Mm . No . We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? Yeah . Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ It's meant to be . Mm-hmm . it's meant to . Um Mm-hmm . <gap> maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , <gap> but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . Mm . So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . Mm-hmm . Right . It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um <disfmarker> Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . Yeah . Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , A five , okay . 'cause <disfmarker> Four . Four and a four okay . Four . Twenty one <disfmarker> is that twenty one ? So that's four point two five . <gap> Yep . And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really <disfmarker> have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? Yeah . Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , Voice r recognition . It was the I'm here thing , yep . yeah . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . Yeah , yeah , that <disfmarker> yeah , that's feasible . That sounds good then . I'd go for a <disfmarker> I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . Um I think it would r I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand A standard . it would be quite loud . It would be . Right . Okay . So it would be s p You built into the feature . And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . yeah . Okay . Logical . That's a one for me . <vocalsound> Yeah , one . One One . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and one , good . <vocalsound> I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , <vocalsound> So , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> how do we feel about this ? We've got our our <disfmarker> we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . <gap> <gap> The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . <vocalsound> Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? I don't think so . W I thin yeah , We happy to go ahead ? I think <disfmarker> I think we <disfmarker> yeah . I think we're set . yeah . Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . Do much apart from having a huge big <disfmarker> Mm . I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I sum up ? Don't think so . No . Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there . <vocalsound> Okay , Oops . thank you . <vocalsound> Okay , Hmm . I've got finance here now . I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's okay . Um . Oh yes . You want me to b unplug that ? <gap> <gap> That's all . Yes . Thanks . Right . Okay . Now I presume that the screen will go blank , <vocalsound> that um <disfmarker> Okay . We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . So are we still on for kinetic ? Yeah . Yes . Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice . Right , what's happening with the electronics ? It was a regular chip on print Chip on print . and <disfmarker> Double-curved . Oh , no , no , no , the um <disfmarker> Yeah , it's <disfmarker> you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . In the top , it's the number of c yeah <gap> . Oh , right , okay . Thanks . Yeah , and <disfmarker> So , would there be two ? yeah , just a <disfmarker> no , one reg v uh <disfmarker> One chip . Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . Okay . Okay . Yep . And they're double curved . No . Y Single-curved . One double curve . Two , 'cause it's two . Two curves , yeah . But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . So what's a single curve then ? Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . <gap> like a domed thing . yeah , I think I think it's <disfmarker> So Single-cu just one double <disfmarker> Mm . One double-curved . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> <gap> . And one <disfmarker> no , Plastic and rubber . 'cause one <disfmarker> yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> Um we've got plastic and rubber , a plastic . haven't we ? Yeah . Yeah . Plastic one and maybe rubber point five . And special colour . <vocalsound> <gap> . No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , Um <disfmarker> we can put point five . Yeah . Do you think ? Yeah , I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that . Yeah . Okay . What does it mean if you put point five for that ? It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . It would be like saying we're using <disfmarker> See , it says case material . Mm-hmm . So we're not actually using plastic in the case , No , no , are we ? that's <disfmarker> it's as an extra . It's including , it's including . Right , okay . So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . <gap> So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . Okay . Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . Yeah , okay . Mm . No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ? Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . N yeah , okay . <vocalsound> Interface . Push-button . Yeah , the push-button's one One . and L_C_ display one . An One . And buttons <disfmarker> Buttons <disfmarker> S <vocalsound> I think we could change the battery also . Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? Well Is it <disfmarker> Has that not gone up ? oh , yes . it's brought it slightly down . Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot . So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ? Yeah . Uncurved , flat . <vocalsound> Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? . No , It's gone up again . No , we'll have <disfmarker> it just surprises one . Oh , it's not calculated it . No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again . Oh . Okay , there we go . <vocalsound> It's brought it down slightly . <vocalsound> It's not a lot though . C it might uh <gap> . <vocalsound> I don't think so . you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . Is there anything on the menu <disfmarker> We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , No . I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No . Ri I think it's in Euro <gap> . Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here . Um <vocalsound> and the interface . If we tr um . If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? And going to a regular bat Yeah , the standard , Yeah . it <vocalsound> um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away <disfmarker> if you took away <disfmarker> What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery <gap> . If you to It's internal , nobody looks into the battery . Yeah . But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi And people are used to buying batteries , If if you take away the voice , they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . Where's that special form ? Mm mm mm . Should we see what difference it makes ? Where's the Yeah i yeah . No where's the voice recognition ? 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . Um <disfmarker> Right , okay . If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's <disfmarker> that's minus three . They <vocalsound> n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two . Oh , right . I keep seeing zero . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We can do it some other way , <gap> we can do <disfmarker> it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . Yeah . Yeah . Sure . Mm-hmm . You could choose to have that or not . But they <disfmarker> but I mean in <disfmarker> I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . But we're still working to um head o So should we just change the design specification then ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Make it costly . We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as <disfmarker> this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we <disfmarker> the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . Yes . Yeah . Mm-hmm . We c we could s But we need to work to that specification to start with . Yeah , Mm-hmm . And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , we could say <disfmarker> but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers Okay , we can make the price fit , Yeah , I s and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , And then say we recommend <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . Yeah . because it also sets it apart from the crowd . 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . Yeah . It's <vocalsound> s something completely different associated with your company . Yeah . Right , okay , so <disfmarker> So if we take voice recognition out <disfmarker> That'll do it . Twelve point three five . Yeah <gap> we are . we are close to the budget . Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? Two five . It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five . Are you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there . Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , Right . <vocalsound> Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ? isn't it ? It's twelve point five maybe , then . Which is less than ten P_ . I don't know what <disfmarker> it said fifty percent of the cost . <vocalsound> I think the agenda one was where the um price was , So half of the price would be <disfmarker> wasn't it ? No . I think it is the first one . That's today's kick off meeting , <gap> . Twelve point five . Mm . <gap> I thought that's what it was . Ah . <gap> So we are under the budget . Well done , people . So we're okay . Okay . So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ? Yeah . No . Okay . 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Seems fine . Yeah , I think that's brilliant . Except voice recognition , everything is <disfmarker> Right , so we've done that . Okay . Product evaluation . We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? Yeah . Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't <disfmarker> didn't feel able to make . Um Yeah . I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . Mm-hmm . Yes . <vocalsound> Yeah . um in the sense that um did you feel like a team ? Or did you feel like <vocalsound> uh autonomy ? Yeah , I'd say , as a team . Although we had our separate tasks , I think we had a nice time . there was so much interaction , Yeah . so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . Find out from each other , yeah . And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . It's not like people trying to cut each other . There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . We came to a very predic creative design , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I think . And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . Thank you . How did you find it ? Yeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually <disfmarker> if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , but <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah . I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , Yeah . Yeah . you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . Mm . I like that . Um Yeah . teamwork . Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , well . I think that was the best part Um <vocalsound> uh I'm still not caught up . of the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s . Maybe . 'Kay . No , that was quite fun . Um <vocalsound> means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ? <gap> Discuss which ones <disfmarker> <gap> How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? yeah . Yeah . Could it've been better , was it adequate ? Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had had more time and if we'd been separated more . Had time to kind of <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , Yeah . Yeah . yeah . Yeah . Yeah . But it was nice having it there . Um like the whole picture of the thing . Yeah , <gap> moving around the room . Yeah . <vocalsound> But I think it's good , like uh we spent times individually . I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . <vocalsound> Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general , It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , rather than <disfmarker> Yeah . it so it's <disfmarker> I mean nothing is new , Mm . but it's applying it to a d in a different area . Vegetables . <vocalsound> That's mine . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , no . Well Yeah , it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they have to come from somewhere , don't they ? Absolutely , yeah . The thing is <disfmarker> And as sh as w sorry , you go . Yep , sorry , go on Sarah . Um as was shown by <vocalsound> your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . No . Mm-hmm . I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , Mm-hmm . but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . <vocalsound> Yeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , Yeah . just jazz it up a bit . Mm . Uh d they don't really think about it , Yeah . because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ . Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah . But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , Yeah . Yeah . I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , No . <vocalsound> Yeah . I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , Yeah . you would pray <disfmarker> you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being <disfmarker> a plastic was being made for you . Yeah . But people could <gap> have anything that they wanted . Mm . Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . Because of the produ Mm . Yeah . And new f television products coming up , but nobody giving uh much idea to this . I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , Like Sarah was telling , everything's <disfmarker> Right . because <vocalsound> just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want . Yes . Yeah . <vocalsound> I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore Yeah . and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . Well , it's innovation for money's sake . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . The the people have to keep buying . But forcing it onto people , Yeah . yeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want . And you can't get <disfmarker> you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , Mm . Mm . because the phones have moved on , things like that . Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , Yes . yeah . It's madness . Um <disfmarker> See I think <disfmarker> In closing <disfmarker> There we go . <gap> <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> our costs are below budget with recommendations that they <disfmarker> the budget be increased , but I think <disfmarker> I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well . I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone . I think that was just the the physical . So it looks <disfmarker> well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . Yeah . Maybe fifty percent more . Yeah , I think <disfmarker> But I think <disfmarker> but you were saying that that's quite <disfmarker> yeah But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I don't <disfmarker> from the market research . I think we've done what we were required to do , Hmm . and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . Yeah . No . Yeah , it was <disfmarker> I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item Mm . Yeah . that I think people are really gonna want . Yeah . It's a shame it won't ever get made . <vocalsound> I know . <vocalsound> Maybe it will . Maybe it will . Who knows ? Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is . and sell it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . There's a final questionnaire . Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with <vocalsound> <vocalsound> everything that I fell behind with , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In your <disfmarker> so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor , yeah . <vocalsound> so good luck . Celebration , you didn't talk about that . I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Questionnaire . Okay . Is that it then ? Um yeah , just the last , I think . Awesome . <vocalsound> I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy . Questionnaire done . Oh , I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . Was that not the questionnaire for the <disfmarker> how you felt you'd done in your thing ? Oh , right . But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? I don't think . Yeah , the the s Yeah . yeah . I think <disfmarker> yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting . Yeah . Mm . I just got con
Okay . Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . Yep . Yep . Alright . Okay , so first let's go through this PowerPoint . I wonder what button I press ? Just do it on the <gap> arrow . <gap> Yeah , or how about I just click ? Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . <vocalsound> We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . Okay , here is our project . We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um <disfmarker> We're gonna have <disfmarker> discuss the functional design first , <vocalsound> how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . We could <disfmarker> Yeah , we could on here . Alright , let's go forward then . <vocalsound> Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . Even if you are not a good drawer like me . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright . Artistic skills , nil . Fine . Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , thanks . <vocalsound> Bless you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I draw like I'm in grade five . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh do I . <vocalsound> 'Kay , about one more minute . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . And who would like to start us off ? I'll go . Alright . <vocalsound> Um this is my picture . I drew fish <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . <vocalsound> It's pretty cool , and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . <vocalsound> Only if they're piranhas . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , they they're easy , you know . Yeah . Alright . Who wants to go next ? <vocalsound> I'll go . I drew a kitty . It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats . No I I see it . No , I kne I knew . No , it looks like a cat . Yeah , it does look like a cat . I love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on . <vocalsound> I love cats , too . Yeah . I'm a cat person . I'm allergic to cats . Ah . Uh . I'm allergic to cats , too . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , okay . <vocalsound> If you're around one <disfmarker> In my next life . I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , Yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time <disfmarker> it's weird . I still can't sleep with them in my room . Okay . <vocalsound> Oh , yeah , this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . It was crazy . Yeah . Okay , Fenella ? Um , I drew a badger . <vocalsound> Cool . <vocalsound> Yay . Badger . Good choice . <vocalsound> Well , yeah . Why a badger ? <vocalsound> Uh I dunno , they're grumpy and nocturnal and <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are you trying to suggest something ? <vocalsound> Well , a little bit like the <disfmarker> Yes . Um . <vocalsound> And then , if you know Wind in the Willows <gap> badger . Oh , okay . Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian <gap> . He's Liverpudlian writer . Alright . Um <gap> , that kind of books . Badgers are cool in that one too . <vocalsound> Okay . And I'm last . 'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe . No , that's good . No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . They're just such odd creatures , you know . I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . Only seen a couple in zoos . You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em <disfmarker> Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . Okay . Alright . Guess we're getting straight back into business here . <gap> Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . Okay . So we're gonna talk for a little while . Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . So . Now ? Yeah . You wanna start us off ? Anybody have anything to offer ? <vocalsound> Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ? Right . One remote for everything . And everything being <disfmarker> Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ? Right . Um . I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly . Yeah , TiVo . TiVo . But it's still there , so Okay . if po if we're gonna do it <disfmarker> It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . They're never universal . That's right . Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the <disfmarker> Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a <disfmarker> I don't know . Yeah . Yeah . Something from Sam's club . So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . Yeah . And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . Yeah . 'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't <disfmarker> Nobody wants to buy those any more . They want the ergonomic ones . They want like the flashy lights . Yeah . Oh like this came from Las Vegas . Ones that ones that look high-tech , too . But at the same time are simple . Mm yeah . Right . So that people like my mother can use it . What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? Yeah . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that <disfmarker> Just bad ones . <vocalsound> Yeah <gap> . <vocalsound> That's true . Um . What kinda battery would we want to use ? Because battery changing is usually <disfmarker> D Double A_ . Double A_ . Okay . Do some of them use triple A_s though ? Yeah some use triple A_s . Some but <disfmarker> So double or triple ? Okay . Yeah , I guess then it's <disfmarker> If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around . Okay . Yeah . But that has to do with the size of it too . Right . Yeah . Well , w as long as we know that issue is <disfmarker> Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ . Here we can <disfmarker> Triple A . Can you <gap> with a small lithium battery ? But it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . <vocalsound> Hey . Anything else ? Alright . Moving along . Oh , we're closing the meeting . Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . Here's what we're going to do . Um the I_D_ , which is who ? Okay , you're going to think about the working design . What do you think that means ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , Mm-hmm . making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . Okay . And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . Right ? Right . I would think so . Okay . And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? Okay . This meeting is officially over .
<vocalsound> Okay . Mm-hmm . So we are here for the concept design meeting . So , we will first start by summarizing the mm <vocalsound> the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest <disfmarker> next task , to have <disfmarker> to be done before the next meeting . So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . We also decided to have a wheel to change channel <disfmarker> previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by <disfmarker> or U_I_ <vocalsound> Abdul al-Hasred is my name . okay . <vocalsound> And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . So this is the presentation . Uh , I_D_ you want ? Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request . Yeah . I only v have three slides , so . I just look at the mm <disfmarker> um just this . On some web pages to find some documentation Yeah . and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . And um <vocalsound> yeah we can change directly . Yeah . In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . Okay . Mm-hmm . And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not <disfmarker> if if we could combine something with the push button . Okay . Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . Yeah . But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? Mm . Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . Yeah . Yeah I I th <vocalsound> So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ? But I don't think that uh we should <disfmarker> We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . Yeah . Okay Also have to say <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? Um that's all <vocalsound> No ? yeah . You received something <disfmarker> I haven't chec Yeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . Hmm . Says <disfmarker> Yeah . It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . But I guess it could be <disfmarker> And could it be adapted ? I guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip Okay . Yeah . then we we could use it . Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on <disfmarker> according to those news . Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah but I think it's yeah <disfmarker> Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . Um <vocalsound> the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , Okay . and if we could reduce that . We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . Mm-hmm . I have a question about that actually <vocalsound> . Um , what is the purpose of the light ? Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber <disfmarker> Is <disfmarker> You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? But <disfmarker> But in th in the dark uh <disfmarker> Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ? But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . Hmm . You can see the buttons better , of course . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . True . Yeah . Actually . But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to <disfmarker> when you move it to detect your movement . As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ? Yeah . Again . Yeah <vocalsound> no it's too expensive . <vocalsound> I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be <disfmarker> Okay . Mm . Extra . Yeah , okay . Mm . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , <vocalsound> First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light yeah . and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device <disfmarker> Mm . Mm-hmm . But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ? Yeah , a little bit . A little bit . Mm . Well we will discuss that after maybe Yeah . Okay the other presentations . . So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . Yeah . So . It was last time I saw it . And it is . Okay . So , Okay . <vocalsound> just move to the next slide . <vocalsound> So basically <vocalsound> want very simple , right ? That's the major idea , as simple as possible . Yeah . Yeah . So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . Yeah . Um . <vocalsound> So . And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . Yeah <vocalsound> . Yeah . Yeah . So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , Yeah . Yeah . and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? Yeah . These are the basic thing . So it's only the central part . So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . Yeah , if you have , for example <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . It could be on the right side , for example . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because Okay . you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . Okay . S Okay . So that they're separate a bit , Will be down or <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . Uh and it's easy to press the other <disfmarker> the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . Okay . Alright , you won't <disfmarker> yeah . Usually what <disfmarker> I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . Okay . Yeah . That you want to protect a bit . And I think it's uh it's reasonable . Okay . So , I don't think <disfmarker> Yeah , this is just the the wheel . We could use the <disfmarker> Mm . some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . Mm-hmm . Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . Yeah . Maybe the wheel will be a <vocalsound> good advantage over our competitors . Mm-hmm . Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect . To s Mm-hmm . Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . Okay . So we can move to the <disfmarker> Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? <vocalsound> or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay . Okay , I can go ? Can I ? Yeah . <vocalsound> So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative . <vocalsound> And the third most important aspect is to to <disfmarker> is that the co remote control should be easy to use . Okay . So , are things we are we have uh speak about before . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . And um <disfmarker> so you you can go <disfmarker> Yeah . after . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . <vocalsound> So , maybe if our <vocalsound> remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form <vocalsound> something like that , or <disfmarker> Okay . I support an apple . <vocalsound> And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . <vocalsound> Uh I don't know which material <vocalsound> can be spongy , Yeah . and if you <disfmarker> This is good also for <disfmarker> Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , it it would work , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . You can throw it to the television . Yeah , because it's robust . Okay <vocalsound> Yeah . Me too . It's robust , yeah . Hey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> When it d uh takes a shock . <vocalsound> Not good . Yeah uh sorry ? Ah it's okay . I know that they do that for alarm clock also . An and and uh this uh you can Yeah . yeah you can say that . You ca uh you can go uh before No . Yeah . Before ? , before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . Yeah . Yeah that's why <disfmarker> Yeah Has it ? that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . Yeah . I think it's <disfmarker> it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . Mm-hmm . Innovative . Mm . So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . How do we make it look cool is the question . Cool , fancy ? Yeah . We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Maybe uh um <vocalsound> a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . What about um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Oh , colour , yeah . Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . Oh <disfmarker> i i <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe yeah . <vocalsound> I thought about a a pear , for example . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well . and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . A pear . The banana is also ergonomic . <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that . Or a fruit like that . I dunno . Yeah . We can discuss that uh . D D Is is there anything you want to add ? Is there any fruit that is spongy ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , Something like that . with blue L_E_D_ inside ? But that's not in the trend . <vocalsound> . You can make it um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's not hard , the metal . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . Plastic . <vocalsound> Yep . So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , Yeah . and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . Odi Banana I think , it's a nice idea . Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . Because <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , Two of the button , yeah . but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , Yeah . Yeah . and here you have a a push button to <disfmarker> But you don't have <disfmarker> I think it's a good idea , yeah . Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . Yeah . So you can have it on on two sides Yeah . and it'll be cool , no ? Yeah . I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find . You can put also vibrator inside . And everybody knows what is a banana . <vocalsound> Yeah . Basically . If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . <vocalsound> Oh , yeah <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah it's really uh really a good point . <vocalsound> I hope the students of management die , <vocalsound> but anyway . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now who are recording this meeting ? I think it <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> One second . So we have to take some decision on this aspect . So , uh so for <disfmarker> <vocalsound> sorry , for uh component , so <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> we have to think about those aspects , sorry . So we will just use a a standard battery ? Yeah . And uh the chip we <disfmarker> chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ? I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . Yeah . Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . <vocalsound> I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . The only th Yeah . Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . Yeah yeah . Yeah . But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be <disfmarker> I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to <disfmarker> Spongy also . I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot . So if we try to push the buttons , it <disfmarker> Oh no I think it's possible . But <disfmarker> You think it's possible ? No the button would be <disfmarker> In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . This is uh like the <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay odd shape with spongy <disfmarker> cover . And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . So we agree to put the wheel <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Wheel on the top . Button , where do we want some buttons ? Well , usually hold <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ? Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So it have to <disfmarker> it has to be symmetrical . Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o <vocalsound> It has to be <disfmarker> basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . Yep . Yep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Basically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm . Should have the two sides . Mm-hmm . So if <gap> the left , we have <disfmarker> the op I think you can turn it this way also . You can do both with both hands . Wheel <disfmarker> Wheel buttons . Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . I think it's okay . So you cannot see them . Well , you you will get used to it . Yeah . And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be <disfmarker> Y Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . Yeah . No you you <disfmarker> I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well . I think this doesn't change that much . Okay . Yeah ? Okay . Maybe . Yeah . So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . And <disfmarker> and uh a wheel on the top . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So the colour is yellow . I think it's uh <disfmarker> we defined everything according to what we should <disfmarker> what the decision we should take , yeah . So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc <disfmarker> the product . That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> so <disfmarker> to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . That would uh <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> be better , I think . And uh <disfmarker> And so uh <vocalsound> you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . Mm-hmm . So <vocalsound> Yes master . do you need to add anything ? No . <vocalsound> You feel okay ? Yeah . You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? Yeah . You don't feel too constrained ? <vocalsound> You don't feel free to answer this ? No . <vocalsound> Maybe you can make <gap> uh <vocalsound> uh mm <vocalsound> Okay , so <disfmarker> okay . Thank you . See you .
<vocalsound> I just forgot their name , so uh you're i sorry , I just forgot them all . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I have to write it down . <vocalsound> Okay . So <disfmarker> Fine . Do you know them or <disfmarker> The names ? Yeah . For for for my sur um Yeah . Jens . Yeah , no , but your b your surname . Uh Damman . D_ A_ W_ . W_O_ da . Okay . Uh uh M_ M_ . I mean M_ . Double M_ . Okay . And what's your name ? Paul Wiezer . Paul Wiezer . W_I_E_S_ z Z_ or S_ ? A_ E_ Z_ zee zee Uh uh zee <gap> . Okay . E_ R_ . What's your name ? Uh Martijn . Yeah , but your surname . <vocalsound> What ? Your surname . Uh Abbing . A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_ . Okay , thanks . I was a little short on time , Uh . Yeah , me too , but <disfmarker> so that's not <disfmarker> Yeah , same here . No no no , I just fi first my <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Sorry . Uh let's see . Which one was mine ? So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough . <gap> Okay , perfect . So we have <disfmarker> Oh no , what's that ? So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are , Good . that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like <disfmarker> look like . Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you . Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one . How do I escape this ? What ? How do I I escape this s uh presentation ? Uh left . Uh <disfmarker> Ah okay . Just <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Yeah . And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um <disfmarker> Should be a univ uh universal remote control <disfmarker> No , that's <disfmarker> I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So <vocalsound> have you changed that part ? Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Um so <disfmarker> yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um <disfmarker> All these points uh we have to look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno . Yeah , okay . Uh so <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh <disfmarker> Which one first ? Okay . Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the <disfmarker> Okay . Mm . Uh <disfmarker> Functional requirements , yeah Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site . I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me , You didn't read it ? I didn't get it uh anyway . No , I didn don't thing we got it . Oh okay , It's only for you . I I was the only one who get it . Yeah . Yes . Okay it was uh uh uh um um <vocalsound> a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . I think this fits uh at the <vocalsound> uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements . The last point is quite an interesting <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . Um Martijn alr already said it . So if we <disfmarker> Yeah . And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but <disfmarker> I don't think it's uh Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , reachable . then you're you're <disfmarker> Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . Yeah . That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you <vocalsound> clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly . Uh . Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this . It's only uh th thirty four of the <vocalsound> thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think . Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't <disfmarker> We we haven't <disfmarker> Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . Okay , last page . <vocalsound> Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that . Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical . And older people uh want to spend uh more money . <vocalsound> But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things . <gap> So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , Yeah . because <disfmarker> because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . Yeah . It's too <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Um then <disfmarker> I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's <vocalsound> not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this . Um my point is , well , I <vocalsound> <disfmarker> If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise . Because it's too expensive . Yeah , only only for television uh <disfmarker> Yeah , probably . On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it . Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a <vocalsound> a new product . We have to be um <disfmarker> Yeah . One of a kind , I think . So it has to look uh uh uh unique , Unique . <vocalsound> The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . but <disfmarker> Yeah , I reckon <disfmarker> Yeah . But old people are not looking for that . Uh I think mm <disfmarker> Not really . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . Yeah . Yeah , to k to keep it simple when you <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . But uh we also have to stand out , Yeah . Sorry I thought about it , yes . 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape , Yeah . Okay . so <disfmarker> Okay , this was uh my presentation . Thanks . Okay . I don't <disfmarker> Yeah . So Paul , you can do the next one if you want . You can ask some questions or something . Okay . Yeah well <disfmarker> Uh . It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , There it is . isn't it ? Okay . Technical functions design . Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't <disfmarker> that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used . So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or <disfmarker> Yeah , I have it on the next page . But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Okay . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control Yeah . to find out . But there is already in a one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to <gap> . Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options . Um basic on-off . And I found an uh <disfmarker> Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number . Okay . But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your <disfmarker> Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number . Or not ? No y Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , but not sure <gap> . Well It's a good idea , it's <disfmarker> It was just a thought . but <disfmarker> So I'm , I u <disfmarker> I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? Well uh Uh <gap> <disfmarker> what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six . Yeah ? So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the <disfmarker> Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel . Well if you said a favourite <disfmarker> Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and <disfmarker> Uh mayb for me it's <disfmarker> Well i If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call Never ? sh Never . No , neither do I . Oh . Oh are you ? So <disfmarker> And <disfmarker> Okay now , m maybe not . If I don't do it , maybe old people <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , maybe elderly people uh . Yeah , I dunno . Right . They don't like new features . So maybe not . Mm-hmm . Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable It's not , it's still not <disfmarker> It's not anymore n uh <disfmarker> when <disfmarker> Not anymore for T_V_ . <gap> Right , on off . <vocalsound> I dunno , miss <disfmarker> Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? Um <disfmarker> I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ . Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need . Is <disfmarker> Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ? Just the channel um uh <disfmarker> What I mean is uh <disfmarker> I don't thi Forward . Li like a web browser , Six seven eight or five . so <disfmarker> Oh , okay . Just very simple . But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . Like a web browser back button . Um I dunno . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't have <disfmarker> Uh I did <disfmarker> I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . <vocalsound> No . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I don't think you use that . Yeah , Y only when you want to go to <disfmarker> okay . Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? Yeah . Normally you can press one , zero or <disfmarker> Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh <disfmarker> A ten plus or <disfmarker> Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . Okay . To just keep it simple and standard uh features . Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh <disfmarker> Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people <disfmarker> Uh yeah mayb It gets some seconds . But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um two two st two stripes . Yeah , Oh okay . Yeah . it's it's no it's not a <disfmarker> So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . Yeah , but that's th mm <disfmarker> It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . Okay . So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . Yeah . Yeah . So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that <disfmarker> And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and <disfmarker> Yeah . But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f It's only for television now . So I I don't think so . No . No . Uh I just thought of another one . Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . Yeah . So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh <disfmarker> But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , Yeah . so you have I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . four arrows . Because you n almost never use menu button . Yeah , okay , So <disfmarker> but um <disfmarker> Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to <disfmarker> Yeah , a mute button . Yes . Maybe , not <disfmarker> Don't think so . I don't know where where you have to put it . <vocalsound> Yeah well , that's that's <disfmarker> I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right . Okay . And later we can d uh do the design . Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic <disfmarker> Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . Yeah . Does it have to be <disfmarker> Uh it has to be uh with different colours Um <disfmarker> I dunno . Different colours um <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow It's like a iMac or something . or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Just to make it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . Well why not ? Or <disfmarker> Yeah . That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion . But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it <disfmarker> Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . Oh , you just <disfmarker> I dunno what happened . Oh . <gap> Who ? Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . They they're uh designed very well . Just <disfmarker> And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . Yeah . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . Yeah . But uh well , I think that's a good example . Okay . Okay , <gap> we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it . Okay , sorry . Is it fin Well uh <disfmarker> Are you finished ? Okay . Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything . Okay . Well , the working design . The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided . Um <disfmarker> Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh <disfmarker> Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code to uh <disfmarker> And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ . However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . Mm-hmm . And that's uh another diode , I believe . Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? but <disfmarker> Yeah . I I think so . <vocalsound> Uh j Is <disfmarker> I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . Yeah , it's <disfmarker> I think it's usable . Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? Yeah , that's active . Yeah . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Or just a green one , because it's <disfmarker> If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . Yeah . Maybe uh <disfmarker> I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh <disfmarker> Yeah , when you press it . Yeah , that's right . But if you <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> I it's it's just uh the the <disfmarker> Two ? Red's l shows up like something's wrong , and green is like it's okay , you press the button . Mm . Yeah , I dunno . Maybe depends on uh <disfmarker> Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red . Yeah , I know . So <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . Okay , we make it red . So But maybe <disfmarker> I know . Well we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well . You have to <disfmarker> The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . <vocalsound> I I think uh the batteries will be uh <vocalsound> a little <disfmarker> Uh that's cool . <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Oh , <vocalsound> Empty . maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , we have a recharger in it , Oh . so <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Uh maybe . If we can still make that then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red . <vocalsound> It's just to indicate something's on . Yeah . Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low . Yeah . But it's cool if it was green . It's it's not very important , Green or red or whatever , it is cool . <vocalsound> so yeah . Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working . So mm <disfmarker> And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the <disfmarker> Otherwise it won't work . So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh <disfmarker> No . I I uh <disfmarker> The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to <disfmarker> Okay . An automatically search function for each television , or something . Yeah . That are working . Yeah , or <disfmarker> I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there . Well , Uh I kno I I use a universal uh remote control , and <gap> list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , Yeah ? so it works on your T_V_ . Okay . Oh , I have a modern one . <vocalsound> And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , <vocalsound> and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it , and then it's okay . Ah okay . So you don't have to search for your television or your code . Okay . It uh search uh the pattern for itself . Okay , yeah . Okay , so we use that . So it uh <disfmarker> We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Yes . Because you have to <disfmarker> Yep . Yeah . I just say <disfmarker> Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking <disfmarker> Uh okay . Well uh There's just a short <disfmarker> y you have this chip . Yeah . That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . Mm-hmm . But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . Yeah . And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . Changing the signal . And um <disfmarker> What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so <disfmarker> And then he saves that setting Okay . Yeah . and then um it's working . Yeah , that's the right uh option . Okay . Well uh the components . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't <disfmarker> I w I was a little short on time . Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . Yeah . Um that's connecting to all the components . <vocalsound> Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed . And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light . Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ . Yeah . Yeah , <gap> and this is a LED too . But this one is producing infrared light Yeah , okay . that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light . So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . Yeah <disfmarker> To flash up your <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button . Yeah . Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can <disfmarker> Basically if the battery is low , it won't work . Yeah . Yeah , and <disfmarker> Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button . Huh , that's a good idea . Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then . Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal . No , y Yeah . Okay . And it's <disfmarker> you also know which button you p But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs . Yeah , that's right . But it <disfmarker> Everywhere in the r But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED . No I don't think so , but <disfmarker> Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else . That looks different , yeah . Yeah . Hmm . 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is <disfmarker> Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ? Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . Yeah , okay . Yeah , but mm like when you push it <gap> Yeah , then then won't <disfmarker> Then you won't see it . n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see <disfmarker> It must be around it then . Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the <disfmarker> A green light is flashing Yeah , then <disfmarker> Yeah . Not not not not here , but here . or <disfmarker> Yeah . There . Yeah . Maybe uh <disfmarker> <gap> The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? Yeah , we're thinking about it . Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh If you push <disfmarker> It lights up . Everything lights up . everything lights up . That's a good idea . Yeah . Why ain't that on a remote control ? It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . It's f Yeah . Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . Mm-hmm . It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED . Yeah . No , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use <disfmarker> Yeah , I uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's a good idea , okay . Yeah . We'll have enough power to <disfmarker> Everything agre Everyone agrees with that , or <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Yep . Maybe what Paul said , uh under the <disfmarker> on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps . Yeah , and then you <disfmarker> Okay , yeah . And also it's <disfmarker> But you have to make a sound device in it then . Yeah , there must be sound in it . Hmm . But <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , I dunno . it shouldn't take much <disfmarker> Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be <disfmarker> Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . Uh I th Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half . Bec Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special . Yeah , okay . I think uh you also have uh <vocalsound> remote controls with a lot of options . So <disfmarker> But we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh <disfmarker> Uh . We have to give our customers some extras . Yeah . Yeah , okay . I think we will save money with that . Okay . Are you almost finished or just <disfmarker> Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out . Because I was short on time . Okay . Okay . No worry . But um <disfmarker> Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration . Yeah , I just want to talk some <disfmarker> about some more . So maybe you have to <disfmarker> Yeah ? Yeah ? Okay . Okay . So this <disfmarker> Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ? So uh <disfmarker> Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um <disfmarker> Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so , No , No . and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . but <disfmarker> Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is <disfmarker> Uh . Yeah . Hmm . We definitely should use it . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier . And um the the forty plus people , I already told you . Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . <vocalsound> Okay . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . Oh . Mm . Okay , that's <disfmarker> It changes things . I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well . <vocalsound> So does it make some decision about that ? <vocalsound> Changes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> That kinda changes the whole situation . Uh <disfmarker> Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . That still stays . Yeah . Yeah . That's important I think and <disfmarker> L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think . And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . Oh . Yeah . Mm ah <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you <disfmarker> Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . <vocalsound> No , it's not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . No . So , but uh <disfmarker> Yeah . What other features can we put in ? Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the <disfmarker> Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . But uh some of you had uh something to read about um <vocalsound> uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ? That's very <disfmarker> That's fancy . That's cool . I didn't read <disfmarker> It's very fashion . I didn't read any Twelve and you've got twelve . b Yeah . Yeah okay . Mm . Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . I I know . Mm . That should be cool . Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . If it's possible , But <disfmarker> I dunno . Yeah , I don't know . I didn't read it . I don't think it's very expensive actually . Mm . Why should it ? Uh if i if i Yeah , I think it's <disfmarker> You only have a microphone in it . Yeah . I didn't have information about that . But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or <disfmarker> Nah , maybe <disfmarker> Ah that's a problem , but <disfmarker> And and uh w Yeah ? Uh only in English . Only in English I think . What <disfmarker> But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh <disfmarker> Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever but <disfmarker> No , uh one to have in channel one ? that <disfmarker> Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do <vocalsound> do we do it ? It's more if we if we do it . Yeah , I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at . And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing Yeah . or <disfmarker> Is <disfmarker> Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . It <disfmarker> We have short time to to put it on the market , Yeah , I dunno . so that <disfmarker> Okay . We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . Mm <disfmarker> Yeah well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , I think so . <gap> We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . <gap> Yeah , and uh and uh <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages . I d Yeah . Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . And and <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah . I think so . and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh <vocalsound> Yeah . A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one . the remote away . Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay . Yeah , it's not uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Well yeah , that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one , But <disfmarker> Hmm yeah , T_V_ one . but <disfmarker> Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . Well Yeah . I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough . Mm-hmm . So we have to make some decisions . So you can see on the uh <disfmarker> Okay , no speech recognition . So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do <disfmarker> Yeah , I think so . If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ? Yeah , that's good . Yep . Okay , we just take that one . And what else , we have <disfmarker> Also the one in the dark . So uh <disfmarker> It lights up when it's dark ? Yeah , I didn't <disfmarker> but it's <disfmarker> Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . If you push something , it it all lights up . Okay . Yeah . Yeah yeah , Yeah , but um <disfmarker> it it mustn't work all the time . Yes , that's what I mean . It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . So if you <disfmarker> Or you can switch it on or something . No , Or maybe when you <disfmarker> if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . yeah . It lights up all . Yeah , that's right . You have to <disfmarker> Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . Okay yeah . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah . And do we use a a <disfmarker> Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , <gap> if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control . Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . Mm , maybe it's a good idea . Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts . Yeah . Oh yeah . Like uh phones . Different colours . Okay , so y you just make it th through <disfmarker> You look through it ? Hmm . A see-through . Mm , that's cool . Yeah . Uh as an option maybe . Okay . And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top , It's the standard <disfmarker> and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . Yeah , uh <disfmarker> But you have <disfmarker> You had a lot of different buttons . Yeah , we but we don't <disfmarker> We don't really have any complicated buttons . Hmm . Yeah , maybe you have you have to <disfmarker> Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . Yeah okay , but <disfmarker> Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little <disfmarker> O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . No , I don't need don't need <disfmarker> Because you ne almost never use it . Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . Yeah , that's right . So uh <disfmarker> I use teletext as well . No , I use te teletext every day , I think . Hmm . Okay . Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Yeah yeah , one level . Okay . Mm . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , I think the design is most important . Yeah . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much . Yeah . 'Cause <gap> simple buttons . If you put one above it , it's clear . Okay . Okay . So that's it for toda for <disfmarker> We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> How long is lunch break ? So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it . You get your meal and everything , so <disfmarker> Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine . Yeah . Yo . So , we're finished for t for this time . We're going to have some lunch . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bye . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> Yeah . Yeah . <gap> <gap> Mm . Uh . <gap> <gap> <gap> <gap> <gap> <vocalsound> <gap>
<vocalsound> So let's start our second me meeting on <vocalsound> conceptual design . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So , as the previous meeting I will be the secretary Mm-hmm . and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh <disfmarker> No y you do the minutes first , or ? What ? No ? I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . Okay . Yep . So , we'll <disfmarker> Yeah . S technical accessoire ? No no no . Interface ? Yeah . This . Mm . So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller . The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller . Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um Mm . Mm . A nice one . attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . <vocalsound> I'm not sure the one in the middle <vocalsound> is very attractive . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's very , you know if you're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's very big , <vocalsound> yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . <vocalsound> Or to recognise it , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . yeah . Yeah , why not . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . so . Mm . So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart , Mm-hmm . Mm . so maybe we should uh use um uh technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um With this advanced features we <disfmarker> I think we can attract a lot of user . Okay . Okay . Something else ? No . There <disfmarker> this is the three concepts of our controller . Yeah . I just have one question , Yeah . because for the intelligent controller , <vocalsound> you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , Yeah . but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Yeah , so <disfmarker> Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? Y <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe . or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ? Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . Yeah , sure . For example , if you cannot find your uh <vocalsound> controller , you can just uh <vocalsound> just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . I Oh yeah , <vocalsound> that's a good <disfmarker> that's a good point , so . That's true . <vocalsound> One and <disfmarker> Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . So you can use your gesture . That's no problem . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah but how how is <disfmarker> how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? Broken arm ? For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yep . <vocalsound> But this this <disfmarker> but this would never happen anyway . Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time . Why ? Yeah <disfmarker> If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme , Yeah , but the <disfmarker> so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , <vocalsound> Yeah but <vocalsound> Yeah Yeah , it's very interesting . <vocalsound> Yeah but this <disfmarker> so . but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control Yeah . because the <disfmarker> Yeah . I don't think it <disfmarker> Yeah , but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . <vocalsound> That's right . You're not you're not obliged to share it . Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . Yeah , we can <disfmarker> Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . yeah . Even you h you have the controller , I can <vocalsound> I can say channel three , No . <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> it's <gap> <vocalsound> so it's c come to channel three , No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . I don't have to <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage . It's advantage . Yeah . And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to Yeah , but one other question . manual controllers , eh . How how much will it cost ? No , more expensive maybe . How much ? Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working . No no we we d we we just are use um <disfmarker> Uh if you if if you use the basic <disfmarker> Some some efficient . No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . So you think it won't cost an <disfmarker> Not a lot for us ? Or ? Yeah , I think it's uh <disfmarker> because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh uh <disfmarker> it's uh <disfmarker> yeah . But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . It's <disfmarker> Because then you need uh <disfmarker> I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example . Well y y you have also the language problem , No it's uh <disfmarker> Even for the f um because the the vocabulary <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> you know when you <disfmarker> Mm-mm . 'Cause it it have to be universal , so . Yeah . I agree with uh <disfmarker> The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem . Yeah . Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're <disfmarker> we want to sell it in France . Yeah . The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , Yeah . so . Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our <disfmarker> the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or <disfmarker> Yeah mechanism . but you know . The product <disfmarker> The pro It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French . <vocalsound> It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm , okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's <disfmarker> And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . But <disfmarker> Yeah , So <disfmarker> but how will you <disfmarker> Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . If you have the language , you have to develop for each country . Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation . Yeah , but for each country you have to do one , Yeah . because uh the for example for Se <vocalsound> Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to <disfmarker> Oh really ? <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . Yeah , but then w Seems to be quite complex . Yeah , we have to take care of the twelve Euros Comple No , it's not so complex <vocalsound> . problem . And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? No no no it's not <disfmarker> I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just <disfmarker> the microphone is embedded in the controller . Yeah , but where is the controller ? Okay . Where is the controller ? Yeah . It's in your family , in your home . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , but then it's it's like this uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but we're <disfmarker> here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology . Yeah . Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here . A microphone maybe . Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . You just want to interact with television . Yeah yeah just <disfmarker> you just put the controller here , then you I if you say one , he switch to channel , you use your command <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . and you do s your gesture . but you can lose it . No no it's n y <vocalsound> <disfmarker> if you lose it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay you <disfmarker> so you can build a kind of black box Devic and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone <vocalsound> inside your remote control . Yeah . Ah . But you would still have the buttons . Or is it <disfmarker> do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? think it <disfmarker> we should give the uh flexibility to the user Okay , and we think <disfmarker> so you <disfmarker> yeah . yeah . Yeah , You can see <disfmarker> they can switch form one modality to another . Mm . Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky . Yeah . I think so . No , that's quite inter quite attractive . And maybe it will be quite <disfmarker> But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so <disfmarker> although y y Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , Yeah but i i <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> I dunno . We should have confidence in technology . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , we should . <vocalsound> Uh . Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer . Mm . What ? Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? If if <disfmarker> I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . More features , yeah . But if if if it like doubles uh Yeah , but <disfmarker> I think he need a control that is very reliable , no one would would be interested . so . So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Just want to have something <disfmarker> controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . Yeah You think it's possible ? but if if you stick to um <disfmarker> stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . No , I mean <disfmarker> Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that <disfmarker> It's not really the <disfmarker> we Y we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so <disfmarker> or something like that . But uh I think a user need <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , No , but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , but <disfmarker> Don't have a <disfmarker> the the <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah if we can send email from it . But it's not the <disfmarker> only the problem <disfmarker> only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ . No . No . Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if <disfmarker> Cause for example <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , Yeah . Yeah , but uh we want so but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . Yeah , you wou you would <disfmarker> True . That's <disfmarker> the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our <disfmarker> from other products . Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . Yeah <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , uh <disfmarker> And for all the person of the family maybe , Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? You don't need to tune it . so , yeah . Yeah , why not ? I mean , for example the goo y If it's <disfmarker> Because you have new <disfmarker> you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . Yeah . Yeah . I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . Google is <vocalsound> is simple , works fine , Yeah . so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . Yeah . Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . Uh thi this <disfmarker> I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> then nn if he has something that works fine and is really <vocalsound> fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . no . Tha Not too expensive too . But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . See <vocalsound> <disfmarker> That's the problem , That's the same <disfmarker> yeah . yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . Yeah . <vocalsound> Ye <vocalsound> But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so . Yeah . Okay . So I mean , that's the point . let's go to the Industrial Designer . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , Okay . Yeah . so . Two ? Yeah , participant two um <disfmarker> Working ? <vocalsound> Yeah , working design , so . <vocalsound> So I think <disfmarker> I can <disfmarker> Can you go to the <vocalsound> next one ? I uh <disfmarker> it's not this one . It's uh oth the oth <vocalsound> so I <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's the working design . Sorry . <vocalsound> Component design . It's okay <vocalsound> So this yeah <disfmarker> so this is the described use <disfmarker> What ? <vocalsound> Are you inst Uh I think there's something wrong with your <disfmarker> It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it . Maybe you you record it somewhere else . I don't think so . Participant one . Participant one . Interface concept . No . Hmm . Mm mm . Oh . Maybe I record recorded directly on the <disfmarker> Computer . Yeah . Uh . <vocalsound> Dunno . Nope . <vocalsound> Okay , okay . Yes . It seems that we have a problem with the <disfmarker> I dunno if you remember what you had to say or <disfmarker> I can say it to you without . Yeah , so <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe we can first come to No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh <disfmarker> uh to Frahan . With Frahan , I think it's more interesting what he says , then you can prepare your slides , okay . then present it later . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , exac <vocalsound> You will had s some more information in <disfmarker> Okay . I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation . Yeah . Yeah , true . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> In fact , I don't know , So . I s Okay . because i in my presentation I don't have here with <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> Okay , never mind . It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r Okay . <vocalsound> of the remote control . Okay . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside Okay . and <disfmarker> so . So I <disfmarker> in fact the the <disfmarker> f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so Mm-hmm . will <disfmarker> it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and <vocalsound> in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , Mm-hmm . so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . Okay . Okay . And the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation Uh-huh . or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . and <disfmarker> so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control Yeah . Yeah , yeah mm . and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , <vocalsound> no ? Alrigh In fact , having them both will <disfmarker> if we want to have battery , regular battery and and <vocalsound> the solar energy battery it could be <disfmarker> it'll it will add a little bit of the price , So . but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , Yeah . Okay . so hmm . And what tha what about the uh materials ? And the materials , it depends for example you <disfmarker> if you have a wooden material it can be more <disfmarker> the plastic material is more common it's very resistant Impersonal , mm-hmm . but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , Yeah . Special for <disfmarker> or you know , you can have some <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah , and i if you <disfmarker> we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . Mm-hmm . Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm . and it can be interesting . Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm . And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . Yeah , we want something easy to use and <disfmarker> so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . And you think that we will be <disfmarker> Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , Okay . so . So <gap> wood . And what about the buttons ? I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know <vocalsound> lighted buttons because , you know , it's <disfmarker> I don't know <vocalsound> um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion No it's fashion , yeah . and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess . <vocalsound> I think a touch screen <vocalsound> will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . Mm . But <disfmarker> And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> So you got email ? I dunno . <vocalsound> I think we have only <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh five minutes left . Okay . Participant four ? Functional requirements ? Uh no , trend watching . <vocalsound> The other one . <vocalsound> This one ? Yeah . Uh , I think so , just <disfmarker> Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next . <vocalsound> So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and <disfmarker> I mean <vocalsound> i i it sounds good technically Mm . Mm . but it's it's not what they want and uh <disfmarker> So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . Okay . At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . <gap> Now i if we look at fashion in general um <disfmarker> Okay . Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , Ah yes . so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah . 'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . Okay . So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris And fruit and vegetables yeah . we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , <vocalsound> Spongy <vocalsound> 'Kay . okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . Okay , yeah , yeah . I dunno . Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? Yeah thi this is this would be like um Pla plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh S Very stuff <disfmarker> Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah . device , so um Yeah . Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . Okay . So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , <vocalsound> as you say you want something technologically innovative , Yeah . maybe using solar energy and <disfmarker> with battery would be something interesting , Solar . Yeah , so when I think it's <disfmarker> Okay . maybe will attract Mm-hmm Yeah . It will be a <disfmarker> pro-ecology consumers . Yeah . Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . Yeah , I think <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Case . Later ? <vocalsound> So you think <gap> case . Something spongy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Someth no wood . <vocalsound> No wood but <disfmarker> Plastic ? Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . Would some <disfmarker> Pla Maybe you <disfmarker> I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . Yeah , maybe the base . It depends on the design we want , so . It's it's natural . But still y Yeah , it's natural Yeah . Th The feeling is natural , and i so maybe we can stay with wood . And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . Mm , yeah , it's not right , so . But it's still fashion . But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or Okay . I dunno . Yeah , something that you can <vocalsound> into it . Yeah . Uh and what about the user interface concept ? <vocalsound> Google and <disfmarker> Google and fancy ? and fancy , f how about the the voice ? Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . <vocalsound> And <vocalsound> Uh yes . Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It It is an an interesting concept to see <disfmarker> to have uh voice control . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . The smart controller . <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah . But <disfmarker> and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , so . <vocalsound> Yeah , but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so . That's true . Yeah <disfmarker> d Okay . I dunno . So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , Mm . maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . Yeah . It's good . And L_C_D_ buttons . Yeah , L_C_D_ . Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . Yeah , yeah , yeah . And pf what can we think a supplement to <disfmarker> What interface ? Yeah , for the interface something <disfmarker> added value . I think the supplement can be the voice <vocalsound> . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of <disfmarker> With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use Yeah , yeah . commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . Yeah . Mm . Mm-hmm . To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . Yeah , turning <vocalsound> <disfmarker> yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so . So , adding some vocal commands . Yeah . Simple ones ? Yeah , simple ones for <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes <vocalsound> so <vocalsound> we'll <disfmarker> you will all have to work in in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yep . Yeah . Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons <vocalsound> <vocalsound> expensive buttons <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah , to make some new <disfmarker> and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . Yeah . Okay , fruits . Yeah . If possible . Okay . And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really <disfmarker> it will be seen in the remote control . Need it to be , okay . So you will have <disfmarker> Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype Yeah . and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . so you will have to model model something . Okay . Yep And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . Okay . So , Okay . no more questions , we can close the session . Hmm . Sounds good , mm-hmm . Okay . Yeah . Okay , cool . Okay .
Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh <vocalsound> uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh <vocalsound> just as vital to this project Mm . um <vocalsound> I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um <disfmarker> designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um . <vocalsound> What's uh <disfmarker> the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh <vocalsound> everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um <gap> everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh <disfmarker> uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you <disfmarker> you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew . Oh my name's Andrew I'm a <disfmarker> I'm the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to <gap> like <disfmarker> and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . Right <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm Kendra Kendra . and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um <vocalsound> I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be <vocalsound> working on the design . Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so . Right . Yep , I'm just open to being creative . <vocalsound> Uh I'm Katie , Yep , good . I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , very very quickly , um <vocalsound> this <disfmarker> I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . Everybody says what they <gap> what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario . User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up <vocalsound> and think oh yes that's <disfmarker> it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that <disfmarker> I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh <vocalsound> let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um <disfmarker> In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um So I I <disfmarker> everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal . Um , badger . <vocalsound> Mm and why ? Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black <vocalsound> and white and uh <vocalsound> Uh-huh . I feel they're <gap> underdog kind of status and they're , the Oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'cause of the the white streaks in it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um probably a duck Kendra . I just <disfmarker> I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . Uh-huh . Right , okay . Uh 's horses , no particular reason why <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Uh-huh , <gap> fair enough yeah . I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think homo sapien because of their <disfmarker> their uh overall ability to uh uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sorry ? to make T_V_ remotes <vocalsound> . Indeed absolutely yes , <vocalsound> tha that's um <disfmarker> Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh <disfmarker> we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . <vocalsound> It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . Um , okay , um <vocalsound> would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . Well I think <disfmarker> I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . Um , but that <disfmarker> it's easy to <gap> if you can switch back and forth instead of having to <vocalsound> press a bunch of different buttons No . and <disfmarker> so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know . Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ? Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think it's important that you should be able to <disfmarker> when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it <disfmarker> the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal . Yeah . Yeah . Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and <gap> T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't Mm . like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain . Like it's very <disfmarker> a very <disfmarker> Mm . like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like <disfmarker> Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . Um what so wh what's in in <disfmarker> what particular style features are you thinking about ? <vocalsound> Um . Something that looks looks <disfmarker> doesn't look like remote control . <vocalsound> So if you want , <vocalsound> something that looks like uh <disfmarker> something that makes you think oh what's this ? Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , but it makes you think oh . Uh-huh . So , <gap> . Yeah sorry that's a bit vague <vocalsound> . d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , <vocalsound> people won't see it as a remote control um and uh <disfmarker> Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . Uh-huh . Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a <disfmarker> of remote controls ? I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things Mm . Mm . and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , <vocalsound> so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better . I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops Mm . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . and s you know some quite fancy ones Yeah . um than the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> some from personal experience which look nice <vocalsound> but <vocalsound> aren't particularly comfortable . Yeah . Um <vocalsound> any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh <disfmarker> Well from the mouse idea you could , <gap> remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want <gap> <disfmarker> could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . Yes , I mean <vocalsound> the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh Mm . I suppose . fi find the button buttons easily . Easily , yeah yeah . But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them <disfmarker> be kind of down so you could feel them Mm . Mm . better . Yeah , that's uh <disfmarker> must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh <disfmarker> certainly be different . Um do we need it to uh <disfmarker> I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . Do we do we want uh <disfmarker> Mm that would be good . Like a like a mobile phone ? Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Mm , yeah that would be good . Mm . Okay . So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um <disfmarker> the planet with ? <vocalsound> Mm-hmm , um <vocalsound> especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . <vocalsound> Oh sorry , four million of 'em , but uh <disfmarker> I think if w if we market it as as not as not <disfmarker> well this <disfmarker> you c you could either market it as the point of view <disfmarker> we could have the two <disfmarker> we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable Mm . and like you just <disfmarker> it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , Mm-hmm . but that might <disfmarker> considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , therefore they want it so <disfmarker> make it practical at the same time . I think it's <disfmarker> this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh Mm-hmm . is practically sound . Mm-hmm . Okay , yeah , yeah , well So um , I dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . If you <gap> . I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim <disfmarker> need to aim for for all of . Mm . <vocalsound> Um okay well first thoughts on um the the industrial design side . <vocalsound> Oh I think it's it's <disfmarker> remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's <disfmarker> you depend on them so much , but you don't <disfmarker> i i it's <disfmarker> you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna <disfmarker> something's gonna get messed up eventually . They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's <gap> <disfmarker> God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Indeed . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> it just <disfmarker> it needs to be very effective , very <disfmarker> always dependable . Uh I don't think we should make it too small I <disfmarker> 'cause I think it needs to <gap> it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . Yeah . But <disfmarker> so yes dependable , and have a <gap> good medium range size . Okay , and um colours , materials ? Kendra , anyone ? <vocalsound> Well , most <disfmarker> I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , <vocalsound> <gap> . so maybe we should go with something different or be able to <disfmarker> I was just thinking of um <vocalsound> what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um <disfmarker> what are they called ? Like the face-plates Yeah . Mm , mm-hmm . that you change so we could have maybe <disfmarker> I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety Uh-huh . so people can get different different things . Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , Right . probably just plastic because that's always the lightest . Yeah . Okay that's uh <disfmarker> Again I don't think that's ever been done before , <vocalsound> it's uh the sort of <gap> the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh might need so . Uh Andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ? Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with <disfmarker> like you buy it with several uh like you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh <vocalsound> maybe thinking of that , it's <disfmarker> considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing <disfmarker> like a second campaign to market new facials for your <disfmarker> to your <disfmarker> might go a bit astray Mm . since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one Yeah . and then forget about it . Unless you were trying to <disfmarker> Yeah . Well you could come up with like novelty ones , I think <disfmarker> like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh it's <disfmarker> and sorta stagger the release of them that's a that's a good idea . and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money . Yeah . Mm-mm . Mm . Right , okay Yeah true . I think we've got um a good idea now . We uh <disfmarker> meeting is uh <disfmarker> Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . So uh um we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . Um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . Uh thank you very much indeed . <vocalsound> <gap> . Okay . Thank you .
<vocalsound> I'm proud of it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I'll take minutes . The <disfmarker> what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . Yeah . Um then It does look very cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . <vocalsound> Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S And then do we get to make a remote control ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Cause we missed out . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So <vocalsound> it's now <disfmarker> I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . Uh-huh . Is that right ? How how much do we have , forty minutes ? Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . Yeah , Yeah . until about four fifteen . Yeah . So yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so . Go for it . Do you want <disfmarker> So , you said um <disfmarker> are are we starting with the the <disfmarker> Yes . Presentation . so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> It's a bit um phallic . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , but it's it's just an a approximation . <vocalsound> Dual use , perfect . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Dual use , perfect . <vocalsound> Oh , <vocalsound> <gap> your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? <vocalsound> Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . Sorry , sorry . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . So now we we have the <disfmarker> okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . Mm-hmm . And we have the user interface o in here Wow . and uh <vocalsound> the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah . Uh yeah . And it's <disfmarker> the whole thing's made of rubber , is that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah . Rubber . Yeah , <gap> . Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be <gap> and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , so we said the back side round , yeah . well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . It l does look like the <gap> curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Hmm . And it's spongy as well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the <vocalsound> on the cover we just have the very basic things . <vocalsound> Huh . Mm-hmm . So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three <disfmarker> there would be numbers in in the <disfmarker> on the actual one . Yeah . So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . <vocalsound> Six seven eight nine . I like that . Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . Yeah . And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and <disfmarker> like the previous one and the next one . Uh-huh . And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . So where's the volume ? Yeah . The volume is is scrolling . On the side , It's on the side . this one . Ah , you did get that in then , Yeah you just do it like this . mm-hmm . And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . Oh okay , <gap> . Mm-hmm . See ? So the volume is <vocalsound> you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , <vocalsound> okay , there there you have the screen Yeah . and and you have the mm <vocalsound> spinning wheel with options to choose . Mm-hmm . You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . Mm-hmm . Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . <vocalsound> Uh no , we we'd not put <gap> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> A mute button . Yeah . Well , <gap> we'll have this on the screen , on the display . so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . Y or you could have it <disfmarker> so you <disfmarker> on the wheel if you <disfmarker> On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . Well , but the but the mute <disfmarker> yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? But if you hold it in , Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? Mm . if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? Okay , yeah , okay . Okay , cool . So that <gap> that solves the whole mute issue . Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . You can't really see it in the interface . <gap> no . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere . Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well . Mm-hmm , very good . So I think it <disfmarker> And it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . Yeah . <gap> . Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . Cool . Mm-hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> We ran out of resources here , so . <vocalsound> In the actual one . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So if you have questions . You can have a look . <vocalsound> Very good , let's have a look . <vocalsound> Test it out . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . <vocalsound> Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . <vocalsound> But yeah , uh that's cool , cool . Very good . Mm-hmm . Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria Okay . and then we'll there <disfmarker> Yeah , see the budget . I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wales . <vocalsound> Wales , for example . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Fabulous , Marketing Expert . yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer <disfmarker> prepare the evaluation of the new design . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like <disfmarker> so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay ? Cool , so these are what they are . Oh <disfmarker> So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ? Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Mm dots , never mind . Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . <vocalsound> Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I agree . Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? Yeah . Yeah , just prepare one now . Shall I just prepare it now ? <vocalsound> Yeah . It will be red , too . Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That's this one . What do you all say ? <vocalsound> S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? So ? I reckon it <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . I I go for seven . Seven , yeah , Oh <vocalsound> we're all so proud of the <gap> . <vocalsound> Yes . it's terribly sexy . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . Could <disfmarker> oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . Ah , okay . Okay . Excellent . Except we can't <disfmarker> Yeah . uh we can if we <disfmarker> But that's alright . But we can we can <disfmarker> If you take a note of them , I can I can take note uh uh <disfmarker> then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine . and then I'll put them in in a minute . Okay , so <vocalsound> we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? Yeah . Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? I would think yes , yeah . Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , I think it does . Yeah . I mean <disfmarker> so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m <vocalsound> model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . Alright . Yeah . But that's gonna be a problem , But then <disfmarker> yeah . 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . Yeah . Yeah . So bu it's it's not a huge problem , I th I think it's not <vocalsound> it's not like it's a pen . because i i it is operatable . But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , Yeah . so they just <disfmarker> Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , Yeah . but they can normally do most things right-handed , Yeah . so I would say it's not such a big issue . Right . Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , Mm-hmm . Yeah . so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yep . So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . Mm . So maybe we need to put <disfmarker> that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? Um <disfmarker> What do you what do you all think ? Six . Or maybe six , Mm . because it's just one one i one among the issues , Yeah , I think I think for um <disfmarker> I mean . Yeah . I mean most people are right-handed , so in <vocalsound> in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , Yeah . but we might want to flag it for management , they want <disfmarker> might want to um <disfmarker> One more thing is that i Okay . It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , They <disfmarker> so it opens on the side . So <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . No , yeah , but mm but we have it <vocalsound> nicely <vocalsound> with the hinges here <gap> yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah , So it won't be a problem , Yeah . I mean <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So you guys can decide wh whether <disfmarker> it will be <disfmarker> and it will be <disfmarker> it won't be heavy . Oops . I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . Yeah well yeah , Yeah , but we <disfmarker> which makes it kind of really big , yeah . but it's it's a bit long . The length is gonna be difficu It's a little bit long . Yeah um <disfmarker> Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? <vocalsound> Uh this this kind of uh makes it more <gap> Mm . Because <disfmarker> S uh slightly smaller . and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . So you have to keep that side flat . Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . Okay . So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . Right . Okay . Um <vocalsound> okay , Okay . so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? No , No , we're gonna put it like <disfmarker> we've got we have a locator . th there's the locator dot . There's a locator . Cool , Mm that you stick on T_V_ . so that means you need a <disfmarker> that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , Mm . doesn't it ? To make it beep . Yeah well w Yeah . Or a buzzer . Yeah . but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some <disfmarker> to make some sounds , so <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . Yeah . So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ? Yep . Fabulous . D_ . Intuitive , completely intuitive . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . If <vocalsound> uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's <disfmarker> I th I think it's <disfmarker> Yeah . I'd say six , 'cause the <disfmarker> I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , Yeah . but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . Intuitive . Yeah , and I mean d So <disfmarker> And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni Might be <disfmarker> so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . But it <disfmarker> and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . Yeah . Yeah . So , should we maybe say f a five So l Five ? and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , Yeah . but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Yeah , okay . I'm happy with five ? Yep . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive but <disfmarker> Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . Yep . But otherwise it's superb . So , should we give it a six ? Six . Six ? Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design <disfmarker> well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , Yeah . <gap> . but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , Yeah . Yeah , yeah ? See . unless you are a all the time sitting . Yeah , so it's kinda <disfmarker> Yeah . Well we've banned them from <disfmarker> Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , <vocalsound> Mm yeah . so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . Yeah . And moreover it it has um <vocalsound> L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . Yeah . Yeah , it's varied . Yeah . Six ? Okay , so we give that a six , yeah . Okay , F_ . <vocalsound> Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> it does have <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Absolutely . Voice control have seven . Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just <disfmarker> Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . Oh okay , cool . Um <vocalsound> right , so <vocalsound> . So it has voice control . Yes , so that's a seven then . Yep . Um , cool . G_ technologically innovative . <vocalsound> Anyway it ha yeah , Technologi <gap> well <disfmarker> it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is <disfmarker> yeah , it's kind of new . Yeah . Yeah , but I mean you don't <disfmarker> All of the components have been used in other things before . But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think . But do <disfmarker> yeah , yeah . Yeah . <gap> . What do you reckon , five , six ? Yeah , what do you all think ? Six . Six ? <vocalsound> Yeah . I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , that's it , I mean <disfmarker> It still has to do what i what it has to do . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? <vocalsound> So , I don't think many peop Space remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's it , they can take it with them . Put fashion in electronics . <vocalsound> Absolutely . <vocalsound> Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? <vocalsound> Yeah , sure . The carrot banana remote . <vocalsound> It's the maximum fashion . <vocalsound> So , we give it seven , Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . and we write <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> There we go . So I think we've done very well , I think that's a <gap> . but <disfmarker> Cool . Very good . <vocalsound> What's the assessment ? Yeah . So , we need the average here , so we got <disfmarker> The average is about six and something . <vocalsound> Yeah , one . A little bit over six . Seven <disfmarker> Or a seven <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> There are how many sixes ? No , wait , So we've got four sevens , One , two , three . a little bit under six . so that's twenty eight , No , wait . Three . three sixes , And one five . eighteen . Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . <vocalsound> Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . Six point point <disfmarker> Fifty one divided by <disfmarker> Six point something , yeah . Two three four <disfmarker> Seven eight . about six point five . <vocalsound> Six point five , yeah . Close enough . Okay , that's pretty good , I think . <vocalsound> Now wait until we <vocalsound> get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . <vocalsound> That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? Um no , that's it , That's it ? yeah . Alright . So , finance . And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . <vocalsound> Cool , there we go . Sorry , this is <disfmarker> I'm just um <disfmarker> <gap> . There we go and there are the marks . Beautiful . Yeah . Not anymore . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Computer no signal ? Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost . <vocalsound> More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . One simple battery . Mm . No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . Advanced , yeah . We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . Yep . Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . Yeah , yes . Case material we said rubber . Rubber . Yep . I don't know what special colour means . Mm anything uh I think which is not more <gap> . <vocalsound> I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ? It could be <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . Rub rubber comes coloured , Yeah . it's <disfmarker> I would <disfmarker> <vocalsound> maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , Yeah , <gap> yeah yeah , okay . let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . We we're definitely going to have to <disfmarker> We have pushbuttons , so we've got pushbutton , Mm . and then we've scro we have scroll wheel as well . Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? S yeah , yeah , No uh we we have uh yeah . we had , for muting , yeah . Yeah . And we have L_C_ display and <disfmarker> yeah . And button supplements . Um <disfmarker> Mm no . <gap> . No . We don't have <disfmarker> No . No ? we're not using any of that . Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel <disfmarker> But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have <disfmarker> think <disfmarker> maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? Yeah . Okay , let's <gap> yeah . We've got more than one pushbutton though , <vocalsound> haven't we ? I think the pushbutton <disfmarker> oh . 'Cause then you have <disfmarker> I don't know if that's one <disfmarker> That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . Yeah . That seems unlikely . Push what uh Huh ? Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . Twelve point five . whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we <disfmarker> We have to count all of them , or <disfmarker> yeah . Mm I don't think so , no . I don't think that makes sense . No . Well it doesn't , but it uh <disfmarker> No it says what what is the kind of interface , No . if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel <disfmarker> so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , Yeah . And L_C_ display . Yeah . Yeah . so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . Yeah . So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . <vocalsound> Wh wh what's our criteria ? This sample sensor <gap> . Our budget's twelve point five . Uh okay . Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . Yeah , so that has implications though for the <gap> . Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . <gap> when you say <disfmarker> when you press one it says one or it says hello . Yeah . For the locator . But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? Yeah . Mm <vocalsound> and the locator also goes away . We can afford to get rid of it . But it was very no innovative Yeah . So that means no locator , does it ? <gap> innovativeness <gap> . Well um <disfmarker> yeah . I mean does <disfmarker> What else does it need ? Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . This would be <disfmarker> Yeah , yeah yeah <vocalsound> Yeah . there you record your samples your speech samples and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , okay , so we <disfmarker> A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um <disfmarker> yeah . Uh-huh . Okay , yeah . Right , so we need one fifty off . Um <disfmarker> See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause <disfmarker> Take it down to just a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> We could do <disfmarker> So tha that <vocalsound> mean that we cannot press <disfmarker> Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? If <vocalsound> in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . But that's <disfmarker> well you would just have to to spin it down <gap> . Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . Mm-hmm . So that's point three . No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . But I mean <vocalsound> we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . If you <disfmarker> Yeah , I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_ <disfmarker> That's with the L_C_ That comes with the L_C_D_ ? Yeah . We decided , 'cause it's not on our list . Yeah . Oh so so the the this is <disfmarker> Mm . The scroll wheel is on the side . <gap> . So <vocalsound> we're adding costs for <gap> right , okay uh I mean I think this is good . So <disfmarker> S so we're point three over . We're point three over at the moment . It's nothing n Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah . Yeah , I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but <disfmarker> I have <disfmarker> Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up <disfmarker> for up and down . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah . On the side . Yeah . Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . Okay , yeah . Rather than having three different things that people have to do . <vocalsound> <gap> . Okay . There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve <gap> , couldn't we ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . Yeah , but <gap> <disfmarker> So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that <gap> Yeah . and then I'll take <disfmarker> I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , <vocalsound> We have , yeah . Yeah . yeah . Yeah . Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? No . No , I don't think so . Not really , no . Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . Mm . Yeah . We <disfmarker> Yeah . instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . We just got rid of a gimmick that was never <gap> anyway , Yeah . Um yeah . and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was <disfmarker> it's not a great difference I don't think . Yeah . Yeah . Alright then . <vocalsound> But we lose the locator . <vocalsound> Well <gap> we're going to have a beeping thing . Really ? We're gonna have a beep . So instead of speaker , <gap> . But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , Yeah . so we still have the locate . Yeah . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Cool . That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Tha Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh the the beeper thing . <gap> . But it can be yellow as well . It <disfmarker> It can come in the same colour as the the case . 'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . You know , your pen vibrates ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we've designed a banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well done , team . <vocalsound> Um we need <disfmarker> we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . <vocalsound> I think it mm <disfmarker> Cool . Feedback ? Ideas ? Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . Yeah . So , had we known <disfmarker> If we'd had that sheet at the beginning <gap> should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . <vocalsound> Yeah , that or not , yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . So <vocalsound> d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . Yeah , mm . I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . Mm-hmm . It wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't <vocalsound> st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating <vocalsound> remote control <vocalsound> shaped like a banana , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um yeah , so yeah . Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . And the pens . <vocalsound> Uh I like the pens . <vocalsound> We like the pens . <vocalsound> I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down Yeah yeah yeah , and have it printed out when you got back to the office . Yeah , yeah . that's it's it's <disfmarker> They great ? I wonder what one of these costs . <vocalsound> Do you think they'd notice if one went ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't think you should say that was the recording . Oh okay . Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . <vocalsound> Yep . Shh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yep . Okay . But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the <disfmarker> I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . yep . Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . The thing flew in , Mm-hmm . you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , Yeah . 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little <disfmarker> But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , Mm . I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> back it , <vocalsound> this is <disfmarker> just had to be changed <vocalsound> . And <disfmarker> yeah , so <disfmarker> cool . Yeah . Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? And presumably you don't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you can say nasty things as well . <vocalsound> Yeah . I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . I have no stake in it . Yeah , definitely . Yeah . You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . I'll leave the room and you can have another go . I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Better than that than the banana . And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . I think it worked quite well . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? To express them mm mm Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , no . so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <gap> . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about . Well it's it's it's pretty new , Yeah . <vocalsound> pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and <disfmarker> Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , Yeah , neither neither do I , maybe somebody's already though of it . but I've never seen anything <vocalsound> and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Hmm . Yeah . I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . Yeah , that's right . <vocalsound> That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a <gap> remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Patent patent patent . Mm . Banana remote . I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , but we've got no way of finding out . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That vibrates <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Flip . Vibrate <vocalsound> Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . . And uh <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Nothing that you really want . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> True . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . So , costs are within budget , Yes . <vocalsound> Yes . well within budget , including a little <disfmarker> what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . Um we've evaluated the project . Yes . You've got the scores . And it's fabulous . Can you put that in the project documents file ? It's in the project documents <gap> . It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any <disfmarker> was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . Yeah . Otherwise it's it's all fine . Yeah , yeah , Mm-hmm . sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . <vocalsound> I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our time . Yeah , we've got like five minutes left . We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . Yeah . We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . <vocalsound> We certainly are , Yeah . mm . Yeah . Yes . So I would say that's the end of that meeting . <vocalsound> Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . Thank you , team . 'Kay . <vocalsound> Yeah , same here . <vocalsound> It was very productive day and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We could draw animals on the board again . <vocalsound> Mm uh no . <vocalsound> Mm uh no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't think so . <vocalsound> You can make some animals . I don't like Play-Doh , no . Oh , you don't like anim <vocalsound> It's just minging . It smells so bad . <vocalsound> It doesn't ? It does . Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet . Mm . Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . Was there a questionnaire already sent ? I don't know if it's already sent or not . No , it hasn't been . Um presumably I have to <disfmarker> Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? I don't see why you can't stay here , really . Okay , so the other way . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Did I save this one ? Production costs . <vocalsound> I made your animal for you . <vocalsound> It was supposed to be pink . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , that's the one <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But it was blue on the board .
<vocalsound> Alright , yeah . <gap> crack on <gap> . Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , <vocalsound> L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . Um we were also going to use <gap> novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . Um that pretty much sums up the last one . So we'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible . <vocalsound> Uh uh okay . Um uh the con today is the concep today . I'll just <disfmarker> This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um <disfmarker> Sorry about this . <gap> . And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , can we uh outsource these from elsewhere , um will we have to construct any items ourselves ? <vocalsound> Uh I have a presentation <gap> I just saved it in the uh the folder . Yeah , okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then . Um <vocalsound> . Which one do y Uh . Oh , interface concept ? Yeah , that's me . That's you . We've got trend watching , that's you . It's uh <disfmarker> Components design . Components design . <gap> . Okay . Alright . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh . The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . Uh but later on <gap> we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . So uh we decide what it's gonna be . Probably plastic . Uh we need the infra-red transmitter . Get that off the shelf . Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . Um <vocalsound> if you go on to the next slide . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If you go on to f uh findings , it's like two or three slides down . Right . So , Okay . this is what I found we can use . Uh three different types of batteries . Um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one . Okay . Um . Now , the kinetic one , we've <disfmarker> 'cause that's the ones where like you <disfmarker> the movement causes it . Cost is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? Mm . There's also a watch moves around a great deal more . Do you think ? Uh . <vocalsound> Yeah . W Yeah , I don't think it would . Um . And solar cells , I dunno about that . <gap> yeah . Uh . We should probably just use conventional batteries . Um , just like in usual remote controls . Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ? Um . Yeah . Um . <vocalsound> And these are three different types of <disfmarker> or two different types <disfmarker> three different types of shapes you can have . Uh one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . Um <vocalsound> the materials are tha there as you can see , but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , <vocalsound> uh which would be <disfmarker> Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? Yeah , Is it not also it's expensive ? and light . Uh , i think so as well , yeah . They make mountain bikes out of that , Um . Um . don't they . So it's really light as well . Curious . Um , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? Um . <vocalsound> T yeah . Um could you maybe draw something ? I you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two . Uh . Well for a curved , well I was thinking to <disfmarker> f for to sit in your <disfmarker> the palm of your hand . Uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe um an okay button around here , so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . Um I don't exactly <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Double curved . It probably means <disfmarker> this is probably double curved . Uh whereas a single curved would be like that . I guess . Or not necessarily . So it might literally just be <disfmarker> Two curves <gap> . okay . Yeah like that . Whereas this is two curves . Um <vocalsound> so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve . Alright . Um which obviously <disfmarker> it looks better than the single curve , but uh you can't have it in titanium , which is uh a nice material . <vocalsound> Uh Mm . and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . Uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . So you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . Um <vocalsound> if you want the buttons to be <disfmarker> oh yeah , if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . But <vocalsound> you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . So um I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . Do you think ? Okay , that was definitely something we can talk about . Um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ? Yeah . So , depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display . Um , do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ? Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . Is that <disfmarker> did I <disfmarker> Well I think compared to say just pressing <gap> buttons . Yep . Advanced , like three eight six advance . <gap> if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . Okay . Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made . Okay , sure . Mm . If I've not over-stepped . Yeah ? Yeah i Okay , um should I go on , or go back ? Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm , if we only have twelve Pounds fifty , twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ? Well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such . I assume . Okay , that's good point . We have to look into the costs of those . So , sorry . Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . Okay . And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh to uh get sent to the chip . So that's just how the control works inside . Um we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use . <gap> . Okay . Um . <gap> . So in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ? Um <disfmarker> I think we can do it if <vocalsound> uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . Um and then maybe use single curved uh case . Because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . Um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ . Um I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . Um conventional battery would seem to make sense . Um I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved Mm-hmm . and I'm <disfmarker> I don't know about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? <gap> . Mm . Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail . Okay . I also have a preference for rubber . Okay , well um <disfmarker> Based on my research . Yeah , well will we move on to user interface , and <disfmarker> yeah ? <gap> . Um sorry , Mm . as long as <disfmarker> were you ? Yep I'm finished . Yeah . Okay . Um <gap> and d d d interface concept . Yep . Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh Yeah . <vocalsound> and the white board 'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time . Uh um I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if <vocalsound> so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . Um so uh next slide , if you please . Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um <vocalsound> v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f <vocalsound> and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um <gap> digital . Ah , okay . f f f <vocalsound> for di for digital or um or for <vocalsound> or for cable , whatever , you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . And or um <gap> box . So it's not <vocalsound> I'm not really excessively concerned about that . You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right <vocalsound> left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . Um , so you Can I just jump in slightly there ? Mm-hmm . That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . Yes , absolutely . <gap> okay . Um , basi <vocalsound> basically what I <vocalsound> basically what the <vocalsound> what <gap> be having um , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the L_C_ <vocalsound> the L_C_D_ and the uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The joystick would be in the right place . And <vocalsound> also this is <gap> a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the <vocalsound> the um you know the whole thing you know <vocalsound> it should have sort of organic feel to it Mm . that it should be , you know , soft to touch and can be moved around all nice . Um okay Okay . Um , yeah . on to <vocalsound> on to the next uh to the next slide . Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well , Okay . because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , I guess . Yeah , 'kay basically um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I can add pretty pictures to this . The um <disfmarker> Assuming the hand <vocalsound> the hand to be in about sort of this position , um <gap> hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . Um and it would need t there would need to be a <disfmarker> it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . So . You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . You just have big <vocalsound> two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can <vocalsound> in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . Um , and that <disfmarker> Is this the joystick ? Th <vocalsound> this part here is the joystick . This would be the actual grip . Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well . Okay . That would be probably the bulkiest part . And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . So it would fit just nicely in the hand . And again , this part could be rotated , so it can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . Um <disfmarker> So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . Um now programming it <vocalsound> actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . Programming them can be a right pain . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer some <vocalsound> some fair iv <gap> fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you <disfmarker> on your <gap> computer just so that you could um pr <vocalsound> program it at a rather <vocalsound> in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . Um though you <disfmarker> i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a <vocalsound> ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . Mm . Um . But uh . Yeah . Okay . That's that's my idea . <vocalsound> Excellent , right . Um <vocalsound> uh . Mm . 'Kay . File open . <vocalsound> We go . Trend watching . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> So uh to gather my research , two basic methods . We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , what's what's the new black , you know , <vocalsound> Okay . as it goes . <vocalsound> Next slide please . Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know . <vocalsound> They want it to be <disfmarker> that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . Technology technical <disfmarker> technologically innovative . People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . So like the interface is really important . <vocalsound> And easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important <disfmarker> I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . People want it <disfmarker> I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , <gap> prefer it to have the newest features . And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . <vocalsound> The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . How that relates to a remote control I don't know . <vocalsound> But I I see <vocalsound> I come on to that in the next in the next slide . Spongy . I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . Well spongy's the new black as well . So we have the choice between rubber and plastic . If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then <disfmarker> can I skip the rest ? <vocalsound> Oh yeah , I forgot to mention that . The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . Okay . Okay , <vocalsound> Forgot to say that . so kinda spongy material . So um so Okay . my personal opinion ? <vocalsound> Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , that's that's different , you know , that's <disfmarker> everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool . Like , titanium is cool but it's expensive . And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . Um <vocalsound> I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for <disfmarker> it's the up to the interface guy . So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . It could be something like , I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . So I think cool is the key . <vocalsound> Few questions about a spongy remote control . I've never seen one before . I've seen plastic remote controls . I think maybe they were <disfmarker> I don't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being Mm-hmm . sturdy , you know . For being strong and sturdy . So um if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know . I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . So how do things fit it ? And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus <gap> doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg . We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . People like spongy material . If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . And also , this was this year . So , things change all the time , every year you know they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . Well next year something else is gonna be the new black Mm-hmm . and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff . 'Kay . Okay . That's me . Well , um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . You always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . Um . Mm-hmm . Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , so <disfmarker> I don't exactly what cost would be incurred . Um I can see your point about the number keypad , but I've <disfmarker> I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um <gap> boxes as well um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be <disfmarker> Yeah , actually <gap> if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau <vocalsound> <gap> it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . It's just irritating . <vocalsound> That's a good point . You can incorporate names into the menu . Mm-hmm . But if you h <vocalsound> but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them . Okay . So you <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Even news , music . Like they do on uh sky digital kinda . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , say something like um lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um <disfmarker> Looks like we <gap> going for a double curved design . Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . Though I'd have to say <vocalsound> depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . Yeah , I I would say definitely , I mean <vocalsound> I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? So <disfmarker> I can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ? That would be a worry of mine . Mm <gap> . If you're going with the fruit and veg thing , <vocalsound> looks like a banana . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a <vocalsound> a structural weakness , F if you wanna design it that way . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , and I think would look rather co I mean <vocalsound> mi <vocalsound> rather cool . I mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice , <vocalsound> it makes it <vocalsound> makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control , but uh . Yeah , we won't add that functionality . <vocalsound> Okay . Course not . <vocalsound> However , one interesting point is , I don't know how serious you were there , but we <disfmarker> if we take some of the ideas <gap> why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? Yeah . Sure , yeah . Okay . I dunno . It's an <disfmarker> certainly a different colour from your average um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Make it harder to lose , as well . Yeah . That's true . <vocalsound> Sure . Was there anything in your research <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , <vocalsound> it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Y you know , you lose the monkey <disfmarker> the banana , <vocalsound> <gap> monkey <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> y <vocalsound> you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . I th uh I mean if it <disfmarker> I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default . Um . S oh , I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . Mm-hmm . But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know . Well basi <vocalsound> basically the um for <vocalsound> f for uh <disfmarker> I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic <vocalsound> will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to . Mm-hmm . It's not simply a matter of frequency . Yeah . So um <vocalsound> usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi <vocalsound> you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes Mm-hmm . you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that Mm-hmm . come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one . That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it <gap> . Yeah , that's right . Okay . So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ and then they maybe look up different names of um <vocalsound> different actual units that have been produced . Yeah . Yeah . Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such . Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ? Um booklet . <vocalsound> Some pages . <vocalsound> I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , so once every s Yeah . Doesn't have to be used very often that's right , yeah . Yeah , Yeah . and it's <disfmarker> But it's a but it's a nuisance . And it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it , Mm . so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . <vocalsound> If you <disfmarker> if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's <vocalsound> that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . Um mm . Mm . Okay , this <disfmarker> <gap> just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . Mm . I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . This is the conceptual one . Um . I think we've come up <disfmarker> I think we've covered everything we need to here . Um I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . Um <disfmarker> So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . Um looking from <vocalsound> <disfmarker> prototyping of some des description using clay . Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh <vocalsound> progress . Um <disfmarker> The user interface design , They're kind of <disfmarker> it looks they're <disfmarker> the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas <vocalsound> possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ? Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ? Mm . Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are <vocalsound> are made , I would say . Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . Mm-hmm , that's very true . <vocalsound> Um . Okay . Um got product evaluation as well . Um . Yeah , you see I don't <disfmarker> some of these things kinda logically follow the others . How can <disfmarker> t product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . <vocalsound> I I think we'd be <disfmarker> yeah , no , it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with . Oh , that's the <disfmarker> okay , sure sure sure . Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places Mm-hmm . which I suppose is quite similar . Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? Um <disfmarker> Okay , sure . At this stage we still have no no target audience or <disfmarker> I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . 'Kay . Um <vocalsound> the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying And it's stylish . if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . Mm-hmm . Maybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow . Mm . Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device . Yep . Okay . Yeah . Think that's well within the normal bracket . Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . That one might have to be based on <disfmarker> Programmable memory as well . The U_S_B_ for which ? For the remote control . The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming Oh right , okay . due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . We've w definitely talking some type of <disfmarker> Um . But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , or are we gonna <disfmarker> It's just for T_V_ , but for Different . programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . Okay , yeah . I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . Mm . We don't know unless <disfmarker> it would make sense to . But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . Yeah , I mean it's <disfmarker> Well something that doesn't <disfmarker> you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power . Yeah . Yeah . The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha <vocalsound> it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway . Yeah . Um f <vocalsound> for one <vocalsound> for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be um o ought to be customisable and uh <disfmarker> Different languages , uh different skins and stuff like that . Mm-hmm . W Mm-hmm . How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . That sort of thing . Sure . <vocalsound> I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open <disfmarker> it is supposed to be international , right ? So . It would make sense to . I would say to . It would make sense if you could <disfmarker> Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well . Okay . We've already had the five minute warning , so . Um . I would say yeah . International would make sense . Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh we'll see how that goes . Um . <vocalsound> Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know . <vocalsound> So um Where is the clay ? <vocalsound> do <disfmarker> I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ? Yeah . <gap> they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . Mm-hmm . The fruit and veg . This one . <vocalsound> Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing . <vocalsound> Bu <vocalsound> but um but the spongy idea I like . I like it a lot . <vocalsound> We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . I <gap> having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose . Sure . I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , but we wanna keep the company brand as well , <vocalsound> Yeah . so . Mm-hmm . So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um . Mm . Yeah . I was <vocalsound> like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button . Okay . And I think that says it all really . <vocalsound> I think so too . Right . See everybody in a half hour . Sa
<vocalsound> Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , what we going to do . Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes . So , um no presentation for me . Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Afterwards some uh Yo . J_ and J_ . <vocalsound> eval eval evalu Evaluation . Evaluation . Evaluation criteria . evaluation s <vocalsound> sorry . <vocalsound> Uh evaluation crit criteria . Uh , in combination with the finance I um <vocalsound> uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file <vocalsound> Hmm . which we have to fill in later on . Um , you see . Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . Hmm . Interesting . Ah , okay . <vocalsound> Oops . So , that's uh that's a big <vocalsound> Cool . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . That's gonna be t problem . l so let's uh wait it uh um <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Some creative uh <disfmarker> we have we have must <disfmarker> uh , we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh <disfmarker> yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . Oh . Yeah . And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the <disfmarker> all uh all this . And uh afterwards , uh we closing . Once again , forty minutes , so uh let's start . Ok okay . I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . Shall I give a short introduction and then uh <disfmarker> Yeah , well sure . J_ and J_ . Okay . J_ and J_ . <vocalsound> J_ and J_ , okay . Jane and Jane . <vocalsound> 'Kay guys , take it away . Hi . Take it away . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , this was our first concept . We decided to use a single touch-screen . So , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . <vocalsound> So , we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning . No ? This uh isn't nothing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Idea maybe uh is better . <vocalsound> Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily . And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too , of course . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we began uh working out a concept . Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . We have the <gap> more advanced menu uh setting right here . We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . We made a top <disfmarker> oh , or a front view . Just so like you wanna uh back view . As you can see , this uh <disfmarker> there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . And uh this is for the artistic effect . Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture <gap> later on <gap> <vocalsound> you have more b a better idea after that . But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh <disfmarker> with these two . Hmm . And so when you put it on the table , it will just <gap> lay down . It won't <vocalsound> uh roll around or stuff . But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old uh phones . Mm . Y you you may get the idea . So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , like we discussed early on . Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round . Yeah , the panel just uh of course goes like this . Yeah . But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff . Okay . No , okay . And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh <gap> put some electronics uh that would <disfmarker> you can make a more thinner uh design , Yeah . and that would actually look very nice , yeah . Yeah . And uh , about the colour , what have <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this <disfmarker> maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres . So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips . S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some <disfmarker> have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip . Okay . Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh yeah . Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . It uh <disfmarker> you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us . 'S l <disfmarker> it's like an uh Easter egg . Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children . Yeah . We we want a more adult version . But , this is like a remote control for children . <vocalsound> It's called a weemote <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . A weemote . Weemote . Yeah . Weemote . Hey , that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wait what I w got in mind . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So this actually basic the idea . We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this . Mm-hmm . Yeah , I can imagine that . <vocalsound> And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . Those are the technological colours actually , Yeah . so it d It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , Or blue or whatever . but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , Hmm . they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh <disfmarker> Hmm . Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . Well , um I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . So , there must be some cheap standard cover , Hmm . Mm . um maybe white or something , that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money . Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . Oui okay . Uh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it , uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . Okay . So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , The other way around , you mean . <gap> Oh yeah . and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that . Uh-huh . Yeah . They want uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> they want more luxury stuff , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . Mm-hmm . Okay . So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , maybe <disfmarker> yeah , perhaps you're right . Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . Okay , yeah . An another idea . Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . Yeah . <vocalsound> They'll please the elder users as well . Yeah . Well yeah , a colour of <disfmarker> a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yes . Nah . Yeah . And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . Not not too uh <disfmarker> yeah . This is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . Yeah . Or blue or <disfmarker> Not too , but w a little , Ah . Mm-hmm . Yeah , because that's our aim . li like like this like this . Yeah . This isn't this isn't too much , is it ? Yeah . Yeah , okay . No . Yeah . <gap> . I f Well , the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of <gap> Well I I I think so . Yeah . <vocalsound> The buttons , I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , except for the buttons it's <disfmarker> it could be a standard model . yeah . It <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Yeah , uh something like this would be nice . Okay . Okay . Okay , that's that's it from us . Thank you . 'Kay , it's my time now . It's my turn . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The Marketing Expert . <vocalsound> Uh-oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> During the <disfmarker> Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> During the design uh design life-cycle we uh <vocalsound> Sorry . <vocalsound> we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements . <vocalsound> So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale . Opening a Word document now . Okay . One <disfmarker> oh , okay , uh I have to expla explain something . We have to uh be consensive about about things . So , it has to be a group uh group decision . Okay ? Okay , so we gon we gonna evaluate the Uh <disfmarker> We're going to vote . We <disfmarker> yeah ? The prototype . Yeah , the the thing we <gap> saw . Yeah . Okay , just saw . Okay , one . The remote control is designed for people with age below forty . Yeah . Seven ? <vocalsound> Seven is false . <vocalsound> Uh , true . Yeah , b one or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sorry . Yeah , one I think . Most true ? Why ? Yeah , it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty . Mm . Yeah , Yeah . Yeah . so <disfmarker> so a o one is appropriate ? So <disfmarker> Or , more like a four . No no , a little more in the middle . No , I have <disfmarker> Three . uh three or <disfmarker> yeah . I've <disfmarker> Yeah , two or three , because it's not just <disfmarker> uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . Okay . But it's also designed for people of age above forty . So , Ah , exactly . Exactly . I'll say it's about three . Yeah , it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty , but also appealing to <disfmarker> Okay . Three . <vocalsound> Yeah . But also for <disfmarker> yeah , okay . Uh , second . The remote control is beautiful . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wow . <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> acco according to us , it's one ? Or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , I I think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> it's the marketing uh angle on television . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> p s We have a wonderful <disfmarker> Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well , it's also fancy then . Three . Uh , the remote control looks fancy . Yes . Yeah . Yeah . One ? Of course . We have a perfect remote . Yes . Yep . Good . Four . The remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons . Yes . Yeah yeah , oh they have to agree but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yes . Leads to user face , yeah . Daniel . I'm the User Interface uh Expert . <vocalsound> Uh , teletext buttons and volume buttons ? Um , uh no . No teletext buttons . Teletext is in the menu . You you've different menu . False ? Yeah , false . And volume is impo And volume ? yeah . Volume is true . True . Uh , hmm . Big and clear ? <vocalsound> Yeah , the they are big and clear . <gap> . Yeah yeah , big and clear . Yeah , big and clear . But you could make a teletext button uh six . Hey . Otherwise , the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button . Hey . Hide . <vocalsound> Yeah , but but the teletext button . Yeah , you can ch That's in a menu . <vocalsound> It's it's not <disfmarker> So , it's w yeah , it <disfmarker> it it yeah , it <disfmarker> it isn't entirely unclear , J but <disfmarker> So , I wouldn't give it a seven . I would give it a more a five or a six . No . Yeah . Five ? Okay . Uh , I don I don't know . What do you think , uh Mister Project Manager ? Yeah , it's it's <disfmarker> yeah . Oh , okay . Well , I agree . <vocalsound> I was thinking very black and white . Hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Black and red . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thank you J_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , don't forget to save it . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Red . <vocalsound> Okay . Volume . The remote control is easy to be found . Uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Fruity . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it has these <disfmarker> all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . <vocalsound> Yeah . So , if you so if you have <vocalsound> trouble finding it <disfmarker> But , um it it's not making any sound uh , <vocalsound> have we deciding ? Oh , okay , but <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? <vocalsound> It'll make a difference . We have the better re <vocalsound> I don't know . Yeah , I think so . My remote control's black . A li little bit maybe ? A little bit , but <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . Four ? Uh <disfmarker> Fi <vocalsound> K yeah . So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . I <disfmarker> Fo fo yeah fo five is <gap> . Ah , I I I think five . It's it's <disfmarker> it doesn't really make a lot of <disfmarker> Well , then uh then I'll go for four . Four ? <vocalsound> Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . Yeah , okay , you're right . Uh , <vocalsound> Yes , but five is between four and six . <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> so I'll I'll go for four . Ah , you must see it as uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think . Wha Yeah . B_ . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , that that's a better question actually . Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . it <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> Exa I think that that's what it's about . If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ? If it <disfmarker> if this lying on your couch , you're you're <disfmarker> you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing . Yeah , yeah . But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , that's stupid . <vocalsound> Like , no not uh not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Uh , but when you lost it you're just not <disfmarker> But , okay . Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . <vocalsound> That's our remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Yeah , I I agree , I agree . Yeah , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it's under your <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , what is that . Uh , Okay . so it's <disfmarker> Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . Uh <disfmarker> Eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours . True . <vocalsound> Um I would call uh <disfmarker> choose two , <vocalsound> 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not <gap> . Yeah , yeah , not too flashy . Yeah . The remote control is made of soft material . <vocalsound> Um , Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft . kinda soft , but but not this <gap> . Yeah , but not too soft we have decided . Three ? Yeah . Three , yeah . Yeah . Yeah yeah , easy to use , Easy to use . One . <vocalsound> very afford . Easy to use ? Yeah , can it be zero ? <vocalsound> Well , <vocalsound> I don yeah , it is kind of <disfmarker> Top easy to use ? It's it's not the most easy to use <disfmarker> It <disfmarker> No , No . Uh <disfmarker> you can do two , because um It can be easier . it can be easier . It could <disfmarker> yeah . Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest . But then you're l yeah , but then you'll lose <gap> Functional ability . Yeah . function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so . Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button But <disfmarker> It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . <vocalsound> on t <vocalsound> Yeah , okay , but easy n not not the most easy to use , I think . <gap> . <gap> No , it's it <disfmarker> I I'll go for two . No . My vote's on two . <vocalsound> Two ? Yeah , m mine too . Okay , two . Yeah , two . We also have to compare it to the uh to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So <disfmarker> Yeah , but waits just a minutes . Inspiration . What's the time ? We also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff . These are the m regular remotes . Yeah yeah , I'm uh hurrying . Okay , eleven . <vocalsound> The remote control is innovative . Yeah . Yes , true , one . Yes . A very <disfmarker> You're agree , Tim ? of course . You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris ? <vocalsound> The remote control has m remova <vocalsound> removable <gap> from Multilux . <vocalsound> Yes , one . Very multifunctional . No . <vocalsound> The remote control , i it has speech recognition . False . Yes , False . it <disfmarker> This is used with speech recognition , this . The remote control has built-in games ? Yes . <vocalsound> But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh <disfmarker> it's not an entire game . Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one . Yeah , they are built in . Yeah . Yeah , okay . Not down . <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> <vocalsound> And the last , paren <vocalsound> parental advisory function . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You really like the parental advisory . <vocalsound> Yes . Freak . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yes , <vocalsound> I do . Th did you make this or the <disfmarker> Bu Save as . Yeah , he made it . <vocalsound> Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> It changes it maybe . Okay , I will uh Oh yay . do the the math . Oh dear . Now it's your turn . Okay , thank you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We'll see . Hmm ? Mm . Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost . If it's under uh twelve and half Euro , then it's uh ok uh okay . But i is it <disfmarker> if it is b Huh ? No , this isn't right . Okay so , <gap> . Redesign . If they're under twelve fifty . Oh yeah , if they under <disfmarker> Yeah . No . Oh yeah . Yeah , it's <disfmarker> Yeah ? Cau 'cause <disfmarker> so it's okay . <vocalsound> sorry . Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it . Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So <disfmarker> Uh , we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components . We have to uh fil uh , want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . So , do we have uh a hand dynamo ? No . No . That's zero . Me , too . Battery , yes . One . Yes . Battery , one ? Yeah . One , yeah . Okay . Kinetic , one . Kinetic , one ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , solar cells , zero . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , uh simple chip on print ? Uh , n no . No . No ? Advanced chip . No . No , advanced chip . No . Yes . Sample sensor sample speaker ? No , the advanced chip is uh <disfmarker> No . Advanced chip is three . Three ? Three Euros , yep . Yeah . Uh , we have one . We have one <disfmarker> Yeah uh , but it it's one one thing , it's three Euro . Okay , one piece , yeah . <gap> . No , sev zero . Uh , what's the sample sensor ? No . Well , that's um <disfmarker> Speech recognition , I think . Yeah , yeah , speech recognition you give it a sample , uh one . Okay . and s Zero . Uh , uncurved flat . No . No . A zero . No . But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and then uh <disfmarker> No . You <disfmarker> no . No . No . Thingy . <vocalsound> no ? Okay . <vocalsound> So it's only uh once double-curved . Yeah . Yes , Yeah , 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the <disfmarker> three . Eight . Okay . We're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet . <vocalsound> Uh , we don't have anything else . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , go on . Just go on . <vocalsound> Okay , but uh we have <disfmarker> Just go on . Then we'll see uh <disfmarker> we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget . Okay . Could you step a little to the right ma Two . Yeah . Oh , sorry . Two . Uh , rubber . Or <disfmarker> You . Zero . And zero . Titanium , no ? <vocalsound> Special uh <disfmarker> is the special colour ? Special colour ? Mm . I don't think so . No , this is a standard colour . No . <vocalsound> Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> S <vocalsound> Yes , this is a special colour . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour . <vocalsound> Yeah , but but D but Daniel , tha that's that's another brand . <vocalsound> That's an add-on . Yeah , one . That's another article to sell . Yeah . Yeah , but we we going to <disfmarker> yeah yeah , that's true . But yeah , it's it's <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> Uh , j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back , aye ? That doesn't account for this . Producing this . Okay , the push-button , no . No . Scroll wheel , no . Scroll-wheel , no . <gap> <disfmarker> No . No . Oh , no . <gap> <disfmarker> Yes , one . One , yeah . Uh , button , no . No . No . No , the the <disfmarker> Mm , is it <disfmarker> we don't have a s These three . No . No . No . Well , we're only four Euro over budget . no . Okay . Oh , okay . So <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> So , um what's the thing we can change ? No . No . Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . Yeah . Uh , can I uh I say something ? Mm , single-curves . Yeah , of course . <vocalsound> No , can I say something uh as Project Manager ? Yeah . Just cut off the kine The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , yeah . because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . Yeah . Okay , sure . Or <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , we just put a good battery it it . Yeah . Mobile phones nowadays . Daniel . Daniel , Yeah . Yo . what do you think about <disfmarker> Here . Sorry , yeah , yes . <vocalsound> What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station Yeah . just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> rechargeable batteries in it and just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . Yeah , and not really <gap> . Yeah , yeah , okay . But we <disfmarker> if you forget about the kinetic , Just an idea . Yeah , Yeah , sure . Yeah . that's a cost reduc well if we do that , we shall <gap> . Ah . <vocalsound> Okay , well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved . So um <disfmarker> Yeah , of course . And that would solve the budget problem . Uh , b but i but the single-curved is just <disfmarker> oh <disfmarker> Yeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then <disfmarker> Yeah . It's just <disfmarker> yeah well , the single-curve that <disfmarker> No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or <disfmarker> Oh , okay , okay . Yeah . Exactly , yeah . <vocalsound> Or are these two curves ? Uh <disfmarker> So that's wh tha that's one option . Yeah . <vocalsound> And then w yeah , and then we could have it , Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> but uh <disfmarker> it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look . <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , but what else uh do we have to cut out ? We going to cut <disfmarker> No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem . No , tho uh that that can be done . Yeah . So uh , Although , can we make it with a regular chip ? okay , a little less uh conversation . Curvy . Hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? Sorry ? The blue blue uh Fill in <gap> <disfmarker> Just a Okay . Explanation . explanation . Twelve fifty . <vocalsound> I can delete it for you if you want . Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , no no . So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . And we're done . Yeah , but does it fit with our design ? Do we have to u adapt it ? <vocalsound> Uh well , the only uh thing that don't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's single-curves . Yeah , single-curved , but there's a curve in it . So <disfmarker> Yeah . W Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we're uh has <disfmarker> Yeah , we just make it flat . Okay . But , wha 'Kay , look , But , you do l what is the uh <disfmarker> If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . More . Yeah . But <disfmarker> You make it optional . No , but does it have a lot of extra uh <gap> Function . Functional . fun function more like <disfmarker> Worth , does it have added worth ? Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . Yeah . No , um <disfmarker> Yeah , it's really a static value . Yeah . Yeah , uh aesthetic . I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . But <disfmarker> I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price . Yeah , well let's assume it is . Yeah , it is . Oh . No , we can't go above that . Yeah ? We we should assume it i that it is . Yeah , okay . Yeah . Yeah , okay . Then it's okay . But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . R if you uh promote a kinetic um <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an <disfmarker> a normal remote control . Yeah . Yeah . Do you think ? Yeah , I think so . Well , now you can shake your remote <gap> control . <vocalsound> No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . <vocalsound> Kinetic . You have standard old battery control uh remote con Yeah . Yeah . What a what about all the m the environment freaks ? Yeah . Not freaks , Yeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So <disfmarker> the envi <vocalsound> No . True . I I think it's it's <disfmarker> It look like this one . You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version . Yeah ? Who <disfmarker> because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , <vocalsound> and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise Yeah . Yeah . thing . And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> then it's uh then it's uh <disfmarker> Yeah , just one big curve . <vocalsound> yeah , one big good curve . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I was going to uh say nasty words , but I don't . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is strange by the way . Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . We thought that wood would be more expensive . Yeah . Uh , this uh American figures . You just cut down some trees . <vocalsound> Yeah , maybe . But uh that <disfmarker> this is this is it ? Yeah . Okay , this is it . This is it . Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium . I'm gonna save it . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> It is possible , but you can't use double uh curves for titanium . No . That's one of the functionability uh <disfmarker> Okay , well , considering we have <disfmarker> Ah no , we have to do all those hours again . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Go back . One back ? Costs on uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No redesign . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign <disfmarker> Yeah . We sue . <vocalsound> Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> okay , yeah . We <vocalsound> Yeah , we'll start her all o all over again . Okay , um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project . Uh , some uh things . Were there uh room for uh <disfmarker> was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? Um <disfmarker> Hmm . I I didn't think so . That <disfmarker> there was a lot of room for it . But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . Yeah . It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu Yeah . Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's true . I agree with that . Well , I th I think you two , <vocalsound> uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project . Yeah . Yeah . That's true . For us , there was a lot of creativity . 'Cause I think m We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's true . I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design <disfmarker> we could have more <disfmarker> we had more room for creativity than than you two . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , that's true . Okay . Uh how about the leadership ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ha . Leadership was uh crappy . <vocalsound> Crappy . <vocalsound> Cra <vocalsound> Nah , the leadership wasn't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Okay , thank you very much . <vocalsound> Nah . No , the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> leadership was okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now we're done . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , example of crappy leadershi No , leadership was uh Okay , yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , Yeah , it was good . I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . Yeah , that's true . Uh , you could have <disfmarker> but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and <disfmarker> Yeah . You could of said , shut up you fool . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . I notice it too . But <disfmarker> I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the About me . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> about the first meeting . <vocalsound> So , uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh Yeah , you made up . <vocalsound> Try to learn from your mistake . <vocalsound> And we will never do it again . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk <disfmarker> No , it <disfmarker> you did better . Yeah , more more consensus . Yeah . Ev everybody w was agreeing every <disfmarker> yeah . Much more constructive . Okay , so uh that's cool . Yeah . Uh , teamwork ? Well , maybe that's uh only <disfmarker> Yeah well , it's for us , because uh <disfmarker> Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . Yeah . Yeah So , it is a little bit <disfmarker> and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . <vocalsound> Yeah . No <disfmarker> But , really teamwork were you two uh <disfmarker> Two guys . Well , it went okay . The <disfmarker> Yeah , that went w it went well . It's it's just uh <disfmarker> Yeah ? <vocalsound> Stupid stupid pen , but uh <disfmarker> No hard feelings . Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Now you you must push a little while . Yeah , but but draw something uh difficult . Yeah , but us <disfmarker> Yeah . D uh just write your name right now . Try to write your name , <gap> Okay . in in writing letters , of course , yeah ? Yeah , normally , uh this uh <disfmarker> the w Block letter sign it , yeah ? O Just uh <disfmarker> Just just write your name in in one line . okay . If it's a little bit too small <disfmarker> <gap> bit quicker now . It didn't <disfmarker> You can be <disfmarker> you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it . Uh he he knows how it works , yeah . <vocalsound> Oh . I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> so I think that's the that's the main issue . Okay . <vocalsound> Um , so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with , Means . <vocalsound> Y well , yeah . um the the the the digital pen . Th the i The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Digital pen , I thought uh th the first time I did individual work , I used it . Yeah . But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting . No . Yeah . No , I have it working . But , uh yeah , well uh <disfmarker> It's it's not real real use for me . No , it doesn't have that much added value to the <disfmarker> Huh . Nee . Well <disfmarker> As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago , it <disfmarker> I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must um <disfmarker> Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . Yeah . I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow . M yeah . Yeah . And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word . Yes . No , and it doesn't give any added value . No , uh that's true . No . Not really , no . And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful , but the the pen is I uh <gap> <disfmarker> not user-friendly , I think . Yeah , not user-friendly . Yeah . Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , <vocalsound> Yeah , and it's it's not very precise . and that's the <disfmarker> We're trying to m to <disfmarker> Yeah , like when you do this . Yeah , it may um <disfmarker> Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah . Smaller . Smaller ? Yeah , smaller . Just like when you're writing on a letter . Yeah , but that's not th the the <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> when you <gap> at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small . No , a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one . It's uh th it it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear uh <gap> when you're uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh . Sorry . But maybe there's some function with <disfmarker> no , it isn't . With uh <disfmarker> And the eraser was another problem . It w t is is this large . <vocalsound> And when you try to erase this line , y <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , I'm gonna erase my uh name . <vocalsound> I'm gonna erase my name there . Yeah , it's a big uh big eraser . Okay . New ideas ? M Abo What kind of new ideas ? Um <disfmarker> Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do you ? Yeah , uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Go on . <vocalsound> I'm just uh <disfmarker> New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm , yeah , I think so . I don't know what what I mean . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hello . Did you heard what he said ? <vocalsound> Know what I mean . <vocalsound> I don't <vocalsound> I don't know what I mean . <vocalsound> Oh , I have some figure . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Here . The eva the evaluation , <vocalsound> Oh . Oh yeah . the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . That's interesting . So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think . Okay , Yeah . because what does it mean ? So true . Uh , that uh All the mo yeah , are between one and two . all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep . Yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Thank you , expert . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ? Not really , just they have to improve it . Not really , yeah ? Uh , the concept is okay , Yeah , I think <disfmarker> but it has to be quicker . Uh , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process Yeah . and it , yeah , just takes too many time . People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and <disfmarker> Yeah . You had expected it to to be uh more more uh <disfmarker> More user-friendly . Yeah . <vocalsound> 'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , Yeah . Yeah . and you do May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . Yeah . And draw it , and it's it's placed over there . Yeah . Yeah , that l Yeah . Would be easier . Or at least when you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you don't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . Hmm ? No . And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . And that's a very bad concept . Yep , yep . Yeah , that's true . Ah , very bad . Nah , okay , I I <disfmarker> it's my opinion that I <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> I think this is better than regular flip-overs , but <disfmarker> Yeah , it's can be saved easier . Yeah . But if you're in normal flip-over <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> a lot of people write text . There's no text option . Yeah . And writing text <disfmarker> uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some <disfmarker> Yeah , and and maybe some uh functions for uh <vocalsound> uh uh circle or uh a square . Yeah . You have to draw it yourself now . Or maybe even insert picture . Yeah . If you have uh some presentation , and you have some f Yeah . Or text function . Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . Yeah . Mean <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , but insert image isn't available ? <vocalsound> 'Cause then you could <disfmarker> Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art . Yeah , that that can be done already . Oh , okay . But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh <disfmarker> So you can <disfmarker> Hyperlink ? Hey , what if you do like hyperlink ? With uh W_W_ dot Google dot com . Type type it ? Oh yeah . Re Real Reaction dot N_L_ . Maybe <gap> . Hmm ? Yes , is <disfmarker> now is okay . Sorry ? Okay ? You'll just make a link in <disfmarker> Huh . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well , that's nice . There's one way to uh <disfmarker> Is it <disfmarker> 'Kay , double-click it . Maybe if if you're not using the eraser <disfmarker> Here . oh . You're erasing . Oh , sorry . Something else th Yeah , arrow . Double-click it . Yeah . Here , that . Okay . Well , it's <disfmarker> So you have <disfmarker> as you saw , you have a little uh <disfmarker> Oh , you can <disfmarker> Yeah , thank you . You can go uh Yeah , okay . there . So there the the the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal , But <disfmarker> and it's it's very <disfmarker> <gap> . it costs a lot of time to uh To use , yeah . to use . Yeah . And that's a pity , if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , Yeah . And that's m and we are now with four people , but it <disfmarker> well , imagine you are here <disfmarker> you're with the ten people and everyone uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's mostly the case , from the <disfmarker> over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind <disfmarker> Yeah . Two minutes of drawing , yeah . Yep . You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . Yeah . And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board . Yeah . What I really miss also is uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> is a d is a turtle <disfmarker> is a decision uh decision system <vocalsound> like um <disfmarker> With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , Yeah yeah . maybe a a l a little application like uh uh <vocalsound> give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . Yeah . Yeah , just like he said with the with the <disfmarker> a screen which you can write , also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism . Yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application . Oh . Just a little group group decision application . Yeah . Yeah . But uh , <gap> problem is , well you can't discuss anything <disfmarker> well you you ca uh you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . Yeah . We <disfmarker> I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three . But , well uh I <disfmarker> we said <disfmarker> uh , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react uh on it . But if you you put a three on it , uh just <vocalsound> figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on . Yeah , okay . Yeah , of course . But , uh you can still discuss about it , Yeah , but it would <disfmarker> <gap> yeah . but but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process . Yeah okay , the <disfmarker> for processing part . <vocalsound> The digit . Yeah . But then uh , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it , that uh isn't that bad idea , actually . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not that your opinion isn't valued , but but still . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Okay . Okay , so <disfmarker> Yo , manager . That's it ? Uh well , just about , <vocalsound> When are w because uh <vocalsound> When are we going to produce it ? <vocalsound> Yeah , tomorrow ? Celebration . Uh , the costs are within the budget . Uh , the project is evaluated . Yeah . Yeah . But , before we going to celebrate , uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer , because uh there must be some kind of end report . I am busy with the end report right now . You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh <disfmarker> What is an end report ? Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided , Yeah . a r r a report of this day . Yeah , yeah . Uh , that must be made , but I don't know , <vocalsound> here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is <disfmarker> Oh , you ha you have ten minutes left , I uh read . Oh . You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report . Okay well , that uh that can be done . Maybe we can do it uh together . You can see what I've uh <disfmarker> Yeah . yeah ? So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board . Yeah , sure . You can see it . Um <disfmarker> Because I think it will uh it must be uh <disfmarker> You you already made a beta version , or <disfmarker> Yeah , it's a three uh <gap> with seventy five uh <disfmarker> Pages . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , just about . <vocalsound> Y yikes . <vocalsound> Seventy five pages . Well , just a moment . End report . Okay , Daniel . <vocalsound> Do you want a chair maybe ? A chairman . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hey ? No no no , I'm just uh <disfmarker> Oh , okay . you can s you can read it and uh <disfmarker> here here it is . End report . So you you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ? Yes . <vocalsound> Well , this not nit it <disfmarker> read-only . But it's not uh fully finished yet . Five minutes for finishing . Um , this is about the functional design , the things <disfmarker> yeah yeah . Management Expert , you have to change that . Oh yeah . I'm uh <disfmarker> Marketing . when I said it , I remember I had it here . It's a read-only version . Yeah , but you can save it u the <disfmarker> under another name . Oh , okay . Marketing Expert , okay . Um about the three functions where <disfmarker> uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . So , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh <disfmarker> yeah . Maybe um the <disfmarker> <gap> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> You <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> No , you have to put <disfmarker> uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second <disfmarker> Oka okay , okay , I <disfmarker> I really <vocalsound> didn't knew that . Oh nay , a volume changing , second . So , this one's first . S switch , yes . You go there and you go there . Yeah . So , okay . Okay , go on . Well , maybe I can then do it one two three . Yes , very good . One two three . If the order is in uh <disfmarker> is is uh important , Yeah . Yeah . that's the word for <gap> . The order . Uh , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> then the conceptual design . Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , so that's <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . Yeah , because <disfmarker> yeah . Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . Single-curves . <vocalsound> Uh , the buttons It's not double . Uh , it's not double anymore , eh ? <disfmarker> Hmm ? A single-curved . Not double anymore . No , okay . Nay but that <disfmarker> this is what um <disfmarker> Yeah , okay . Was initial , the plan . The initial plan . Yeah . Yeah . And the the added functions like Tetris snake , it's under the parental control , <vocalsound> the touch-screen . On thing uh <disfmarker> So , it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh <disfmarker> One small thing uh , the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ? I don't think so , eh ? Ah , it's very cheap . It's very cheap . <vocalsound> Uh , it's very cheap , <vocalsound> you you maybe you you you you come at uh <disfmarker> No , it's it's not very cheap , but that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's very necessary . no , but it's a development inside corporation . <vocalsound> Like , uh w we don't have to buy parental control . Our own people can make that , I think . Yeah , but it still has some <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , it it has some cost , but <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , He'll do it in his free time . So uh <disfmarker> but so we can discuss that uh <vocalsound> Yeah . we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the the board of uh <disfmarker> Of directur or directors . What's it what's the company called ? I just keep forgetting it . Real Reaction . Real Real Reaction . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Real Reaction , yeah . <vocalsound> You can ask your personal <disfmarker> Okay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh <disfmarker> Yeah , the end conclusion . But uh <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now . Okay . Still the end conclusion . That's all , I think . But , i in here nothing uh <disfmarker> Um , the decision to make um the buttons on the top , and the menu on the Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Yes . on the bottom . And clearly <disfmarker> Yeah , touch-screen you've mentioned . Yeah , touch-screen I've mentioned . Yeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , I think . Okay . Why we decided to use a flat uh L_C_D_ . Okay , this n yeah . Yeah , okay , well I gonna redesign uh something now . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> No . Party party <gap> . Because I think it will <disfmarker> Oh , five minutes from <disfmarker> to finish meeting . Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first . Save it . Hmm . You can't <disfmarker> <gap> you can select file and export and then those J_ PEG files . Yeah , but then you had the same thing . Well , eight . And we have uh , <gap> another blank one . Example of children remote . Did we change anything ? <vocalsound> Oh wait . Wait . <vocalsound> Wow . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a new uh <vocalsound> commercial logo . Hmm . That's a pity . Don't save it , aye ? <vocalsound> Oh , that's cool , Tim . Uh , Finish meeting now . Well , I'm I'm why are only the first five SMARTboard files I'm going to finish my end report . saved ? Okay , um hereby is <disfmarker> the meeting is finished . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You declare . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I am the one who can say that . Yeah ? Hereby the meeting is finished . Yeah .
Think we can first <disfmarker> Right it was function F_ eight or something . Mm . This one right there . Tha Okay . Okay . Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ? Think we all <gap> <disfmarker> Huh . You will as well ? Oh I thought we all were . Yeah , I have one too , okay . Okay . <gap> . S Yep . <gap> . Whoops I forgot to put the thing on <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Right . I just wanna <disfmarker> 'cause basically I can't re I've <disfmarker> really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna <disfmarker> rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that <vocalsound> wanted to know your names again . Okay . Okay I'm <disfmarker> <gap> just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll <vocalsound> you know . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Sure , that's a good idea . Okay . I'm Catherine with a C_ . C_A_T_H_ E_R_ I_N_E_ . Okay , and Uh Gabriel . Gabriel . E_L_ is it ? E_L_ . 'Kay . And you're I am Reissa . s r R_E_I_S_S_ <vocalsound> <gap> R_E_I_S_S_A_ . Double S_ A_ , yeah <vocalsound> yeah . Sorry . Okay . <vocalsound> 'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . <vocalsound> Right . True . <vocalsound> Uh , right . Mm 'kay . Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I am your Project Manager , <vocalsound> and , uh yeah , I'm just here to <gap> sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this <disfmarker> for the purposes of this meeting <disfmarker> what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But hopefully you've been <disfmarker> actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna <disfmarker> each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . <vocalsound> Um . Mm . Then we're gonna <vocalsound> work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll <gap> sort of conclude <gap> anything else comes up at the end of it . How long is the meeting ? This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . Okay . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . <vocalsound> No problem . <vocalsound> Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can <disfmarker> you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa , I'm fine . Yeah . are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here I uh yeah , yeah . Think she's finishing up her presentation . or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? <vocalsound> D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation . No no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I'm done . Okay . Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um <disfmarker> well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . I think the first thing we should look at is um <vocalsound> probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . Mm . So that's gonna be you Catherine , Okay . if we wanna hear from you first . Okay . Um just connecting this . Are we getting i You don't have to worry about screwing it in just <disfmarker> Really ? Okay . Cool . there you go . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh <disfmarker> Uh . Okay . <vocalsound> So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've <disfmarker> oh no , you can't see a thing . <vocalsound> Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . Oh . <vocalsound> We it's fine on my screen , Ah . but never mind . So um <vocalsound> the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well <disfmarker> okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called <gap> six , or something like that . Mm-hmm . Uh and then <vocalsound> um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . Mm-hmm . And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design . Great . Okay . Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but <disfmarker> I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . Really ? Cool . Yeah . Um , should I erase this or <disfmarker> Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . Okay . Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? Fine . <vocalsound> Or suggestions ? Is a battery like the only way of <disfmarker> Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , you blow on it and i <vocalsound> No , no <disfmarker> In indoors . <vocalsound> No I meant like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Bicycle power . No 'cause like cha 'cause <disfmarker> always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The battery's down and <disfmarker> maybe <vocalsound> , I dunno , solar charged ? <vocalsound> I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but <disfmarker> Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know . Mm . Yeah . One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . How far away is your television ? Yeah . It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not <disfmarker> doesn't have to go that far , Uh <disfmarker> Well , the thing is uh you you don't <disfmarker> does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the <disfmarker> put the telephone down , and go into the other room . <vocalsound> That's true . Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that How about Bluetooth ? <gap> but <disfmarker> Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth . Why not ? Isn't that a better signal ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's <disfmarker> you're gonna use it . Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you <gap> you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . Mm <vocalsound> . You know we don't need it . It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you <disfmarker> if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , you are gonna <disfmarker> Yeah , exactly . Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . But <disfmarker> We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . It's uh <disfmarker> Mm . Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't <disfmarker> 'S just an idea . Okay . Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . Okay . Do you need the border ? Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh . Okay . <vocalsound> Sorry . Technical <gap> . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Adjusting . Okay , so , while this is warming up , there it is uh . Yeah . So I'm doing the user interface design . Mm-hmm . Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . <gap> we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but <disfmarker> Mm yeah . Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that <vocalsound> seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . Uh , I don't I dunno , Okay . uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you <disfmarker> uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um <vocalsound> freeze frame . Mm-hmm . Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see <vocalsound> what's possible to do , Yeah . you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . Great . And I <disfmarker> judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , <vocalsound> because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . Mm . <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . So uh , yeah , that's me . Great . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units <gap> stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or <disfmarker> No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another <disfmarker> <gap> exists <gap> like you like you said in in mobile phones . Yeah . That was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with <disfmarker> in in all my years in in the remote business . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that <gap> a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? Um <disfmarker> I would say it's <disfmarker> If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be , Yeah . even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , Mm-hmm . 'Kay . it's <gap> like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , Right . but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred <vocalsound> well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . Mm <vocalsound> . You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . Right . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . We put the fashion in electronics . Mm . I think I think we have to carry that mental . There you go . So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control <disfmarker> well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . Mm . Mm . Well yeah these , I think , we can <disfmarker> so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . Yeah . Because we need <disfmarker> I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Great . Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um . Okay , fantastic . Right , well done , Gabriel . Okay . <gap> . Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby . Where does it go into ? <gap> . Here ? Yeah . The blue thing . Uh , yeah , this is getting all <gap> . <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> <gap> . Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . Well , function F_ eight . No <disfmarker> Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . Yeah , it just takes a second uh . oh . <vocalsound> Come on . Right . Okay . <gap> . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave <disfmarker> so this is research <disfmarker> and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um <vocalsound> current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like <disfmarker> like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um <gap> per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel . 'Cause we've only got five channels . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> exactly . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's another thing . <vocalsound> Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like <vocalsound> . I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . Yeah . Yeah . Mm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also <disfmarker> remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . Mm . <vocalsound> So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . Um personal preferences . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Wow . You are a child of technology , aren't you ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um so yeah um <vocalsound> I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um <vocalsound> has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find <vocalsound> , so I don't know whether maybe <disfmarker> and also we asked them whether they wanted <vocalsound> <disfmarker> whether they'd be interested in um <vocalsound> voice activating . <vocalsound> So voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five <disfmarker> this is age , sorry , <gap> age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two <disfmarker> ninety one per cent of them said yes . So there you go , yeah . <vocalsound> Um <vocalsound> so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . <vocalsound> Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah . They they don't . It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and <disfmarker> Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent <gap> say no , so <disfmarker> People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . <vocalsound> For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not <gap> sort of <disfmarker> most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , Yeah , that would be my guess as well . uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . So they don't <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> d and tha Well <disfmarker> and that's a <vocalsound> that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . These guys are growing up . <vocalsound> What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . Yeah . I mean , okay , there's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Voice activation might not be the best . I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . Uh . Um also with um with buttons , <vocalsound> a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Repetitive strain uh Huh ? rep repetitive strain injury Yeah , repetitive strains injury , or like from doing <disfmarker> so they don't <disfmarker> I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . <vocalsound> Well <vocalsound> maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't think so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So y so it's so it's so you got <disfmarker> so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of <disfmarker> Yeah <vocalsound> Mm . maybe not so hard . see <vocalsound> Mm . have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a <disfmarker> Yeah . Let's jus <gap> Maybe <disfmarker> we just want <disfmarker> need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh . Mm . Yeah . <vocalsound> They're having a lunch break at the moment , but <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I'll see if I can get <disfmarker> see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . Yeah . I think we can do some really <disfmarker> in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements . Yeah . Mm . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , Mm . or we just like flat buttons , something . Yeah . Okay . So that is me . That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . <vocalsound> Um okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . Mm . It's gotta be cheap . S um . Mm . Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . <vocalsound> But a in <disfmarker> there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Yep . I think we're all um pretty sussed on that . Um anyone have any questions ? Mm . Everybody happy in their work ? Yeah , it seems like we're all on the <disfmarker> pretty much on the same page . Now <gap> this is good , we've got a good structure going on . We all know where we're going to . <vocalsound> Have you been ge has <disfmarker> have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> Well , just questionnaires . Yeah . Sell <disfmarker> trying to sell your things <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah , <gap> stuff . <vocalsound> Um okay . Do <disfmarker> oh <gap> have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? Yeah , you can . Right . Okay . Do all you all know my e-mail address ? No I don't . I <disfmarker> I think he's participant one , Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . aren't you ? Uh <disfmarker> So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . <vocalsound> Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . Yeah . Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? <vocalsound> Well it's just w it's just You have them i you have them , <vocalsound> <gap> . it's just par participant one , participant two . <vocalsound> but we'll send you an e-mail . Send me , yeah You want to have friends , don't you ? <vocalsound> So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as <gap> <disfmarker> yeah , okay . maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . <vocalsound> Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit <disfmarker> Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white <disfmarker> with yellow borders . Okay . Maybe that's <vocalsound> like getting ahead of ourselves . Well , It wouldn't be <disfmarker> maybe you can come up with a few <disfmarker> with a couple of different ideas ? Mm . Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain ? Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . Mm . It's gotta say <disfmarker> people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , Mm . like if it had a symbol on it . There's loads of companies that called R_R_ . Mm . Whoa . This is slog <gap> but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , Yeah . so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . So we have to have it one colour . Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it . Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . Mm . Not necessarily even if i it just has to <disfmarker> ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products Well you could <disfmarker> as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . Mm . It's got to <disfmarker> It could come <disfmarker> so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere Yeah . <vocalsound> like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . If <gap> . Quite poss yeah . Well this is all your department . Mm okay . <gap> . Well , well done everybody . And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now . Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now . Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? We might possibly have done . Cool . Alright , see you all soon . <vocalsound> If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . <vocalsound> 'Kay uh . Yeah , there you go . Right . I just have to <disfmarker> there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but <disfmarker> Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em . <vocalsound>

Can I close this ? Uh we don't have any changes , do we ? So no . Oh , okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> There we go . Okay , here we are again . Detailed design <disfmarker> oh , come on . Well <disfmarker> Ah <gap> s Forgot to insert the minutes , but it's about the same thing we discussed before . Uh <disfmarker> Could open that anyway , think . Other design <disfmarker> anyway , we took as <disfmarker> we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . We also <gap> that you're just busy with it . Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . Well , we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the <gap> other screen , which is fine . Um <gap> we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . So <vocalsound> then we ca yeah . We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition , but I'll get to that in a moment . 'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . So so , Hmm . like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have 'em now , and it's bad . Anyway . We are Oh . Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . So <vocalsound> you could <gap> <disfmarker> could present that . But um let's see what be handy to do . Nee <disfmarker> no , you just go ahead and present the <disfmarker> w we'll scrap it later because <disfmarker> I think it's more or less the same as we had . <gap> What ? It's basically what we agreed upon , Hmm ? Oh but just a little bit more specified . that's No much s hasn't changed that much , huh ? No no no , not at all . I didn't expect anyway <gap> . You just coloured it . <vocalsound> Uh s Final design . <vocalsound> Basically in <gap> <disfmarker> what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . Mm-hmm . We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow I like the menu . so that it com really shows in this keypad . Mm-hmm . If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . So <disfmarker> And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose . Probab Yeah . I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to <disfmarker> That's the be Hmm . And it <disfmarker> I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber Yeah , of course . than to uh <disfmarker> Mm yeah . That's uh the integration story again . Okay . So we have it's a bit round shaped , <vocalsound> Oh yeah . that's what we had uh <disfmarker> We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . Mm-hmm . So that's basically what we chose there . Okay . If you have anything to add , please interrupt me . No , uh this is just a description of what we see there . So <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh . Yeah . Speaks for itself . That's pretty much it . <vocalsound> Okay . Now it's my time to ruin everything . Well , not ruin everything , but <disfmarker> Oh sorry . <vocalsound> no , nah . Finances , that's what we have here , what you drew . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh <disfmarker> for speak recognition anyway . So which <disfmarker> you see the <disfmarker> which is de o one of the most expensive parts . So <disfmarker> well , we have sin one curve , <vocalsound> a design . Rubber design . And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . So just half a Euro for <gap> <disfmarker> You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , Hmm . which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . So , Hmm . easy . What do we scrap . Well I d think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . Yeah . I'd say that too . Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . Hmm . There are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . I think it's also harder to <disfmarker> Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , Yeah . which you can't do with a normal remote control , Hmm . which people already do . <gap> . So I ju So <disfmarker> I took that out . So <disfmarker> and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . And , yeah , I didn't see anything else I could take out . Yeah , Pushbut I could take out the push-buttons , but we need those . Huh . <vocalsound> So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition Special colour , yeah . <vocalsound> and the separate covers can account for the <disfmarker> if people want it , we'll just <disfmarker> then we'll do it in black . We'll just deliver it in black , have the <disfmarker> it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it <disfmarker> if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . You make it d orange or whatever you want . Well , I'd <disfmarker> I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . It was a big issue , but <disfmarker> So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? I'll just go back . Uh let's just <disfmarker> let's see what <disfmarker> okay , let's just see what we <disfmarker> no , we we have to be under twelve and a half . Yeah , it <disfmarker> It <disfmarker> it's not <disfmarker> The p uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , Okay , but there's another problem . And the p Okay . so . But there's another problem . What <disfmarker> If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously . I think you <disfmarker> that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . Huh . Huh . Yeah . So I think <disfmarker> yeah , it's <disfmarker> I think it's y one of the <disfmarker> it's a good way to um to help people uh to make <disfmarker> to keep the product trendy too . Hmm . Hmm . Just keep <disfmarker> you just make new covers for the <disfmarker> for it , Right . like we agreed before . I agree . And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . Yeah . We do . Mm-hmm . Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . B yeah , but those go together . And yeah , we could take out the curve . Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic . We could take out a curve indeed . Could <disfmarker> we could take out the curve . Is that an option ? <gap> . Yes . For you ? Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . But uh the <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , But <disfmarker> Yeah . because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . I think it's <disfmarker> it it does ruin it , The people <disfmarker> but the fact that I t took that decision or t Yeah . Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um <vocalsound> the possibility of adding your own custom covers . So you can change <gap> any colour you want . So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . Can we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover You can take plastic , and <disfmarker> but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that <disfmarker> something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of <disfmarker> the spongy feeling of the <disfmarker> Spongy , yeah . We can put those to the to the other covers . Yeah . and it really makes it <disfmarker> also makes it different from the existing remote controls , And <disfmarker> because they're all plastic . That's true . So which in in turn <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Rubber would increase durability But <disfmarker> okay . because it doesn't break . But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? Because we have to lose two things and <disfmarker> I guess . I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes . which would make this black a black and grey . Okay , and that's enough ? Yeah , that's that that that's enough , So black and grey is okay . because I guess those are the basic colours . But <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Oh . Hmm . <vocalsound> Which we can fabricate , okay . The people want to pay for for it , I think those are basic col They want to <disfmarker> so why why uh <vocalsound> do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ? To ensure the profit . That <disfmarker> that's th that's the order . We're just uh <disfmarker> we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company Yeah . which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . But we can take a risk . But that's not for our <disfmarker> that's not our decision to take . No , we basically <disfmarker> We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . Okay , yeah . Hmm . We need to stick to that . So <disfmarker> Stick that . I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of <disfmarker> or the backup design thing I hope the people will like it , but <disfmarker> to have <disfmarker> I think they would do . Th I think they do like because yo we <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , <gap> <disfmarker> because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , Yeah . one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect Perhaps we should make m Yeah . <vocalsound> Huh . and keep the functionality between <disfmarker> of <disfmarker> within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . The first sheet . So <disfmarker> Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . And that's <disfmarker> uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . <vocalsound> Well I don't think <disfmarker> Yeah . Perhaps they decide tha Is it worth <disfmarker> is it is it <disfmarker> But they don't <disfmarker> does it mean anything to the customer ? Like , it <disfmarker> like , we don't care <disfmarker> we don't care that you had to <disfmarker> Of course . Perhaps <gap> they uh <disfmarker> no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's <disfmarker> that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs . We ca we uh we can at least tell them that <disfmarker> True , but we did we didn't get that . So I think it's <disfmarker> You don't know that . it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . Well <disfmarker> Huh . No , I'm not uh talking about that cost <gap> But <disfmarker> but the one that g has given us the order to design this . We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , They could , but uh <disfmarker> and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an <disfmarker> still an option , but <vocalsound> not for this price . It's an option , but <disfmarker> yeah , it's true . So actually uh it's not that much of an increase , but yeah . And if we <disfmarker> We cannot contact them . It's just the order that we got . Exactly , Yeah . but <disfmarker> So that's what we gotta go with . So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either <vocalsound> turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , Yeah . Hmm . um or turn it yellow . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's uh something we have to decide on . I'd say lose the curve and the colour I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , and <disfmarker> we could lose the c yeah , I forgot that , sorry . Uh the curve . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So which curve is that ba that's basically that curve . That's just this one just d this is the banana curve . Hmm . Yeah , that's better . So this would this would be straight . So we could u still have the comfort . No , uh <disfmarker> no , that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like <vocalsound> like that . Hmm . Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . <gap> we could make it yellow then , I second that . but <disfmarker> You second that , you second that we lose the curve . <vocalsound> No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . Okay , yeah . So that's not really that <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve <vocalsound> to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . Hmm . So we keep the curve . So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . I would <disfmarker> And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has . <vocalsound> Oh . I agree . Yeah . I would say <disfmarker> I would agree with you on the colour , No . Yep . because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . Mm-hmm . So we can always do that . Yeah , um I guess people are willing to pay for that . So I think we can take that option and just <disfmarker> with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . Yeah . Hmm ? <vocalsound> So I think that would still make it a nice product . Yes . Okay , we're final on that . So <vocalsound> it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . But anyways we're here . Um yeah . Which is basically what we discussed . This we discussed just now . That's just now <disfmarker> just <disfmarker> we could just discuss how the project went . I mean , was kind of <disfmarker> And I want to do that . I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you <disfmarker> yeah , everything cannot be for free . We didn't <disfmarker> I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . Because that was <disfmarker> I th Yes , Huh . we could have <disfmarker> it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . Hmm . So we just put something <disfmarker> Yeah . I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , <vocalsound> Yeah . because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , Yeah , I think <gap> <disfmarker> would have been . Yeah . and then I d had not list of available c finances . But <disfmarker> Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that . So <disfmarker> So I suppose <disfmarker> Let's um <vocalsound> see <gap> um <disfmarker> Yeah , let's see if it sells . I mean I suppose this sells , Um <disfmarker> because it's very <disfmarker> <vocalsound> very extended . But <disfmarker> Well I hope it sells . <vocalsound> Let's <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Hmm . I suppose it sells , because it's good . Oh . I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway . Hmm . <vocalsound> Hmm . Okay , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . Um I have some <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh a method , a requirements and scale of . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what <disfmarker> if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not . Okay . <vocalsound> Have been met , okay . And I will uh make a new blank sheet <vocalsound> Yeah . So so the buttons , the look and feel . I thought it was okay , but the advanced uh settings , um screen , audio and channel <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Which are basically accessible through the menu button . They're stuck under menu . We are not <disfmarker> For the menu . Hmm . I think those are totally met , because we we really took them for the <disfmarker> they have the feel they want , Oh the menu button is it . Yeah . Hi Oh , okay . they have the simplicity they want . Then it's all uh <disfmarker> S I think it's very uh very well met . Either two or one maybe . One . it's true . I think we took that <disfmarker> everything they wanted into consideration . Yeah . So it could either be a two or a one . So d Oh wait . Uh pen . One and a half . <vocalsound> Which is not an option . <vocalsound> The p Oh yeah , it's red , Just create our own option . <vocalsound> okay , but <disfmarker> Look and feel is everybo it's true . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Anyone ? And the next one <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it . It's perfect . Even for deaf people , It's <disfmarker> yeah . Hmm . It's <disfmarker> I don't think it's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back . To make it that way , yeah . Because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . Maybe you can hear it . But I mean we tried , Yeah . so I think it <disfmarker> that's <disfmarker> that deserves a one . Definitely . And it's and it's <disfmarker> yeah . To <gap> . That's okay then . And the next one . How is that ? Uh w we had <disfmarker> we don't have an uh manual , Manual . yeah . <vocalsound> But I think that's a part of it . I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , But <disfmarker> I'd use an <gap> remote control . Mm yeah . but then again , it's for young people . So <disfmarker> Yeah , an L_C_D_ , it tells a lot about uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I th And it's pretty straight-forward , you have a navigation <disfmarker> no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . Exactly . It's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh . No , that's true . I think it won't be a big problem . Yeah . So <disfmarker> So it's a one or a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> One I d no , I don't know . actu I think <disfmarker> but we didn't even <disfmarker> For the advanced uh settings . there was no issue on making a manual actually . We didn't <disfmarker> <gap> really discuss it , No okay , that <disfmarker> uh that's true . but I don't think it takes <disfmarker> no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , I think . We took it s it's so easy , No , Oh , it it is pretty straight-forward . so it <disfmarker> we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really . So I think that's <disfmarker> Ah . Um <disfmarker> yeah , we didn't <disfmarker> it's either two or one , I guess . Takes no ti Maybe it's a two , because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is <disfmarker> there are some option hidden under the menu button . With the more important functions on . Yeah . So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess . Yeah . Yeah . And the L_C_D_ , you have to see it . So just make that a two . Um mm <disfmarker> Oh , it's a little bit learning . Okay . Uh yeah <vocalsound> it's uh a little bit same . But it tells you or not ? Mm-hmm . You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . I think so . I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . I think so . But wha w Mm-hmm . oh , yeah . What are we uh displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Just uh only the channels and <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> <gap> the menus uh <disfmarker> What uh ? Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those . Well , basically the menu options indeed . But <disfmarker> Oh , in the L_C_D_ screen . No , y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . What does it display ? Yes . And for a channel selection , uh <gap> <disfmarker> or that's not <disfmarker> Well I thought it was I thought it was <disfmarker> I thought that people wanted previews on their <disfmarker> I'm not sure if that even possible , Yeah , I thought I thought too but <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> yeah . 'cause it's <disfmarker> this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . I don't think it's possible really . But the <disfmarker> they didn't really define in what should be used for . Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh <disfmarker> No . But I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's <disfmarker> that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes . Mm . Yeah . Yeah , it must be clear then what <disfmarker> what what for we use it . But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your <disfmarker> uh with configuring your remote control for favourite <disfmarker> your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . Yeah . Yeah . So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . I think it's good . No , maybe it's not a one because it's <disfmarker> we're not using it perfectly . We didn't give it <disfmarker> I don't thing over-discussing . Now we gave it enough thought though . Yeah . I think we d should just lower this . Maybe maybe it's a three though . We could've used it more effectively probably . Yeah , indeed . <vocalsound> So everybody's agree with an uh three on it , it's <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . Two or three . Yeah , we are using it , W but it's not Yeah . So <disfmarker> it's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , I think . We could have ev even lost <vocalsound> the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection . Yeah . It's <disfmarker> now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features , Yeah , <gap> I <disfmarker> but okay . A three . Nah , it's not really <disfmarker> only an extra . You can <disfmarker> seven . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Ah , nothing , that's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> A seven . Uh that's uh <disfmarker> No menus . Think about <disfmarker> Can you talk to remote control ? Or we could say it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , it can't talk anymore . Yeah . <vocalsound> So we scrap that . Or we could say neutral , we <disfmarker> 'cause we scratched the <disfmarker> Oh yeah <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Just to be a prick , C but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . <gap> Yeah yeah yeah yeah . But you c <vocalsound> you can talk to it . Not with the speech recognition . Uh yeah , all the trends and no colours uh anymore . So <disfmarker> Well , we did take everything into consideration of course . Uh the shape i shape is i Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> uh um only in the curves . I think we <disfmarker> yeah , I think that's okay . But the colours , we don't have special colours on it . No , we don't have the colour . Yeah , So I <disfmarker> <gap> special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable Yeah , but we <vocalsound> <disfmarker> to the fashi Yes , but the end product <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> yeah , Hmm . we don't have it , so d We don't have it <disfmarker> we do have it , In the end product . it's just sold as a package . But <disfmarker> M It does <disfmarker> it's not part of the basic product . Changing covers is also trend that we followed . It <disfmarker> that that's what I call trendy . <vocalsound> I mean the shape is trendy . The the sh the the functions are trendy . It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . Now <disfmarker> Because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment . But it's not a one . Maybe we should go with a two then , because it's not perfect , Yeah . because we can't do it initially , but we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . It's possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour . Oh well <disfmarker> Oops . <vocalsound> Oh it's a two , right ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . On the last one . Uh that n that's all . Overall score . Overall score . <vocalsound> Overall . <vocalsound> It's um One two three . <gap> sixteen . <vocalsound> ten , sixteen three <disfmarker> uh two <vocalsound> Two two point some two point something . two point seven or something like that . Hmm . I don't know why . Ten , sixteen , divided by <disfmarker> <gap> . Six . Six . Is two two third . Two and two thirds . Um <disfmarker> So we can say it's it's <disfmarker> the product is <disfmarker> it's okay . <vocalsound> It's okay , Y not <disfmarker> but <vocalsound> that's yo m Mm-hmm . mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . There's <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . 'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average . Yeah . Without that it would be like under <disfmarker> it wouldn't <disfmarker> yeah , it would be under two . So I think we have <disfmarker> even with this it's reasonable . Woah . <vocalsound> Yeah , if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that it's really not well implemented . We come out on a average of two one eighth . Yeah . Well I think it's <disfmarker> two is okay . So which is pretty w good . Mm-hmm . Yeah , two is pretty good . It's at least on the positive side . So <disfmarker> Hmm , of course . Definitely . We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources , Yeah . but <disfmarker> Yeah , I think it's probably <disfmarker> <gap> I Mm-hmm . Yeah . I do admit that we d <vocalsound> did miss a little <disfmarker> or didn't sp didn't talk <gap> <disfmarker> talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . We could have used it more efficiently , Yeah . we just didn't think of it that way . Yeah . Yeah , <vocalsound> with <gap> . True . So <gap> <disfmarker> like I said , <vocalsound> changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . The scale . But I think for this price , this is <disfmarker> it's really a reasonable product . I think we div I think we did very well , It's a good product . uh ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . Yeah . With an L_C_D_ screen <gap> . Oh . Oh . Yeah . It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . So . <disfmarker> But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this . <vocalsound> They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel . <vocalsound> Yeah , you can make 'em another one . <vocalsound> Hmm yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that . I don' think so . You cannot th think of that <gap> <disfmarker> Uh it's just not <disfmarker> it it's not affordable . No , it's not . Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably , but I think that's <disfmarker> I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition . Mm-hmm . Oh It's also more attractive . Definitely . Okay , that was that . Yeah . Yeah . So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . So did you <disfmarker> Let's see , what was left in the the <disfmarker> Another one . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> we evaluate the product . <gap> <disfmarker> General project , what's i in <disfmarker> For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere . Hmm . Favourite channel . Well <disfmarker> Anyways . Yeah , leadership is up to you . I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d <vocalsound> put a put a speech recognition into it . But that's not for me to decide . Yeah , I know . Yeah . I think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , Yes . Hmm . because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you . Hmm . Yeah , you're working separate . Yeah . Say , look , this is <disfmarker> you're doing the wrong thing , Yeah . Huh . you're s you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford . Yeah . Yeah , yeah yeah . Hmm . So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh <disfmarker> Hmm . Yeah yeah yeah . Direct uh communication with <disfmarker> yeah . And we could share information which we received . because that's that's what would w you <disfmarker> what you would normally do , either call or email someone . So that was too bad Hmm . con was impossible here anyways . <gap> . That's the same thing that I had in the beginning . Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have . So <disfmarker> It didn't have Yeah . or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . Oh . There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . Yeah . Hmm . So that was a little unclear I suppose . I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little <disfmarker> it's easier to share them . <vocalsound> My handwriting is little bit <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Hmm . Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , It's a little less <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> the response time is le it's very bad . Hmm . because <disfmarker> It's good to visualise everything , but I think the response time should <disfmarker> could be a lot better . The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . But th that's <disfmarker> Definitely . Mm-hmm . Yeah , it's true . Yeah , okay . So <disfmarker> But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed . Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n No , you don't have to . No , you don't . No . I jin You can <disfmarker> Oh . I didn't check the finish button . I just <disfmarker> you just ditch it Done and then it's okay . and you can copy it or whatever . Okay , I saw that uh <disfmarker> Uh only if you uh check the notes or <vocalsound> press done . Then it um <disfmarker> then you can <disfmarker> then it exports to Word automatically . Hmm . But it's not necessary to check either one of those two . You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme . Yeah , but I made <disfmarker> Oh , okay . Okay , Okay , yeah . but I made three pages and they were not finished . And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further . <gap> <disfmarker> Okay , before starting a ne a new page . Okay . Okay , that could be b . Exactly . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . Oh . Hmm . You have to finish it completely , Okay . Oh can you ? Okay . then download it , it's <disfmarker> then start a new one . Yeah , okay . That's not very uh handy , but if you know that , then it's not a problem . That's <disfmarker> Yeah , it's understandable , okay . <vocalsound> Any new ideas ? Yeah , more communication between <vocalsound> between uh <disfmarker> that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very um very important , <vocalsound> Important to mm <disfmarker> because if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making <disfmarker> doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , Yeah . you have limitation both on the technical <gap> <disfmarker> on the d on the design side . So I think that could have been better . But that's <disfmarker> I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh <gap> than somewhere else . Hmm . So <disfmarker> Yeah , well it could also possibly be <disfmarker> well , is it a more real-time information base , so we can all see <vocalsound> which information is available to one another . Yeah , I think so . And l less p less spam probably . I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well , Mm-hmm . but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a <disfmarker> there was another email about master classes or something . Ah . Well <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Hmm . which were totally useless actually . I thought I should probably look into them , <vocalsound> but they were all useless . So I just <disfmarker> Well , I personally did not have that , Mm <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> Oh okay . That's probably your l description . <vocalsound> But I also didn't <disfmarker> not really . But still , you had that as well . Huh . Is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information . Yeah . Yeah , after <disfmarker> After five minutes , uh <disfmarker> <gap> . Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> There was a little delay in the <disfmarker> <gap> bit of a c crucial delay . Yeah . I didn't have any uh more information , it's just always the same here . Mm . So that's that's kind of a <disfmarker> Email uh <disfmarker> It would change , but not for me . So I'd <disfmarker> I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . Hmm . Hmm . I couldn't do any research myself or <disfmarker> I see , that's <disfmarker> Hmm . yeah , w I could have done a little extra work probably , then <disfmarker> <gap> it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But I was busy enough anyway . So <disfmarker> Hmm . <vocalsound> Yeah . Any new ideas found ? Or is that a <gap> 'cause <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No . uh yeah , it's <disfmarker> well , probably is . How much time do we have for this anyway ? I have no clue . That's like <disfmarker> oh,but it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> bring out the beer . Champagne . Uh okay , I want one for my own . <vocalsound> think that's about it . Uh <disfmarker> I'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what <disfmarker> all your tasks were finished , right ? Yeah . What you ha from your assistant . So let's <disfmarker> I have no more email . My coach is uh being very silent now . Yeah , Okay , my personal coach i I should <disfmarker> I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up . I think we took very little time now , because <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , we're in agreement , everything <disfmarker> the design is okay . The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name . What <disfmarker> No , How about you cook a <disfmarker> how about you cook up a product name ? we haven't think above <disfmarker> about that . Product name . <vocalsound> Yeah , name . Huh . It's better than thi I think than a serial number . Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me . Uh <disfmarker> Or fruit name . Just <disfmarker> oh , think of a catchy name . I'll be working on this until the beep <disfmarker> until it beeps . So <disfmarker> Like fruit names . Fruit name or something like that . The banana remote or something . What ? Fruit ? You don't want it to resemble a banana . <vocalsound> I don't know . Yeah , it's the form of it . The bana It's not yellow anyway . 'cause it's not yellow anymore . Yeah <disfmarker> oh , yeah . <gap> <disfmarker> It's not yellow anymore . It is curved , but <disfmarker> Uh yeah . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Well , uh I was going for the R_C_ deluxe , but it's not really a catchy name or anything , it's more <disfmarker> No , it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh at least it's not something with numbers . Hmm . Numbers are so meaningless to the people . Yeah . I mean <disfmarker> Something with our <gap> company name , That's true . can we do anything with that ? <vocalsound> <gap> . Reaction , Real Reaction . Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out . <vocalsound> Real Reaction . The reaction deluxe . Real Reaction future R_C_ . <vocalsound> Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is that a name or a c campaign ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No that's a that's a catchy slogan . Yeah . <vocalsound> Or the <disfmarker> Control your remote control . The real reactor . Real react . I go for future R_C_ probably . Something like <disfmarker> It's short f The Real Reactor , I don't find that uh that bad at all . <gap> . Real reactor ? Yeah . You should write it down as a <disfmarker> an option . Because our name is Real Reaction . Uh that that's <vocalsound> <gap> . That makes me think of different <vocalsound> products than a remote control really . <vocalsound> I'm not sure . Real reaction in a real <disfmarker> Zapping . The <disfmarker> So that's one option . Real reactor . Didn't notice . I'm looking for things in the name . Mm . So that the first three letters are s the same . R_E_A_ R_E_A_ . Should I write the banana down or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , sure . I take f yeah , Sure ? take a banana . <vocalsound> The banana . Hmm . Remote . Banana recei R_C_ . The triple R_ . Real Reaction remotes control . Triple R_ . Remote . Well I <disfmarker> R_ three C_ . Uh do you mean it like <disfmarker> <gap> ? R_ three C_ . <gap> yeah . You mean it like this ? Yeah , that <disfmarker> Real Reaction Remote Control . R_ three C_ . Oh yeah . <gap> . <gap> . No , not like that . It should be it should be longer , because it's not a product name that you f print on a box . I think <disfmarker> triple R_ . Doesn't sound <gap> ? Just write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe <disfmarker> Oh . Triple dash R_ dash s s C_ . Yeah , triple R_ . Yeah . Triple R_C_ . Ah . The triple R_C_ , yeah . Yeah . R_ s R_ three C_ . <gap> . <vocalsound> R_ dash C_ . Dash C_ ? I think I like it like this more . Dash . Triple R_ or triple R_C_ ? Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_ ? Triple R_ dash . How about do both ? <vocalsound> Sure if it looks stupid . Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of <disfmarker> it's a triple <disfmarker> Hmm . Uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control , Mm . That <disfmarker> but it's only a single remote control . And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote . <vocalsound> Yeah , I would <disfmarker> huh . I would lose the C_ this <disfmarker> yeah . and just name it triple R_ . Is it triple R_C_s ? No . <gap> <disfmarker> It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it . Triple remote . I would just say triple R_s triple R_ Yeah . Yeah , triple R_ <gap> yeah , you can <disfmarker> Well , that's another option . That's also short , catchy . It's okay . <vocalsound> Yeah , triple R_ . Okay , so which ones are we going to scratch definitely ? <vocalsound> The banana . <vocalsound> Banana . <vocalsound> Banana . <vocalsound> Banana remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I say this one as well . Yeah , the deluxe . <gap> . I think we're all in agreement about the triple R_ . I think triple R_ is cool . Yes . The r triple R_ . Triple R_ ? Triple R_ it is . And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool . Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> did you do now ? Just like this <gap> just <disfmarker> and you just print triple R_ , Yeah . it looks <disfmarker> doesn't look bad , it's short , it's okay . Yeah . So have to write my report now , I guess . Um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Yeah , so we have everything . We have the product , we have the costs , Yep . we have the possibility of everything . It can't work . That will not <disfmarker> Okay . I think it's adjourned . Retire to my lair and finish the report . That was a short meeting . But efficient though . Mm-hmm . The boss is always the last one to go home . So <disfmarker> Probably . <vocalsound> See . Okay , Okay . goodbye . See you in a minute . Damn . I will write that one in a Word uh document . Okay . Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? Yeah , sure . <vocalsound> Can't we take this one ? Oh sh Otherwise we have to do it all over again . Um <disfmarker> I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no . Is it okay if I try ? Is that okay with you ? Sure . Yeah , okay , I will ask you when uh I need the information . I'll put it back in a minute . So it's <disfmarker> oh . Okay , it has been saving something , but where to I don't know . Uh <disfmarker> Oh . Merge . Oh , can I say exp yes , I can . Sucks . Export as J_ PEG . <gap> . Okay , can I not put this wherever I wants . My document is the wrong one , huh . <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah , but <disfmarker> Network places . I don't know . Smart <disfmarker> no . <gap> . Ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest . <vocalsound> I don't think so . That one is . <gap> . Document and settings . I wouldn't pick that one , no . <vocalsound> That's a pity . That means that we have to gonna draw it again . Are you gonna do that ? Sure . Okay . Oh . That <disfmarker> Yes . Okay . Okay . Okay . Yes , that's correct . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . No . Oh , it's export . Oh yeah , <gap> . <gap> <disfmarker> Okay . Can I see scores ? Uh , <gap> one one , two threes , two <disfmarker> Oh , of course . Sorry . Okay , then we'll <disfmarker> overall , two points . Yes . I see you later . Yeah . <vocalsound> Mm .
<vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm uh . <vocalsound> <gap> We're the first . Mm . We're the first ones . <vocalsound> Marketing Expert , yes . Mm . <vocalsound> So you found your spots . Yes . <vocalsound> Move to the meeting room . <vocalsound> Bling bling . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Right . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh <vocalsound> where has my screen gone ? Hi . Hello , good day . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh yeah , Hmm . we have to talk in English , huh . Yep . Yeah . My screen is gone . <vocalsound> Oh . It's called black . <vocalsound> Kick-off meeting , wow . I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh . It's uh looks uh nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm ? Okay . I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . <vocalsound> I don't know how much preparation you guys did , Yeah . but not a lot . Yeah . No , it's <disfmarker> it was uh not enough . You see this beautiful presentation . Yeah . Very nice . Okay let's get started . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh I sort of prepared this . Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . Mm . Mm-hmm . Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . So , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> hope you have good ideas . I don't . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I did my best . Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , Not yet . then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that . Yeah . Uh well you know how to <disfmarker> the documents work . So <disfmarker> Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Operations . Yes . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It doesn't always work . Yes . Yeah . Okay so you can draw . Draw . Alright . Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . 'Kay . Okay ? Uh <disfmarker> Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal . Uh you should explain <disfmarker> Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Don't take up too much space . <vocalsound> So , Julian . Um yeah . Different pen widths , how do you do that ? <vocalsound> Uh with the format menu . Oh okay . And use different colours etcetera . <vocalsound> It's a giraffe . Yeah . Are you serious ? And <vocalsound> what's that supposed to be ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Should it be one <disfmarker> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Oh yeah <vocalsound> Okay . four legs . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> Giraffe's yellow . <vocalsound> Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh <disfmarker> Oh format . Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or Yeah . so y you must save it at the end and then <disfmarker> Yeah you can press the next button , which is uh <disfmarker> yeah . That's some spots . I'll show you . I in the file option menu . Yeah . In file menu . Okay , then m make a new one . No . How much time do we have to draw anyway ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . 'Cause I can take forever on this . <vocalsound> <gap> Okay . Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ? Yeah . <vocalsound> I think it's a it's a great animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What is it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a it's a giraffe . A giraffe okay . Yeah , Yeah that's a <disfmarker> I see a long neck but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's more like a dinosaur . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye . Okay . <vocalsound> Uh . That's nice of you . Hey . Come on . Some leaf to eat . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah pretty good . Uh could you press the next uh <disfmarker> The next ? Yes . Okay . Then uh <disfmarker> <gap> . Yeah . Here you go . <vocalsound> Thanks . Hmm . Yeah . <vocalsound> Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ? Yeah sorry , <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> introduction and get acquainted and <disfmarker> Alright . That's the idea , so <disfmarker> Uh . Your line broke . <vocalsound> Yeah . Alright . <vocalsound> It's not that fast . Yeah it's a bit slow , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I see . It misses the spot . <gap> pressure . I'm guessing a turtle . No . <vocalsound> I'm kidding . <vocalsound> I say good guess . Uh <disfmarker> Why a turtle ? Because of its shell . Because it's slow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's slow . 'Cause it's so 'cause it's green . <vocalsound> You were slow too so <disfmarker> Yeah I was a bit slow too . Dude you're a good drawer . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh some other line uh width uh <disfmarker> Do you have a turtle pet ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> Uh okay . I dunno . <vocalsound> Does it have legs ? <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah sure . Yeah ? Yeah not exactly legs but <disfmarker> More like fins <vocalsound> Stumpy stuff . or <disfmarker> It's more like a tank . Yeah that's fins but I don't know where . They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on . <vocalsound> Yeah . Some spots . Ah some eye . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah it's l looks very friendly . <vocalsound> Yeah that's a fr <vocalsound> friendly turtle I guess . <vocalsound> Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough . Yeah okay . A little tail maybe . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . <vocalsound> I don't know what the position is . <vocalsound> Does it have ears ? Uh no . No . No . Oh okay . No . The little holes maybe . Can you erase ears or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah ? There's a a gum , Alright . gum to <gap> . Eraser . And why did you choose this animal ? So <disfmarker> He said it was slow . I dunno . I it just came into my mind . So there's no particular reason Alright . I <gap> pen . <vocalsound> I like it . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well I'm <disfmarker> guess I'm done . Okay . <gap> That's my turtle . Your turn Niels . Alright . How to select the next or <disfmarker> The next here . yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> Colours were under format Here you go . Makes new paper . right ? Yeah . Let's see . Orange . How am I gonna do this ? Um <disfmarker> Mm uh . A rabbit I think . Kangaroo . <vocalsound> Not quite actually . Kangaroo . <vocalsound> Fox . A fox yeah . Firefox . Dog . <vocalsound> No . Cat . Aye . <vocalsound> It's a cat . It's a cat . Mm . Not quite yet through . A cat who had an accident or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Why a cat ? Uh yeah I dunno . They're my favourite pets . You have some uh ? Uh I have colour already . Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st <vocalsound> The pen , Oh shit . Um <disfmarker> yeah . Excuse my language . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sure . <vocalsound> I don't know how to draw its face . But you get the idea . It's a cat . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright . It's my favourite uh pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . <vocalsound> Okay . That's it . Or do I need to use more colours Yeah . and <disfmarker> <gap> I think it's okay . Alright . You get idea Yeah . right ? Okay um <vocalsound> we have a financial aspect to this project . <vocalsound> Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh the aim is to reach <disfmarker> uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money . And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . So we have to s Okay now it's time for some discussion . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> Okay . Uh <disfmarker> What uh what uh do you want to discuss ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . We should get started . Yeah . Yep . Uh I'm taking notes . Um Okay . Great . we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . Mm-hmm . I didn't know if you received the same mail . Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . I guess so . Yeah . Okay so the um <vocalsound> uh <gap> this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ? True . Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . Right ? Yeah ? Yep . <vocalsound> And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . Yeah . Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So I had to uh , <vocalsound> I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , Mm-hmm . and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . Mm-hmm . And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . Mm-hmm . How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points . Uh <vocalsound> according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . And that's basically all I have so far . Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . Yeah . Wireless uh <disfmarker> huh . Yeah . Yeah . Alright . Yeah . So that's very common . Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the <disfmarker> to all the channels and changing the volume . That are the the basic options for a remote control . Yeah . Yeah I kept it global 'cause <vocalsound> <disfmarker> that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . Okay , yeah . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel Yeah . but you might wanna use teletext also . Yep . Yeah . I dunno what the word is in English . Uh <gap> <disfmarker> Same I believe <gap> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ? Uh well from a marketing uh <vocalsound> perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . Mm-hmm . Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research <vocalsound> uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . Mm-hmm . I mean , what functions do they have . Mm . Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? Yep . Yes . So we can see uh what needs to be supported . Um <vocalsound> and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , Okay . Okay . uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , Mm-hmm . and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . Okay . And you can get that information ? I think I can get that information , yeah . Okay . That would be very handy . So <disfmarker> yeah . Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? No n not specifically . More to how to get them No ? <vocalsound> I got some uh requirements and <disfmarker> No okay . it has uh <gap> it has to be user-friendly . Yeah ? Yeah ? <vocalsound> Of course . Yeah . Yeah . Obviously . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh <disfmarker> yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine . Big , mm-hmm . Yeah . Uh and a and a good uh zapping range . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh what do you mean by that ? Yeah . Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . Yeah . It has to be capable for zapping uh <disfmarker> From the other end of the room or something ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay um <disfmarker> Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . Um I think the best is to go to work . Whoa . Is that you or <disfmarker> Yeah . alright . Okay . Any more points to discuss ? Yeah . I think we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email . Alright . So <vocalsound> Alright . Okay . that was it for me . 'Kay . Thanks . Uh <disfmarker> Are you going to put the the notes on the <disfmarker> Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . Yeah . The pro okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Alright . I'm writing very fast . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Hope it's readable . Uh . Yep . Okay <vocalsound> I guess so . um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh session ? Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? Yeah . Because then we have a <disfmarker> After that we are going to the conceptual uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . We're just working the three phases . Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare <disfmarker> uh I have to defend our design , <vocalsound> so make it good . <vocalsound> Yeah okay . We'll do our best . Okay . Okay . I depend on you . <vocalsound> Better make it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Do we <disfmarker> I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> That is my question also Yeah . because like new new functions <disfmarker> Well I think that is the user requirements part . Requirements . Yeah . As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small <disfmarker> Yeah . True . Yeah . But but we need good communication about this stuff , Unit . Yeah . 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I would first m So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . Yeah well I I was <disfmarker> Yeah I understand . Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions Yeah and we can uh expand them . well You can always add a few <disfmarker> like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . Yeah . So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . Hmm , the C_D_ player . Yeah . Yeah . And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . Yeah so <disfmarker> And then use your Windows media centre <vocalsound> under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch <gap> Yeah . Okay . Yeah I I know what you mean , Okay . but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . S You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . Mm-hmm . Yeah records and stuff like that . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . Okay . No . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , You need additional <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . so I kind of need to know what we uh need . Yeah . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh in here Yeah . and then we can discuss it with the next uh meeting . In the project uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . Okay . So we have a basic starting point Okay . and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah . Yeah Yeah . Alright . it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . So it's hasn't <gap> <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Th the least amount of functions possible Yeah . so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . I understand . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ? Okay Alright . Yes . and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , you're di dismissed . Can we leave now Half an hour . or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thanks . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You're fired . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Not yet . No . Mm . Alright . <vocalsound> Okay . Alright let's move on . Let's see what we got to do . Yeah . <vocalsound> See you later . Yeah see you later . Okay . Yeah . Good luck . <vocalsound> Yeah . Thank you . Well good luck . <vocalsound> What the <disfmarker>
Welcome back . Hello . Hello . Uh let me see . There's one of mine . Okay . Roo , welcome back . Hello , Flores . The waiting is for Sebastian . <vocalsound> <gap> . There he is . <vocalsound> Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? We have a slight problem . <vocalsound> I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys . Sorry ? <vocalsound> Can I get a cup of coffee ? Uh no . You can't , Okay . <vocalsound> sorry . So just cancel it . <gap> Well , during my work I have no time either . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , this is life . <vocalsound> Sorry uh , Roo . Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . <vocalsound> Accidentally . Okay . Okay . But it's alright . People , welcome back with the second meeting . <vocalsound> Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it . Mm-hmm . Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ? I think so too . Roo ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Ruud ? Almost . <vocalsound> Almost , okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . <vocalsound> Um we will figure that out . Okay . Ca <vocalsound> can you try to <disfmarker> Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the <gap> . Yeah , w we will see . I don't think it's wireless here . Um <disfmarker> it is , yeah . Yeah . It is . Or it is . It is . Yeah ? Okay , great . Uh okay . Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um <vocalsound> we have forty minutes . So it's now <disfmarker> Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product . <vocalsound> It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w Yeah . uh uh <disfmarker> we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . Time , yeah . Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , <vocalsound> which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um <vocalsound> then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product . Yes . Is that clear ? Any questions on these requirements ? No ? <vocalsound> Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? Yeah , I'll start . Uh uh yeah . Okay , Yes . great . Um <disfmarker> Oh , how can I uh <disfmarker> Geez , and sli and show . Um <disfmarker> Just uh press it . <vocalsound> Uh yes . Alright . Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . <vocalsound> Uh the method of the remote control is just <disfmarker> the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . So that was the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . Yeah . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . Mm-hmm . And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons . Yeah . <vocalsound> Um but um <disfmarker> yeah . My personal preferences were ease of uh <disfmarker> the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh <disfmarker> it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than <disfmarker> less than forty years old . Uh-huh . So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my <disfmarker> in <gap> my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us . Okay . Uh Ruud , did you get that ? Yeah , uh b uh most . Yeah . Okay , so <vocalsound> the important thing here is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . Oh , user-friendly . In the market , Yeah , yeah . what what does the market want ? I I don't know . Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh <disfmarker> Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control . Yeah . Okay . Sebastian . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Excuse me . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Scusi . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Okay , it's still the right thing . Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . <vocalsound> And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , but it's hardly readable . Energies and uh <disfmarker> Can you see it ? No , it's not visible . No ? Well <disfmarker> Um , there's a energy source here . <vocalsound> And um basically there <disfmarker> it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . <vocalsound> Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . <vocalsound> It's almost every piece of equipment um every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . Yeah . There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed . yes . In the <disfmarker> and it's a little more <disfmarker> a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . <vocalsound> So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . There's nothing more to it . So it's fairly easy . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before , <vocalsound> Succeed in it also . <vocalsound> Okay . and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . <vocalsound> Okay , So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , so uh good . personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear . Okay . Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them . <vocalsound> Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . Okay . And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . <vocalsound> And what's the um <disfmarker> I think our uh users will really uh will really like that . if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or <disfmarker> No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . Okay . So we can use them . So that's no problem . For the same costs , Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , it's can be uh in our <disfmarker> but by uh um um making <disfmarker> Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh <disfmarker> We can we can make its I think . Well you could only lit uh the buttons <disfmarker> the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching . Yeah . Yeah . Or <disfmarker> Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . Okay . But I think <disfmarker> Hmm . Hmm , true . Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , <vocalsound> and not for <disfmarker> Yes . Well , it's not one light , it <disfmarker> there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think . No no no , no . That's right , that's right . Okay . So <disfmarker> well , this uh should be it . Okay . <vocalsound> Um have a think about it . Yeah . Okay , Oh , mine is already outdated . Ruud . <vocalsound> Okay well , <vocalsound> Since uh <disfmarker> we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product . <vocalsound> So any income is welcome . <vocalsound> Input . Okay , make <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units . Of <gap> <disfmarker> of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million . Could you step a little bit more to the right ? <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , thank you . <vocalsound> I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea . <vocalsound> Uh well , skip this . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , it's <disfmarker> this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the <disfmarker> about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . Mm . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them . Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Okay . Or <disfmarker> Well , that's interesting . Or a find <disfmarker> a finding function , Yeah . Yeah , you know . That's quite a <disfmarker> that's definitely interesting . yes . It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Sound signal . Yeah . Yeah . Okay , Yes . go on . Well , I just said that . And uh <disfmarker> well , this obvious , and he also said it . Okay . So that's what the market tells us . Uh that's about it , yes . Yep . Okay . The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . Uh mo uh zap buttons most . So <disfmarker> Volume , they are <gap> uh use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So <disfmarker> Yeah , well it should just have a design <disfmarker> The perfect design for those <disfmarker> only those buttons . Yes . And first um <disfmarker> Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . Yeah . Yep . Well , the technical uh <disfmarker> there <disfmarker> I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal . Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , <vocalsound> the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? Yeah , that's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a problem . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well Yes . <vocalsound> Th that's a bit of <disfmarker> that's a problem . <vocalsound> Another device is not a solution . Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , Usually <disfmarker> It should be uh uh <disfmarker> like um turning on and off the the the lights . Oh yes . Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it . Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep . Reports rep respend response to it . And um <disfmarker> Yeah , just like uh the phones Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing . the <disfmarker> Yeah . But uh th But but T_V_s don't have all uh uh buttons . Uh <disfmarker> No , so we we should use something else . And you <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah , and usually <disfmarker> because we do not have a a a a a home um <disfmarker> But I believe you will have an <disfmarker> We do not control the T_V_ set so well . And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , Yes , m yes . S and we b we want <gap> to make so it's <gap> <disfmarker> is easy as possible for our customers , and it's <disfmarker> Okay . so we should think about <disfmarker> So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us . <vocalsound> It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . <vocalsound> And b Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh <disfmarker> Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , Yeah , a peak . Yeah . which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . Yeah . But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep . Yeah , that's true . Yes , <vocalsound> so we don't want that . But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . Maybe we can <disfmarker> Something like that . Well Well , if you lost th is there not something f something more easily <disfmarker> Well uh <disfmarker> I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the <disfmarker> their remote . Well , I don't think uh <gap> . Uh that's just uh <disfmarker> No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh <gap> . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , Yeah . so w we should use have <disfmarker> uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . <gap> just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility . Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think . So that's not a good idea . Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , I will . Yeah . Yes . because that's his <disfmarker> his field of expertise . Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated Mm-hmm . um and it will become more costly also . Yep . Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh function ? Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . It's a unique item uh <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . It will be an <disfmarker> a unique feature of our remote control . It's a different <disfmarker> Yeah . exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , Yeah . and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and <disfmarker> probably more i interesting than uh than the lights . And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um <vocalsound> an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . Yeah . What should we choose in in design ? Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . Well , the extra functions . So <disfmarker> I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . Okay . Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most <disfmarker> the second-most used function . Used option . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh well <disfmarker> yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important . Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Well , we skip that . So <disfmarker> Well , Okay . so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . No , no . No . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Nope . So that's out of the question . Yeah . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one . I think also . Yes . Well , So <disfmarker> we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions No . and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface Yeah . and <disfmarker> Okay , Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple <disfmarker> Uh well if we um include other uh innovative functions <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh then they uh might , Mm-hmm . 'cause young people uh like new features . Mm yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah , that's right . Okay , so Mm . this is is kind of uh <disfmarker> Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . Okay . Well , is it <disfmarker> maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . Yeah . Maybe it's more important to make the <disfmarker> make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless <disfmarker> But but are we not in in the in the manual uh <disfmarker> I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise . Yeah , But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? I don't know yet . <vocalsound> Because we do not implement uh a user history . Mm-hmm . There's <disfmarker> no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um <disfmarker> W Mm-hmm . Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that . And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button . Yeah . Yes . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions . But does it <disfmarker> uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , should we just use a <disfmarker> Yeah , draw draw it on the board . Um it's already uh <disfmarker> oh , we have a blank . Oh . Oh yeah , something like that . It's not really a stick , It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what <disfmarker> which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . but <disfmarker> Yes . Yes . A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down Hmm . Yeah , it can break down . or uh Yes , yes . Yeah . just a round uh button should be the trick , I think . And <disfmarker> Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . I think it it will attract uh more uh uh public , I think . Yeah . A younger uh <disfmarker> Huh . But you're the marketing man . And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . Geez . Well , volume and something uh like that . <vocalsound> Uh-huh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The programme up and down . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , yeah . And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want . Okay , that's good . Okay , but w we still <vocalsound> we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness . Mm-hmm . But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's <disfmarker> um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have <disfmarker> has the information to discuss about that , I think . Um well , for <disfmarker> we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yes ? Yeah . We need to um have the uh the user function <disfmarker> uh the functions decided and um <vocalsound> uh our target audience . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . 'Kay , Okay . but teletext is so uh is just scrapped . Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ? Um well , I do not want a full uh <disfmarker> it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting . Okay . Okay . Mm-hmm . The ten digits . Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . <gap> l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but <disfmarker> Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change Mm-hmm . Yes . Yeah . A bit of a split mode . Change . Uh l like <disfmarker> Yeah . <disfmarker> yeah . Yes , yes . Dual channel watch . Yes . Yeah . Okay , well um m maybe I should write that down . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> you're the secretary . <vocalsound> Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ? Mielsen . Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh <disfmarker> Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um <disfmarker> Mm okay , Alright . but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's that's <disfmarker> Yeah . if you want to do it , Sebastian . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sure . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh <disfmarker> <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <disfmarker> Okay , um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay , so so um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> Volume . Programme . Uh dual channel . Uh <disfmarker> Yes , that's important . And and do we want um the ten digits ? The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so . Well , are are you sure ? Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . I'm not so sure . Yeah . Well , that's complicated , Yeah . but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think <disfmarker> but you should uh shou you should know that . If it were so . I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . Okay , I can imagine when Uh and I think the most <disfmarker> I agree actually . <vocalsound> I can imagine when you're <disfmarker> when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . Just elder elder people would would buy it , Well <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh <disfmarker> <gap> <disfmarker> you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough . But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . But <disfmarker> Yep . Yeah , The older people only use five of them . and if if we <disfmarker> Well , but how how often do you watch all these channels ? And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . Often . So <disfmarker> No , you're probably right . Yeah . Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ? Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , The design . on the on the <disfmarker> On the design . Okay . Well , y then there should be <disfmarker> should done <disfmarker> be done something specific with it . Well <disfmarker> You c <vocalsound> you can d make them very fancy And <disfmarker> by um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones Mm-hmm . and it still looks very fancy . Yeah . So I'm I'm <disfmarker> I do not agree <disfmarker> Okay , so you can experiment by <disfmarker> uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . Exactly , exactly . Okay . And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh for <disfmarker> Okay , speech . Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . Yeah . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . Yeah . And it's very easy uh to find your remote control . To find <disfmarker> yeah . So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . Yeah . But maybe when we uh <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> If if we would um drop the ten digits Mm-hmm . but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um <disfmarker> Okay . Okay , okay . Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it Okay . Yes . it's a board uh decision . Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that . So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . Okay . Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button <disfmarker> uh remote control function . Mm-hmm . So that's that's a big advantage , I think . Okay . Okay , g good . <vocalsound> Okay . There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . Mm . But maybe can <disfmarker> we we can think something smart about it . Yep . There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . Okay . So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . But <disfmarker> But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ? You have to do nothing for it . M <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Twelve dollar fifty . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe , maybe not . Because it seems like a very <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . I'll have to find that out . Yes . So <disfmarker> No , that's very cheap . 'Cause when <disfmarker> Is a cradle very cheap ? It's <disfmarker> Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts . I know , It's <disfmarker> b uh but there should be an adapter as well . Yes , but they're they're mass production . Yeah . They're very cheap . So it will cost us p practically nothing . Okay . Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um <vocalsound> I would like to hear um <disfmarker> maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ? Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh want to sell to . So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . <vocalsound> But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . Okay . So <disfmarker> I don't think that's a big problem Okay . Yeah . Okay , so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh <disfmarker> Profitable . We we <disfmarker> yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . Yes . Yeah , profitable . Profitable . Yes . Okay . O okay . <vocalsound> Um Roo . I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think . <gap> <disfmarker> Nothing to add . Sebastian ? Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um Yeah ? Great . so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that <disfmarker> these kinds of things . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . Yep . Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not <disfmarker> do not implement these buttons . <vocalsound> If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another <disfmarker> Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board <disfmarker> well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that <disfmarker> we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . Yeah . And this even uh makes it more cheapy . But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? Mm-hmm . The board . The circuit board . The circuit board . The fewer buttons you can use on it . The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . No , it's th yeah . Yeah , okay . It's the other way around , yeah . Yeah . And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's that's another advantage . It shouldn't be a big issue . Well it <disfmarker> then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh <disfmarker> especially for the voice recognition . So <disfmarker> Yes , because I don't know <disfmarker> Yes . I d I really don't know . So <disfmarker> No . It can be costly . Okay . Maybe not . I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that . Yes . Um I'm not sure how how that <disfmarker> Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh <vocalsound> have a lo uh look at it . <vocalsound> Yep . <vocalsound> Okay , great . Um <vocalsound> well , I think we're qui quite done . We're done , I think . Um for now we will have the lunch break . How nice . Um I'm <disfmarker> don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . Me neither . Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um <vocalsound> the Interface Designer , um I would like to <disfmarker> the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . Interface <disfmarker> industrial . Uh <disfmarker> I'm sorry , yeah , Yeah . <vocalsound> I'm sorry . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . Well , we understand . <vocalsound> And um Uh the only problem is it <disfmarker> that it depends on the divisions <disfmarker> the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , i it should be easy , Well <disfmarker> that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um <vocalsound> um yeah , some some fancy lights . Mm yes . Yeah . I think that's what we decided . So we drop the voice recognition ? No no no , we didn't <disfmarker> Or <disfmarker> Oh . but it shouldn't be integrated <disfmarker> yeah , it's <disfmarker> of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the <disfmarker> Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ? No . We can decide the next meeting . Yep . Okay . Because I'll have some updated info on that uh <disfmarker> Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . Yep . And I'm sure the market will um uh <vocalsound> <gap> uh will change , adapt Hmm . Adapt . Adapt . Left . Hmm . and um so we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now . That's it . 'Kay . Any other questions or can we have the lunch ? We can have the lunch . Yeah . Yeah , okay . I'll take the lunch . Good .
Okay . So , now um , <vocalsound> last time . Can you uh <vocalsound> push the button ? <vocalsound> One time please . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I'm still the secretary . Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your <disfmarker> you two . <vocalsound> I don't care . <vocalsound> Oh this , you mean ? Huh ? Yes . The prototype . Yes , well uh this is it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This is it . Well , thank you . Uh , now <disfmarker> It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber . And and and this too . The <vocalsound> the sides . Yes . And the rest is hard plastic . And uh <disfmarker> We uh we had some uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> We had a new idea <vocalsound> that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . <vocalsound> And then it covers the <disfmarker> these buttons Okay . until here or something . Yes . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick . Mm-hmm . So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu . And then it can break . Okay . And the buttons ? Uh , well uh <disfmarker> Big . <vocalsound> Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh <disfmarker> yeah , and the mute and the the other button . <vocalsound> Yeah . Channel higher channel button . <gap> . Yeah . And the joystick is for the volume and the channels . Uh , yes . Yes , Yes . that's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very obvious . Up is channel up . <vocalsound> Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down . Yeah . Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . What's the R_R_ <gap> d <vocalsound> The R_R_ ? R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo . Okay . Very good . <vocalsound> So , we have <disfmarker> That's on the rub rubber part . Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here . So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . Oh . So , that's it . That's prototype . Yeah ? Now , the finance . <vocalsound> We don't know if it's <disfmarker> th it <disfmarker> if it's okay . Alright . <vocalsound> So , I'm gonna look . Do we <disfmarker> Do we change the <disfmarker> We have <disfmarker> Sorry ? Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ? Finance is um <disfmarker> Yeah it's <disfmarker> No , first uh <disfmarker> Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . Okay . Sorry . That's uh um <disfmarker> <gap> That can be none . Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up . Uh-oh . Okay . Um , yeah . Well , we uh <disfmarker> uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences . Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh <disfmarker> Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . <vocalsound> So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . Yeah . Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Criteria . You <disfmarker> <gap> So we open up that blank here . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Think I can <disfmarker> Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can get a number in here . Hmm . No , it's okay . Well , uh we can't do that . I'll get it . Oh , it's okay . Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative . Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together . And in the end , we will c uh count an average of all rating . The first uh on each item . What do you think ? Yeah , I think it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh <disfmarker> it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ . So , it <disfmarker> Um , I think I will give it a <disfmarker> yeah , yeah , yeah <gap> , a four . Hmm . I think the scroll-button is something also uh new . <vocalsound> What uh <disfmarker> not anoth uh , not a lot of uh <disfmarker> a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an seven . Si six six . <gap> Yeah . Sorry , six . So now i I think you uh see it <gap> um its statement . And you <gap> true or false . Oh , true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . And true is one . So , yeah . Yeah . Two . Sorry . You ? Three . Me too . So it's a three . 'Kay . Um , well <disfmarker> It's a one . <vocalsound> The first item . So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers . Mm <disfmarker> Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that . So it's a <disfmarker> That's uh a six . Five . Mm , four . Yes , it's for the younger g group . Yeah , but it's it's <disfmarker> So it's uh half half of the people . So I think it's four . Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . So <disfmarker> I mean , the colours are for young people , Mm-hmm . No . but Yes . So , I think it's four . older <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe version uh three point O_ uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> has other colours . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe . Okay . Give it a four . Four . Four . Yep . Uh , okay . Mm . We put the fashion in electronics . That's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um <disfmarker> Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two . Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two . <vocalsound> Yes . Two . Two . Uh , I say uh a five . It's not fashion , it's new . It must be a fashion . But it isn't . It <disfmarker> it will be fashion . Yes . It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Then make it th three . Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . No . 'Kay . Three is okay . Oh . Yeah , agree ? I use my feet though . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , we'll wait outside . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A three . Okay . Yeah okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five . I give it a one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . Yes , a one . I like it . Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . <vocalsound> We have to do our uh <disfmarker> Say two . Two or three ? Okay , two . Two . Two . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that's why it's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to <vocalsound> uh this fashion , I <disfmarker> We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . One . <vocalsound> You ? One . <vocalsound> Me too . One . One . <vocalsound> Um , but <vocalsound> where where is the <gap> ? <vocalsound> Next , six . It does not get lost easily . So <disfmarker> Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Just a small thing . <vocalsound> No , we did not . Yeah , but uh <disfmarker> So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? Yeah . Ah . Yellow . I don't think so . <vocalsound> Looks like a pistol . Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . No . It won't get lost . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> It won't . A one ? <vocalsound> Yeah , o one . Yeah . Okay , a one . One . Next . Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . <gap> Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . Yeah me <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah . Me too . That was our target . Two . Two . Yeah . Yeah ? Yep . Yeah . Right . There's a fancy look-and-feel . Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um <disfmarker> Well , let's also give this a two . T I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy <gap> trendy . Okay . Yes , a one . I say a two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . Yeah . So I think s two is better . Yeah , okay . Okay . Two . Two is okay . And um , then the last one I could think of , <gap> . uh it goes with the latest trends . No , it's new . Innovation . If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh <disfmarker> We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . Oh . So , I would <disfmarker> did not give this uh a one or two . I <disfmarker> We'll go for a three . I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . <gap> . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Yes . Uh <disfmarker> But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . Okay . Mm , three . Me too . Three . A three . Yeah . Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . So , we will do that . Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , <gap> . Yes . Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third . By nine . Two . Yeah . Um , uh okay . <vocalsound> Two . Yep . Come on . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh , nah . Okay . So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> So , it's good . So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Thank you . Yeah , I think <gap> . Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes . And I closed your slide-show . Okay . Back to my uh <disfmarker> Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming . Yep . Next please . Next . Finance . So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh <disfmarker> I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery . Mm-hmm . Cheapest there is . Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip . Expensive . Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one . Well , it's the most advanced . We have the simple , regular and advanced . Advanced . We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . <gap> we have half rubber , half plastic . Mm , yes . No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow . Yeah . Uh , yellow . <vocalsound> Mm , yeah . Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . <vocalsound> So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? One . One . And it's not really a s Joystick uh thing . <gap> . Yeah , it's this one . <vocalsound> Now , uh button supplement . Special colour . We already <disfmarker> Uh , that's the <disfmarker> from the <disfmarker> for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour . Mm , yeah . So , then uh <disfmarker> then then then then then then <disfmarker> Then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We're not gonna make it . <vocalsound> Uh , no . It's too expensive . Yeah . <vocalsound> Wh So , we have to change something . What what are the costs ? <vocalsound> Fifteen Euros . Fifteen . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour . <gap> . We would have uh n A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour . Oh , no , we <disfmarker> No , it's uh <disfmarker> Sorry ? Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? For a remote control . <vocalsound> What ? I've <disfmarker> For a remote control , I think it is . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . And what if we use only one sort of um <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Um <vocalsound> just only plastic or only rubber ? That's one Euro . One Euro discount . <vocalsound> So , I don't think that's good . Mm <disfmarker> I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If <disfmarker> If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . Yes . Then it's only thirteen Euros . <vocalsound> And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? So uh <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Then you have <disfmarker> Or you have to cut this off . Uh <disfmarker> uh-uh . Then it's not good anymore . No . So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look . <vocalsound> We <disfmarker> And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour <disfmarker> it's a normal colour , wh <vocalsound> No one will see it . <vocalsound> Yellow rubber . Yeah , normal . Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . Uh <disfmarker> And it's twelve Euros , I think . One minute , please . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is it maximum . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , it's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ? No . Uh , no , no , no . Or it's then a regular ? Uh <disfmarker> Oh , wait wait wait . The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? Yeah . Oh yeah . So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . Yeah , regular chip . But <disfmarker> Is it a good design ? Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have the L_C_D_ . If uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So , the T_V_s has to uh <disfmarker> have to be up-to-date . If we have the n no buttons <disfmarker> If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have <disfmarker> uh , we have thirteen Euros ? Yeah . Mm , yes . And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? Yeah . Then it's okay . Huh . No knew that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we <disfmarker> then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour , Okay . All the same uh <disfmarker> you have to pay point two Euros . So , all the buttons has to <disfmarker> have to be the same colour . Yes . But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ? Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Recognisable , yeah . Like what <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . Mm , yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah ? Okay . Okay . <gap> So <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , well that's clear . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> And <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Where's <gap> ? Yeah . So , now it's <disfmarker> And the joystick away . And its buttons . Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones . Yeah . Now it's <disfmarker> <gap> still , he waited at the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very good . No . Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well <disfmarker> What do you think of it ? Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> About the Project . About the project . process . Went good . Uh <disfmarker> I think uh the creativity uh <vocalsound> was good enough . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um <disfmarker> Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh <disfmarker> no , uh o only the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . <vocalsound> Nope . Okay . And you . Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , it uh <disfmarker> It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it . Okay . Yeah . Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um <disfmarker> Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . Mm-hmm . Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor <gap> and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion . Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . <vocalsound> No . So , it's good for the speed . No . Yep . So , I think we're ready . Yeah . Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Beer . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's it . Yeah ? Okay then . Okay . <gap> .
<gap> Do you need to change anything on it ? Um <disfmarker> Mm , don't think so . Because otherwise I will already open it . Okay . Unless uh things have suddenly change again . Is it much changes ? Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information , <vocalsound> like uh last time . Uh I didn't <disfmarker> No no . I do hot have <disfmarker> Only the same information . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Hello , Sebastian . Hello hello Mister P_M_ . I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , that's where the thinking goes on . <vocalsound> Oh , it's that Roo again , always late . <vocalsound> Bongiorno . Bongiorno . I think you should punish him . You're the P_M_ . <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Punish . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I see some interesting <disfmarker> <vocalsound> okay . Possibilities , yeah ? <vocalsound> You wish . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> People , welcome back . Welcome . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The third meeting . <vocalsound> Oop . Um I have some points I would like to <disfmarker> uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um <vocalsound> first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ? If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down , Yeah . so I could <disfmarker> uh can uh um use that in the in the report . <vocalsound> Um the second thing , um <vocalsound> I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . That's quite strange . <vocalsound> Yes . Okay . So <disfmarker> We'll come to that later , I g I think . Um <vocalsound> the agenda for now <disfmarker> uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ? <vocalsound> No . Not at all . No . Okay . Um <vocalsound> we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um <vocalsound> I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . Okay . Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , 'Kay . because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation . Hmm ? Alright . Oh . <vocalsound> <gap> . Just press the okay button , it works . Yeah , <gap> <disfmarker> Okay . Um yeah . Yeah . Yeah . My method ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> How surprising . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , findings . Uh <disfmarker> Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and that they want spongy material . Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes <gap> uh m material . But we <disfmarker> since we are concentrating on uh the younger group <disfmarker> Uh w wait a sec wait a se Oh wait uh wait up . uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes 'Kay . Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah <gap> okay . The feel of <gap> to be spongy <disfmarker> Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ? Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something . Not something dull . Okay . But they like dark colours , you said in the p No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful uh objects . <vocalsound> Okay . Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . But <disfmarker> I had <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But can you can you go back to that slide ? The <disfmarker> uh Which one ? This ? just one slide back , no no no . Yes . Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy . Yes . Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh well , it might . <vocalsound> But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But <disfmarker> Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge . Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it <disfmarker> maybe it rubber or or <disfmarker> Yeah , exactly . yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , Or we could make <disfmarker> oh . but that doesn't mean we should use wood , So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . Yeah . So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like . Well , that's interesting . It's quite interesting . <vocalsound> You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover . Yeah , o o Yes . I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh <vocalsound> telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . It's the it's the rubber uh cover . Yeah , it is , it is i yeah . And it's uh colourful . It looks likes a banana . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> We have the fruit , we have the colours . <vocalsound> We have the simple design . Do you know the phone ? I don't know the phone , but I can imagine it . It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five , Um thirty five . I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away , Oh , that one , yes . the very <disfmarker> And the b the light blue and <vocalsound> it's also in yellow . Now I kn uh <disfmarker> oh , I know , I know . Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it . You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th I've seen it , but <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Um uh okay . Do you have <gap> <disfmarker> uh thit <disfmarker> that was <disfmarker> 'Kay . Uh that's about it . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the <disfmarker> our target group . <vocalsound> Yes . And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . Uh soft material . Okay . So <disfmarker> So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ? Uh the fancy look and feel . Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers . Yes . Apparently . Okay , Roo , Yeah . could you do your presentation ? Mm-hmm . Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh the previous uh discussion . Um <disfmarker> Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about . <vocalsound> Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and <vocalsound> just um , well , a weird um shape . Shape . So I suggest <disfmarker> I couldn't uh <disfmarker> I had a small uh mock-up uh <vocalsound> sign on the <vocalsound> on <gap> paper . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple <vocalsound> f uh a shape on uh <disfmarker> in um PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow . Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good . Yeah . Yeah . And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um <disfmarker> I mean this is how you hold a remote control . Yes . Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery , Slippery . s because um <disfmarker> But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . You have to grab it . Yeah . So it's easy in your hand <disfmarker> Uh indeed . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah . so you can get a really good grip on it . Yeah . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier . Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , <vocalsound> So m Yes . But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation . okay . Okay , good . <vocalsound> Great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal , Yeah . yeah . So if you have the voice recognition , you can <vocalsound> you can programme like thirty uh um thirty c uh controls on it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , Okay , b but I think we'll <disfmarker> but I'll I'll go into that , yeah . because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a <disfmarker> it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing . <vocalsound> We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . Okay . Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that . Yeah . Right . But it's quite uh advanced and it's it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source <disfmarker> source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . <vocalsound> Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh <vocalsound> remote controls . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You really have to imagine like <vocalsound> winding up your <disfmarker> uh <vocalsound> Great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , I d it would be very new to the market , <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're <disfmarker> you you have to um make some kind of energy <disfmarker> kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . Like the watch . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It have <disfmarker> it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing . I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . Mm-hmm . It's very funny indeed . I mean solar is <disfmarker> of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . Mm-hmm . Indeed . Um hand dynamo <disfmarker> But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and <disfmarker> Well , maybe m if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . Yeah , I know . Mm-hmm . Yes . You you walk and uh <disfmarker> but uh Yeah . But you know you know from your own watch <disfmarker> your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . you <disfmarker> you're sitting on a couch . <gap> the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a <disfmarker> in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something , Yeah . And wha well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind . Okay . So , but maybe <vocalsound> maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , Yeah . and otherwise use the batteries . Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . Uh yes , it does . Yeah . I'll come to that later . Okay . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . <vocalsound> The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . Um <vocalsound> uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . <vocalsound> Yes . That is possible too . Yes . <gap> <disfmarker> But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels <disfmarker> I had some <disfmarker> I had some information about it too . Mm-hmm . I don't think <vocalsound> there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . Well <disfmarker> I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions . This will be the remote , Yeah . right ? Um with uh maybe a channel selector . What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? Yeah , uh that's a possibility , Uh it's do it's done before . but <disfmarker> Because this is how you keep it <disfmarker> Yes . It's quite quite good , yes . But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for <disfmarker> Volume ? Well , it's it <disfmarker> well , i what he means is there's an <disfmarker> button integrated in the scroll-wheel . A volume , okay . There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel . Well , what about mute ? About mute . Well , Thi i i m I guess uh th yes . this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um <disfmarker> Okay . Yes . Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay . And click it to muten the device . Well , okay . It's quite goods . And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . Mm-hmm . Yes . So maybe um <disfmarker> I guess that <disfmarker> that's something you two uh need to think about . Yeah . Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh well , Wheel . it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers . Hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this . Yeah . And <disfmarker> Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . So maybe it's not no <gap> . Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . Nokia has a <disfmarker> well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this . Hmm . Yes , but it uses two separate buttons . Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah . It doesn't use a <disfmarker> <gap> . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here . <vocalsound> For you too , yeah . Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . Wi within reach . Yes , you have to . So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect . Yes . <gap> yes . Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay . Sebastian . Um <disfmarker> Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . There's <disfmarker> there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . Yeah . So that's a limitation . <vocalsound> About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah , you can um <disfmarker> I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word <disfmarker> you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay . So <disfmarker> so <disfmarker> okay . Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . So that's the sample sensor . Okay . So if you say mute , it says mute again , Mm-hmm . and then it's um <disfmarker> well , I believe it's uh <disfmarker> It performs the action . Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what <disfmarker> which he believes it is . Yeah . Okay . So you say mute , Yeah . he repeats mute and you <disfmarker> makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper . Okay . Uh well <disfmarker> uh Okay . d did we already decide on the display ? To <disfmarker> Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here to think about . Yeah . Well , I don't have um <disfmarker> I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information <disfmarker> uh y I don't think you need it on a display . No . Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh <disfmarker> I I don't think either . No . I don't think you need it . 'cause uh <gap> uh all <disfmarker> any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , On screen display . yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okay , well Okay th my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the <disfmarker> a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper . Okay . Good . So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . <vocalsound> Kineti okay . The kinetic thing it <gap> it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm <disfmarker> I think you should combine it with batteries . Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy , Otherwise it will not <disfmarker> too advanced , too <disfmarker> uh well . yeah . It's <disfmarker> in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . But <disfmarker> Yeah , but that <disfmarker> that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different . Yes . And I think it's more robust . It's more uh Uh it's more functional . Yeah . Okay . But what about um the markets <vocalsound> uh wants colourfuls uh designs ? So if you use titanium <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No no , but the uh um <disfmarker> that's what Sebastian said . The titanium thing uh we have to skip it . <vocalsound> He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . Okay . But but yet , I understood that the market is different . Oh , sorry . Yeah . So um <disfmarker> So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , Yeah . and we should uh use wood or something like that . And And I would think <disfmarker> yeah , No , the <disfmarker> r rubber with colours . yeah , the older people liked wood . Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber . No the <disfmarker> Colourful Yeah , the younger people liked soft material . Okay . and <disfmarker> Okay , spongy materials . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy . So <disfmarker> And they can be implemented with a regular chip ? Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple <disfmarker> Okay , but we also <disfmarker> uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker <disfmarker> Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh <disfmarker> a different <disfmarker> oh , But but do we want the curved uh uh design , evalu or <disfmarker> <gap> I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull . I it's too dull . Yeah . Yeah . I don't think c our customers will like it . And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot <disfmarker> um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . Yeah . So I think this is the best of two worlds . Okay . Okay . Okay , what about um <vocalsound> the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Yes . Because it it's of cour It's it's <disfmarker> uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . Yeah . It's very unlogical . <vocalsound> But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all . Well the Well <disfmarker> there has to be some pointing at . But <disfmarker> It depends also on your on your <disfmarker> Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just <vocalsound> to the other wall . Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably <disfmarker> you're probably right . Yeah . But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um <disfmarker> yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue . All lights get absorbed , yeah . <vocalsound> Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . So <disfmarker> Yeah . So <vocalsound> it has an <disfmarker> it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker . Um with a with a regular chip . And the regular chip . I think uh it gives us the advantage of <disfmarker> And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yes , yes . Yeah . <vocalsound> I like the scroll wheels uh idea . And uh skip <disfmarker> and skip the L_C_D_ part . Yeah . I don't think it it's any uh value added thing . No . Think so too . So <disfmarker> Well , it looks <disfmarker> Okay . uh yeah , well um according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , Technology . and I mean L_C_D_ is <disfmarker> Yes . It's not very flashy and new . well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard Standard ? than than <disfmarker> Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem . Mm-hmm . Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , Mm-hmm . because it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it . Yes . But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . Mm yeah . Uh I think our customers will go insane . Okay , okay . <vocalsound> It's it's too much . Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to um add or or maybe thoughts or <disfmarker> Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M No ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ? <gap> Roo , do you have any other <disfmarker> Um no . Nothing more . <vocalsound> Nothing more . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Uh the n the next phase will be um the um <disfmarker> not the <disfmarker> Sebas what is the next phase <gap> f Flores ? <vocalsound> Well , we we <vocalsound> need to describe uh decisions now . Okay . So um So i on the energy , well , we decided . Okay . Chip . Okay . The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . Okay , okay . User interface um Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yes , they can work . Yeah , okay . Sorry , They cannot work with double-curved . yeah . Oh , sorry . That's that's problem . Yeah . I'll check it for you . Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . Yeah . <vocalsound> Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . Yes . Mm-hmm . And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . Okay . And I'm going uh to plan my holidays . <vocalsound> Okay . So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The project drawing is for the next <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's it's uh <disfmarker> when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready . Yeah , right . Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ? Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down . I'll do . Great . Um <disfmarker> Uh you you need to help me . Um <disfmarker> Okay . W start with the casing . The casing is curved , single-curved . Single-curved . Okay , single-curved case . Okay . What about the energy source ? Traditional batteries uh and solar . But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ? 'Cause if we have to choose <disfmarker> No , they can be complementary . I I think they can . Yes . Uh al al I uh <disfmarker> yeah ? Okay . Well , uh <disfmarker> What if not ? Every device <disfmarker> It it should be . There should be really no problem . They can be supplementary . Okay . That's no problem . Yeah . Okay , um So <disfmarker> So uh uh th just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . Battery and solar , yeah . Okay . What about uh the finishing of the case ? We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? Yeah , with colourful rubber . Yeah . Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish . Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . <gap> uh black and yellow . Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah . Grey and yellow . Grey yellow , okay . Yellow case and grey buttons , I think . Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , Hmm . but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours . Oh , I think it's uh <disfmarker> it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ? Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before . I believe the <disfmarker> But you have already um <disfmarker> you must have a red uh on and off button . And um <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> well <disfmarker> Well , it it doesn't have to be red . Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image Hmm . or or <disfmarker> I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess . Okay . Or black and yellow . Black and yellow , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , <vocalsound> but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But <disfmarker> Well , there is . <vocalsound> Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , Oh , I've read . Yeah . Yes . with <gap> and uh <disfmarker> Yes , but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . They're actually very slow in its techniques . Okay , So <disfmarker> So I'm afraid it's not possible . so we have to deal with wh what's possible here . Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> A scroll-wheel . The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided . Voice recognition , of course . Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . Yeah . And th the <disfmarker> they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too . Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What what did you say ? Well uh you can use <disfmarker> well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . So it has th the spongy uh feel also . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber . <vocalsound> I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , Yeah , b or or i But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually . <gap> . What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber . Uh is that <disfmarker> uh does our our supplier say so ? It is not uh something uh <disfmarker> it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from <disfmarker> Uh didn't <disfmarker> did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? No , but but uh it <disfmarker> 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button . Yeah . You could place a <disfmarker> um uh this this would be the button . There <disfmarker> the icons . The scroll-wheel , I mean . Yeah , b yeah . And you could place the indica th th the signals the <disfmarker> Yes . So you don't touch the icons that much . That's okay . Yeah , that's possible , but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting . No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or <disfmarker> But it's into the rubber . Yeah . Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus . Yes , the signs . You have to draw the <disfmarker> Yeah , but this is on the pla yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh <disfmarker> You just move the problem . What about um making this rubber and making this plastic ? Uh I see what you mean . Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two . Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . Yeah . But the front , on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . Mm-hmm . I mean <disfmarker> Well , I'm I'm not so sure , I think it c should be Y uh can you separate these uh these <disfmarker> Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber . <vocalsound> I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ? <vocalsound> I think both . I mean , I I never touch between the buttons . I do . <vocalsound> I do . Or the s uh the sideways . I think <disfmarker> Or the the back . Or the back . Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the <disfmarker> these buttons ? I think <disfmarker> Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or <disfmarker> i you play with it . Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . Yeah . I'm going to leave the decision to you , um because you have to make its prototype , and um <disfmarker> yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . so I'm going to leave it <disfmarker> the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ? Um not quite . Um what about uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ? Regular . Okay . Yeah . And <disfmarker> Use with <gap> . Well <disfmarker> no , I think that's about it . Yes . Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really <disfmarker> The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all . Okay , well . And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ . Yeah . Okay . So <disfmarker> Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished . Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes <gap> . and um <disfmarker> For the finishing touch . Yeah ? Yeah , um Okay . if you write <disfmarker> wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ? Okay . Uh yeah . Yeah . But um Sebastian has everything . I know , but <disfmarker> well <disfmarker> I'll put it online . Great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right .
That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . Like this one . But uh we don't uh we don't uh <disfmarker> we do think it's um well <disfmarker> what if with ease of use , w which prefers the <disfmarker> which the the customer of the user prefers . It's important . Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that . Okay . They n they need to understand what <disfmarker> uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ? Yeah , maybe so . Yes , A a and the voice recognition as well , it's <disfmarker> th maybe you could uh could uh <disfmarker> Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um <gap> . <vocalsound> There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . <vocalsound> Yeah . It's it's quite easy . Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ? Yes , rubber ? And the buttons ? <vocalsound> Plastic or rubber . <vocalsound> There are plastic or rubber . Well , yeah . Okay , and uh the colouring ? Uh yellow with uh <gap> with with grey or black . grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , <vocalsound> we'll we'll come to that later . Um <vocalsound> okay . Anything else to add or <disfmarker> No . <vocalsound> Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . Yeah . Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> 'cause you have to assign two channel <disfmarker> new channels . Yes , but it <disfmarker> but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . M uh Or not ? yeah . M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition . You <disfmarker> Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that . And a button for disabling the voice recognition . Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it <disfmarker> you'd disable it with a little beep and and <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . but o okay , that that's not really really important . <vocalsound> That's the basic idea , yeah . Of our prototype . <vocalsound> The basic <disfmarker> okay . Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? Yes . Okay . Uh my name is not name but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You are nameless . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh well , I used the <gap> <disfmarker> the uh <gap> documents . And these uh were the most important criteria . <vocalsound> Is it spongy ? <vocalsound> It should be . <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So <disfmarker> So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything <disfmarker> I believe uh Uh well I believe it's fancy . <vocalsound> appar I believe it's fancy too . Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . No . Oh , So <disfmarker> sorry . Okay . Okay , so this <disfmarker> these are the cr uh the criteria . Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria . Okay , well <disfmarker> So uh that's about it . the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um <disfmarker> The production costs . The costs are not under <disfmarker> Can I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um this is the <disfmarker> Twenty two . Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . Yikes . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . Well it's very expensive . So I guess we should skip that , because it's not that important . Okay . Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . yeah . The number of uh <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um And and does it <disfmarker> if you would <disfmarker> if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um <vocalsound> to make it <vocalsound> just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , Mm-hmm . um by not using the voice recognition feature , Mm-hmm . because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , I believe <disfmarker> Uh , push-button , well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It makes it the thirteen <disfmarker> yeah . Push-buttons are <disfmarker> buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . Hmm . So um <disfmarker> yeah , th this design is not um within our price model . Okay . Um <disfmarker> But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there . Yeah . So it's c way too expensive . It's still too expensive , yeah . Um <disfmarker> But that's that's only for the buttons . So the button we can use plastic . I I guess if we leave the <disfmarker> if we leave this one out , um <disfmarker> oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh maybe not use the special form . And the pla uh <disfmarker> And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber . But it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . Yes . But it's the board decision . Um <disfmarker> And um <disfmarker> yeah . Well , b basically it <vocalsound> <disfmarker> when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . Yeah . Yeah , I know . So <disfmarker> Maybe we should look at an <disfmarker> uh focus on another uh <disfmarker> Type of m maybe another market segment . Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic Yeah . Yes . and uh m maximise the profits and um <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> maybe that's better . <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe we could uh <disfmarker> we should go for straight and simple , Yeah . but that's not what uh has been asked . I know , I know . So we should kick the board's uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Although I think we <disfmarker> yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . Hmm . Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . Yes . Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's not that innovative . <vocalsound> Or however you s pronounce that . <vocalsound> Um so , okay . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Oh , Yeah , too bad . <vocalsound> this is the wrong one . So uh that means redesign . <vocalsound> We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> but we can evaluate the process and um uh uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first . I guess <disfmarker> Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , that's true . Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . We l we can learn . Yeah . Yeah . I agree . So <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> Is it fancy ? <vocalsound> I d it is it is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yay . Is it ? Is it fancy ? Yeah , I think so . Um the yellow rubber , I think so . I think so . <vocalsound> You like the rubber , uh Roo . <vocalsound> I'm into it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So uh one ? But it's not that fancy . Yeah . No , I mean I'll I'll I'll give it a two . I think uh <disfmarker> I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing <disfmarker> the casing . It would be even more <disfmarker> You like tita <vocalsound> <vocalsound> oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's a flavour as well . <vocalsound> It has flavour . Yes , that's right . <vocalsound> You should taste it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is it uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I know , but but it <disfmarker> but that's fancy in the way um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I mean fancy has has a lot of <disfmarker> It has to do with fashion , I guess . Yeah . So do <disfmarker> It's trendy trendy , fun <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And w yeah , yeah . w what they want <disfmarker> wanted was uh colours and soft materials . So in that way <disfmarker> It <disfmarker> it's fancy . Yeah . It applies . It <disfmarker> yeah . Well , just <vocalsound> give it a two . Okay . Yeah . Yes . I think I th I think it would have been <disfmarker> I would have think <disfmarker> uh It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but <disfmarker> it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . Yeah , but that's sti that's uh <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't <disfmarker> we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three . Yes . So I believe uh we are close uh to two . Yeah , I I agree . Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did <gap> <disfmarker> yes , we did good . Okay , and uh was it innovative ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , with the voice recognition feature and uh <disfmarker> But that's not in it . Yep . Ov or can we <disfmarker> No , Well , we are evaluating this this uh design now . This prototype . let's let's <disfmarker> this product . Okay . So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative . Yeah . <vocalsound> And the scroll uh wheel . The solar <disfmarker> not many remotes have the solar , I think . No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , Yeah , and uh <disfmarker> but it's it's way too <disfmarker> That would have been a thrill . yes , but <disfmarker> So uh also a uh two ? I think uh it's a two . Yep . Is it easy to use ? I'm not sure . <vocalsound> I'm not sure . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . Well , hard <disfmarker> it's not for the for the e for the elderly . <vocalsound> Well , They won't use it . but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . Yeah . That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . So in that in that way it is advanced , Yeah . and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users . So uh <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> I think a three . It's maybe <disfmarker> it's not very uh easy for <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Wouldn't give it more . Uh I'm doubting <disfmarker> doubting as well . Um <disfmarker> Well the p the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . Okay . It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ? Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I <gap> <disfmarker> I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use , Yeah . because he is already <disfmarker> he or she is already an advanced user . Yeah . So <disfmarker> After all , I think <disfmarker> personally I would give a two . Um <disfmarker> Okay . But <disfmarker> Uh Roo , a three ? Yep . Ruud ? Good question . Uh I'll go uh for the two . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . <vocalsound> So that's ten . So I could make it e easy ? If you make it a four it will be three in general . So that's w No , two and a half . If he makes it a four . Not a three . Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half . So <disfmarker> Darn . Nee . Hmm ? Huh ? Yes . <vocalsound> Roo . <vocalsound> A seven , a three <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No . Yeah . I yeah <gap> . A four and a three together . <vocalsound> Four ? Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? Yeah , two , two , three <disfmarker> Two ? And a three ? No , I haven't said anything yet . No . <vocalsound> Nee . I know . Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . Divided by four . Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three <disfmarker> three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's not even <disfmarker> But I'm filling in a three . Does it <disfmarker> will <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so it will be a two point five . But that's not possible to fill in , Yes , it is . so we have to round it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is it easy to find ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I have a veto . <vocalsound> Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about <disfmarker> okay , um is it easy to f Yeah , definitely . Yes . Yeah , we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . It it most definitely is <disfmarker> it's very easy . Yeah , or beeps or <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh <disfmarker> Yes . Maybe <disfmarker> Uh I I think I think <disfmarker> I'm here , I'm here . <vocalsound> something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . Yeah . Yeah . But even without it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . So , Well , I uh <disfmarker> I th we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , me too . Um Sebastian ? Me too . Yeah , I agree . Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . <vocalsound> Well , uh it can't be more spongy . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is <disfmarker> um can be <disfmarker> uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . Was it one of our options ? No , it's not one of our option , No . Uh No okay , this this was a most spongy option . <vocalsound> but when you look in the market , when you look <disfmarker> So , in the in <disfmarker> but but for the options given , it's the most spongy one . Uh yes , but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Yeah . Because we compare all these uh characteristics <disfmarker> characteristics with uh market <disfmarker> uh with with the real market . Yeah . Yeah . So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> They're out there . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . <vocalsound> Yes , but it's not good enough , Yeah . so it's a two . <vocalsound> I'll give it a one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I wan I'll take one . You take one ? What do you give it ? Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could <disfmarker> Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number . <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> yeah . Because we need to go on <disfmarker> in <disfmarker> for the time . Well , if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . It will be a one . <vocalsound> So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You are <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> okay . <vocalsound> The remote control offers enough features . <vocalsound> Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ? Well , the basic layout doesn't offem <disfmarker> offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Basically it's it's completely programmable . Yeah , depends . Yeah . You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode . Yeah , I know . So it's quite advanced . What what we didn't talk about is um uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but <vocalsound> it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's <disfmarker> If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is <disfmarker> it has all the features um a normal remote has . I think it has . Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat Yeah . Bec because you can um <disfmarker> we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . Yes . So , you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um <gap> <disfmarker> the the signals . Has uh the signals sent to it . Signal . Yeah . So you could uh uh uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to <disfmarker> as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . Absolutely . Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced . Yes . But that <disfmarker> that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . Yeah . Yeah . So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . You can use your voice to to programme it . Yep . It's <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the <disfmarker> for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one . I'll give a two . <vocalsound> Yeah , I'll give it a one . Um I think think a one , 'cause <gap> v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um <disfmarker> Yes . I I've <disfmarker> I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Yeah . So high quality , low acceptance . Hmm . The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . Yes . But <vocalsound> whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is <disfmarker> well , is not sure . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . D do you agree ? Yes , I agree . I <disfmarker> Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . Maybe we should have a radar uh <vocalsound> function . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yes . But we could <disfmarker> couldn't uh <disfmarker> what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? Twenty five Euros . Uh twenty five . And costs were twelve fifty . Yeah . But even now , if only our production costs w <vocalsound> uh were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was <disfmarker> were t uh was twenty two ? Mm-hmm . So uh <gap> selling price uh would be uh <disfmarker> M about fifty Euros . yeah . That's quite ex That's price , but w w well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality . No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh <disfmarker> Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes . Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders . Bu but <disfmarker> well <disfmarker> yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . Yes . Yes , but you can you c Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . And it's easier to use Yeah . because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition <gap> . and this one does . Yeah . So I think it's worth its price . Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh <vocalsound> with these ratings uh That's counting . Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that . should be about one point s seven , Four six seven eight . yeah . Okay . Nine divided by six . Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . Um <disfmarker> What did you think about uh the process , the project process ? Ruud ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Try to translate that . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm . <vocalsound> Any any other <disfmarker> Uh , Roo ? Well , Yeah , I think uh <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> Ye <vocalsound> Roo . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The process was good . But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . Yeah . And and that was the the big deal . Mm . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made Actually , we had <disfmarker> the the choice between <gap> what <disfmarker> Better decision . Yes . yeah . We had we had too little information actually . Yeah . So <disfmarker> And uh um the the the <disfmarker> well , looking at room for creativity , there was w way too <disfmarker> the the choice of components was way too narrow . Less . So there was not really a process of uh <disfmarker> Yeah . So we could we we could be <disfmarker> we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price . Well <disfmarker> Yes . The prices . Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . We we thought of possibilities <vocalsound> who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Yeah . We're tempered by that , yes . Okay , Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? No , no . Ruud ? I agree . You agree , okay . Uh leadership . Fantastic . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , <gap> okay . Okay . I think we're a good team . I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh <gap> . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Yes . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , but but si uh w w w <gap> <disfmarker> when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well . I think so too . Yeah . Yeah . Um the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? <vocalsound> Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . Yeah . It <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> Because of the response or <disfmarker> The response is very slow Response and <disfmarker> and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate . Okay . Uh it it has <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its <disfmarker> um uh where it uh <disfmarker> Draws . Yeah , where it draws . It's uh <disfmarker> the drawing on on the b on the board is <gap> r right from the pen . Okay , so it it had to be um better aligned , or what's the word ? So uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You to take in account that your <disfmarker> you m Uh yeah . yeah uh <disfmarker> Maybe it's <disfmarker> it needs to be calibrateds . It's too slow <disfmarker> It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . It is ? Okay . So uh it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , I think . Hmm . Okay . Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? No . Not at all . Not really . Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , I I think so too . although I would like to see um O_C_R_ . Yes . Yes . Yep . If it has O_C_R_ <vocalsound> , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . Yeah . It w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh <disfmarker> To digitise them . Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I type faster than I write . So <disfmarker> Yeah . But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . Yeah . Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy <disfmarker> it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . Yeah . I think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . Yeah . It's not quite uh ergonomic . Eco ergonomic . Economic . I know . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Um <disfmarker> What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No . so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> can't say much about it . <vocalsound> I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or <disfmarker> Yes . No , or the other way around . Yeah . Or the other way around , that you could show <disfmarker> but m Yes , yes . That's quite what PowerPoint does . But y you can <disfmarker> Yeah . if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . I know . I know , but <disfmarker> So it's almost <disfmarker> yeah . I know , but we couldn't use that feature , so I missed it . Yep . We weren't able to do that . At least the <disfmarker> um I wasn't explained how to do such a th Mm-hmm . <gap> . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object . An object , yes . Yes . The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . I it's not possible <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . And and uh w you were <disfmarker> when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . Yeah . And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's <disfmarker> Oh it looks like paint actually . Okay , so y it <disfmarker> it's not even as advanced as paint . Not not uh n not <gap> way . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's quite uh limited . Okay . Uh no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product . Okay . Oh , very good , celebration . Celebrate Pop uh pop up the champagne . <vocalsound> Great . <vocalsound> It was a privilege working with you . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Um you're dismissed . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , I think we are uh ready . Okay . To private rooms ? <vocalsound> I see some action over there . Private room , Roo . That sounds quite scary . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . No , let's find uh the way to <gap> . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> uh we're done , we're finished , <gap> I believe . So , are there any more cycles in this process ? I think not . I don't believe so . Well , maybe we'd <disfmarker> get an email . Thank you for your <disfmarker> But um how much time did we get for this meeting ? Forty minutes . And how much time is left ? A minute or or ten maybe . M Ten minutes . Yeah , ten or five . Okay . Okay . So , we can uh redesign our uh <disfmarker> Uh I would like to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box . And no added value . At all . No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market . So <disfmarker> Oh . But you see the problem , y you can't continue your uh your line . Yeah . Well , it's fluffy alright . <vocalsound> Spongy . What is that ? A giraffe ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It's a giraffe eating a <disfmarker> eating leaves from a tree . It's blue tongue . In interesting design . Yeah . <vocalsound> This is a new model . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Or blue tongue . <vocalsound> Blue tongue . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's spongy . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> That is uh <disfmarker> it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Blue tongue . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Right . Let's wrap it up . Yeah , we're done here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Gentlemen , thank you for your cooperation . Thank you Mister manager . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Now , <vocalsound> let's have uh a bottle of champagne . <vocalsound> <gap> . Leave it here . Yes . That's alright . <vocalsound> <gap> . <gap> . <gap>
<vocalsound> Okay . Good morning everybody . Good morning . Oh , everybody is not ready . Uh almost . Ready . Alright . Okay , let's go . So , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes . Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager . Um you are the <disfmarker> I'm uh Michael . I'm the user interface designer . Okay . Hi I'm Guillermo <gap> . I'm the Marketing Expert . And I am Hemant , the industrial designer . Okay , very good . Thanks for being here . Um so let's have a look to the the agenda . So , we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh <vocalsound> to make <disfmarker> to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . As usual we will follow the the project method um <vocalsound> that we are using in the <disfmarker> in our company . It is in three step as you know . First the functional design . The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings . So who want to start ? Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . Mister <gap> . Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . <vocalsound> Let's see . <vocalsound> Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um uh I think I have one in mind , so uh <disfmarker> You have one in mind ? <vocalsound> I'm gonna <vocalsound> <gap> about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . The spider has a <disfmarker> spider lives in a web <vocalsound> and uh it has eight legs , and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . There are some spiders that live in like <disfmarker> that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh <disfmarker> build a new web somewhere else . So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh <disfmarker> well it's actually a book first but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . So , that's my animal . Okay . Th thank you . Very interesting . <vocalsound> Guillermo you want to ? <vocalsound> 'kay <vocalsound> I dunno why , but <vocalsound> when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther <vocalsound> <vocalsound> not a pink panther , But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ? or maybe yes . <vocalsound> It would be very funny for us . Uh yeah yeah . So bad I don't like it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Okay it's a friendly panther . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone . Yeah maybe <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Um . Actually , honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour , I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh , I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , so <disfmarker> but <vocalsound> I like it because it's fast , and it's black as well , so it can he <disfmarker> it can hide itself very easily and it's it's <disfmarker> it looks like um <vocalsound> powerful , strong , uh I dunno . I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and <vocalsound> I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Thank you . Okay . Hemant . Um sure . <vocalsound> So you don't like pink panthers ? <vocalsound> I like it <vocalsound> . <gap> <gap> Oh yeah . Thanks . This lapel is coming out once in a while . It's not very strong . Okay . So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant . <vocalsound> I'll try to draw elephant <vocalsound> . It's a problem . Okay , thanks . Okay so , elephant goes like this , <gap> and then it has four feet <vocalsound> . I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but I think this is the easiest . And then we have it's trunk . And yep something like this <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> An eye , cute <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah , so <disfmarker> Poor elephant <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> and sometimes they have a hump . It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way <disfmarker> a different way of walking . So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . That's the way they walk . And that's very peculiar about them . None of the other animals walk like this . And they are very useful to human beings . At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . And they are found in um usually the warm countries . And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . That's what I know about them . So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants . So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ? There are two kind of uh yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are Indian and <disfmarker> So at some <disfmarker> for some elephants it's <disfmarker> the trunk is having one <disfmarker> Do we have some message there ? Yes . We have to <disfmarker> I have to catch you , Wind up sorry . ? Okay , some other time . We have to to go through the meeting . Okay . Thank you . Thank you <vocalsound> . We can discuss that off-line . <vocalsound> Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do <disfmarker> we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . Thanks . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about <disfmarker> so about finances . So <vocalsound> we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and uh we have um <vocalsound> <disfmarker> which which would generate a profit of of um <vocalsound> fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market . So could I just ask one question , um is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? O this is the <vocalsound> next topic we have to discuss exactly , Okay , alright . so let's go to it . So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? Should it be a universal one ? And uh etcetera . So um <vocalsound> so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go . Okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to <disfmarker> a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , but I guess if that's <disfmarker> if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually <disfmarker> you know , what people ar are willing to pay for <disfmarker> um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro Okay . because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , so it's <disfmarker> Okay I think this is more a job to our Marketing person . market person yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go . So we need to close the meeting . Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so <gap> the work every every of you ha have t d to do . So um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ? Yeah . Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . Thanks for coming today . Okay . Thanks . Thanks . Alright .
Wait for the marketing director actually , so . Anyways . Uh . See , shall we wait ? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever , so I'm gonna start soon , we have now <disfmarker> don't have much time anyway . Oh , there he is . Yes . Okay , There you are , we <disfmarker> Sorry , okay . a little bit of pl little problem with computer . Uh no problem . We're about to start , so have a seat . Okay , <vocalsound> <gap> . welcome again . Today , functional design phase . I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . Okay , that was just to get to know each other , Uh . have a little thoughts on what your vision is and <disfmarker> on this project , so <disfmarker> I put the minutes on the <disfmarker> I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there . I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . Anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you . Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after <disfmarker> over this later . But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . Who would like <disfmarker> wanna go first ? Yeah , sure , no problem . Go ahead . Take it . Um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Anyway , let's see what you have . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Okay , Uh it's still a bit open . I want to open the my s oh no . You should close it on your own notebook , I guess . Yeah . So there ? Oh no , that's okay . Okay . Uh slide show . Yes . The functional requirements , it's uh <vocalsound> uh very important for uh the user , he he wants to <disfmarker> yeah . The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use uh , um <vocalsound> we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important . Uh <disfmarker> If I can cut in , is it people or men ? <vocalsound> People , sorry . Is it people , okay . Both women and men , 'Cause I thought it was only men , so <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . Uh 'Kay . the findings um uh <vocalsound> seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um <disfmarker> That's pretty shocking uh . <vocalsound> So we have to s we have to do something about that . Yeah , and <disfmarker> yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use <disfmarker> yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only <disfmarker> So that's the most important things . Okay . Um <disfmarker> oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , Okay , but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . just talk ahead . It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh <vocalsound> to use . Mm-hmm . Uh less important is tel teletext , Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> uh um they use it , but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh Okay , that's okay . <vocalsound> and <disfmarker> but not important is the channel selection , the the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> hmm ? That's a little weird . Oh , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Which channel selection ? the the <disfmarker> no no no no no , that's very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings and uh <disfmarker> Okay , we can we can hide those under a menu or something , Oh , okay . Yeah . okay . <vocalsound> Um new preferences preferences . Uh um um beep to find your control , was <disfmarker> that was <gap> in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , That's like a button on your T_V_ ? Mm . Remote , okay . so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to <disfmarker> let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . Okay . And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ? <vocalsound> We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Is that manageable ? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . That sounds too <disfmarker> Yeah . It's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue . Okay . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh <disfmarker> so , the remote mu must see or um must um <vocalsound> see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , Okay , you don't set it yourself , so I can zap t to <disfmarker> it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . What ? You want the <disfmarker> you want it to be programmed , for example Yeah . y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? Yeah . Recognise <disfmarker> Let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , Yeah . so it recognises your favourite channel . Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like . Okay , so it's it it does <disfmarker> it recognise itself , you don't have to set it <disfmarker> No , Okay . itself . Maybe it's easier to <vocalsound> to sell it , but <disfmarker> Okay . I don't know it's manageable , but we will uh we will see . I see . Yeah , it's a little bit uh it's the end of it . It's a little bit uh I lost it , Okay . Okay . the computer uh crashed , <vocalsound> No problem , it's it's okay , so . that's <disfmarker> Shall I go ? Yeah , go ahead . Okay . Yeah . So , some technical functions . Darn computer . Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . Yeah . Uh let's just start with the method . <vocalsound> It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . We can do that . What goes wrong <vocalsound> at the user . Gets the remote control . Where is the remote control ? We've all had it once , I want to watch some television , Yeah . where's the remote control ? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , Yeah . That seems very good . a really good idea . Uh these are just the issues . I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . Searches for the button . There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . Mm uh . Mm-hmm . Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while . There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , Okay , so have it more <disfmarker> make it more durable actually . yes . Okay . Uh covered that . Oh yes , user presses the button . Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , Okay , so the buttons should be <disfmarker> so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Yeah . And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger Wow . The s Yeah . Make it <disfmarker> make them bigger . si Even more durable uh . So this is basically what I h had in mind in the <disfmarker> fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh <disfmarker> need to be replaced by others . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . This I pretty much covered . <vocalsound> So what we want to go to is not this one , but more <disfmarker> less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . Yeah , it's true . Yeah . So that's basically uh what I had in mind . Yeah , that's clear . This is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea . No , of course uh <disfmarker> Yeah . I must say that it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So Hmm . that was it . That was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere Yeah , I think it's a really good idea . and increase it <disfmarker> the durability of of the thing , so <disfmarker> Yeah . The other aspects , we'll just see how <disfmarker> what you came up with and what's possible for that budget . Yeah . Okay . Okay , that's fine . Um . Okay , now work a little with me . Okay . Well , let's start it as it is . <vocalsound> Okay , uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . Mm-hmm . And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me . Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's <vocalsound> why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . Mm-hmm . So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh <disfmarker> think of , it has to b to be built . So it's <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Of course , hmm . that's not as easy as it s might look like . Okay . Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper . You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . Exactly , Okay . so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . <vocalsound> Yeah , okay . So we have to <vocalsound> make something that's not too difficult in design again . So you have <disfmarker> This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh <vocalsound> uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv um <vocalsound> uh how to say it ? Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning . Mm-hmm . Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light . Okay . Okay . That was it ? <vocalsound> That was it . I'll get back to my thing then . Uh <disfmarker> Okay , back this up <disfmarker> to the screen . So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either <disfmarker> Well , I don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . Yeah . But I don't think it should be <vocalsound> very <disfmarker> it should be one of the big buttons for example . Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . It's not important anymore . Um we're targeting young people now , because our um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , Uh . which are <disfmarker> um the younger people were defined under forty . Yeah . Hmm . I so I think it's <disfmarker> B that's also good with the fashion and everything , so yeah . Yeah , and they want to pay for it and uh <disfmarker> They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . With more <disfmarker> Where <disfmarker> If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it . with more technical specifications Yeah . in the <disfmarker> <gap> <vocalsound> see how far we can go with it anyway , so Yeah . <disfmarker> And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently <vocalsound> black and yellow , but <disfmarker> I'm not sure if we <disfmarker> I think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So <disfmarker> With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your <disfmarker> Oh . I mean those cost hardly anything I think , Yeah . and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . Or we can sh for example we can make a different <vocalsound> <disfmarker> a basic design . And sell the covers separately , for example . That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . So you don't have to <disfmarker> I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . Mm-hmm . So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . Hmm . So just <disfmarker> I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . Yeah . Would you like to share ? No , I think this is a good idea . Okay . But <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> oh ? Is it manageable ? Is it easy ? Go ahead . Yeah , with with an L_C_D_ screen you can <disfmarker> Oh yeah . I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , Y Yes , I think so too . like you said . Why ? Yeah . I think for example it's it's huge <disfmarker> I think the L_C_D_ is huge , Nokia w it consumes batteries like hell . Uh . I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . And it costs too much to fabricate , It costs a lot , I think . so we're on a tight budget here . Okay , uh <disfmarker> Okay . What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , but y I'm not sure if it's even possible <vocalsound> . Mm . For example , a little T_V_ guide . Hmm . Like you have a little <disfmarker> just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing Mm-hmm . Yeah . so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . I'm not sure it's even possible , Hmm . I have to check that out , but maybe okay , make it <disfmarker> I'm not sure . Yeah , find a little compromise in that , but <disfmarker> Yeah . What did I write down ? I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ That must be possible . and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . I think it's easy to implement , Ja . we should go for that . I'm sorry , whe where do you wanna hit the T_ <disfmarker> you wanna <vocalsound> <disfmarker> And it's <disfmarker> Uh speech recognition . we want a button on the television . <gap> I thin <vocalsound> Yeah , I mean where else should you put it ? In th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control . Because that's not possible uh . Yeah , but <vocalsound> how are you gonna use that if your <disfmarker> I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press <disfmarker> where are you gonna press the button ? Uh . Yeah . Exactly . Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . A slap-on sticker . Oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . Mm uh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah , that could be possible . A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . Okay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal , If not <disfmarker> because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . Okay . Yeah . I think universal remote control should be possible . Um <disfmarker> Okay , Everyone uh wants to buy it , then I go for that . so we w Yeah , I think we're targeting everyone , Yeah . yeah . so remote <disfmarker> Okay . No , it's fine with me , but then I know what to look for . Okay , universal is good . Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do . Yeah . Or one . Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough , And it's <disfmarker> Yeah , but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever . right ? But <disfmarker> Oh yeah . Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that <vocalsound> is a problem in implementing this . It's <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . It's not a mature technology , <vocalsound> Okay . I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , It's a good idea , so <disfmarker> but it's just not <disfmarker> I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . Uh-huh . Yeah . What else do we have ? Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . Mm-hmm . So the the the symbols won't fade , maybe a little harder plastic Exactly . I already noted that . or especially li we don't <disfmarker> maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , Mm , okay . Okay . so those always fade first . Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . Hmm . Let's see . If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . That's fo <vocalsound> is For example ? uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . Well , we're not we're not targeting older people , Yeah . we should remember that . Everything we target is under forty , That's <disfmarker> okay , okay . so . You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're <disfmarker> Huh . The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , But b Uh okay . so <disfmarker> But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the <disfmarker> No , of course . No , I think it's just something you you put over them , because <disfmarker> Hmm . Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , But every <disfmarker> C tha that's not a that's not a bad <disfmarker> that's not even <disfmarker> that's a problem with the with the text then . it's not even a bad idea . <vocalsound> Hmm . I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could <disfmarker> For example , if your buttons are faded , after <disfmarker> I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . Mm . Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . Okay . <vocalsound> Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , So it's a good and a bad idea . so you don't have to change your whole cover . Mm-hmm . Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . Know what I mean ? Oh . Oh yeah , I know what you mean . It works the same as a Nokia telephone , it's it's in my uh <disfmarker> 'kay . Yeah , I know , it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , Yeah . Exactly . okay . Yeah , Yeah . that's what I <disfmarker> something I have to look into . Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier , Hmm . <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we <disfmarker> let's see we <disfmarker> So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . I want some <disfmarker> you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , Yeah . Yeah . because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with . Okay . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Yeah , I think user interface is fairly obvious . I mean it should be very intuitive , Pretty straightforward . s Yeah , it should speak for itself . Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , <vocalsound> and I'm <gap> total T_V_ new , anyway . So I think it should be <disfmarker> have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second <vocalsound> second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um <vocalsound> the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a <disfmarker> just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ . Mm . Is it techni technically possible to uh <vocalsound> send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , <vocalsound> Yeah . because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ? That is true . I don't think so . No , that's true . No , I don't think so . Because the television needs to respond to the signal , Yeah , that's true . It's an in-built menu , and if it doesn't know how , it's <disfmarker> isn't it ? Yes . Exactly , that's not possible . So basically we <disfmarker> I'm not sure if it's impossible , but uh there's a chance it's not , so . Or we could use a double-sided <disfmarker> for <vocalsound> less used functions you <disfmarker> A double-sided remote control ? Yeah , I don't think that's useful . with the cover . <vocalsound> I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , because <disfmarker> Yeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a <disfmarker> for a Sony that won't <disfmarker> for a Philips T_V_ . Hmm . No , but basic functions <disfmarker> Yeah . but functions which are not frequently used . Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , I don't think we should <disfmarker> Yeah , for exam so <disfmarker> Mm yeah . I'm not s yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that <disfmarker> it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings Mm . that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , Mm . but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . But that might be broken . I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh <disfmarker> <gap> Hmm . because usually the the menu is <disfmarker> the menu button is is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands , Hmm . Hmm . so . 'Cause everybody <disfmarker> I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , Hmm . so I think <disfmarker> I'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . Uh I think just a b Mm okay . <vocalsound> and the navigation is very basic , Mm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . it's usually the same thing . For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . Yeah . Yeah , that's true . I think so Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our <disfmarker> uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , Okay , just the way how to . I thi I think so too . Yeah , yeah . Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay . And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , Mm-hmm . and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . Yeah . Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , We should not do that . Exactly . because it's <disfmarker> either it's both <gap> mayb Yeah . Yeah , I have some ideas . I have some ideas . maybe the shape can be a little different . Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . Um <disfmarker> yeah . Mm that's your uh division . <vocalsound> And uh with different colours uh . So um <disfmarker> I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have . Yeah , this <gap> . Not sure what <disfmarker> Okay . because we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so . I heard a beep go . Yeah , but it wasn't me , it was him closing something . Yeah . So anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . I mean what do you want , do you want <gap> , but <disfmarker> Yeah , but we like some some curves or <disfmarker> Yeah , may maybe something like this . But though smooth inside . So you have the transmitter here for example . Yeah . Let's see that you <disfmarker> what would be handy . Uh . And a light uh <disfmarker> I think that the <vocalsound> the buttons should be <disfmarker> the channel buttons should be <vocalsound> uh on their own . Let's see one , two <disfmarker> God damn it . Oh , we get the general ideas , yes . Yeah , okay . <vocalsound> Another one here . Let's see what <disfmarker> I think this should <disfmarker> these are always on top of the of the control , Hmm . so they should be here . Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume <disfmarker> Think it's like this . <vocalsound> Volume . Withi within the <disfmarker> yeah yeah . Yeah , just take it . So you have the up channel <vocalsound> the down channel <disfmarker> the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? Do you take triangles or <disfmarker> Uh it's it's fine , I think . Um I think it should be I think it <vocalsound> <disfmarker> This is basically what people are accustomed to , Yeah . so <disfmarker> Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . Yeah , but this is just a g general idea . Oh d <gap> Yeah . Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . Yeah , in the middle . It's it's usually uh there , but <disfmarker> Whoa . Mm . Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you <disfmarker> if it's lost , for people that are deaf . They they won't hear the the beep . Yeah . Yeah , but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . You won't be able to find it . <vocalsound> Yeah . And flash takes up a lot of batteries again . Uh . Yeah , it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost . Just <disfmarker> Yeah . We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you <disfmarker> that some light lights up . So . And L_E_D_ uh on it . <gap> deaf people ? Yeah , I thought about for deaf people for example , so . We could do that . Just a light on it Uh let's see . or <disfmarker> So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button somewhere over here ? Oh yeah , it's true . Um that thing should be central . Very important . You shouldn't be <disfmarker> you uh shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . Oh , I usually press it on top . that's <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> At least that's what I'm accustomed to . Yeah . <vocalsound> I have another idea , Yeah , like that's gonna work . <vocalsound> I'm not sure if it's possible . And <disfmarker> What would you like to <gap> ? Yeah , I thought maybe we should move the buttons down But you r and put it here for example And you are reading from the t to <disfmarker> you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . From top to bottom . Yeah , that's true , Yeah , so it's <disfmarker> you should <disfmarker> Mm . I think the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do <vocalsound> , turn it on . Yeah . So power button on top . Um <disfmarker> Okay , mute button . Is that somewhere here ? Mute . Do we hardly <disfmarker> I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . Is that used often ? So i it's <disfmarker> sorry ? The mute button ? Do people use that often ? Mute . Turn the sound off . No , it's <disfmarker> no . <vocalsound> 'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it <vocalsound> right over here , at least in general , Uh . Hmm . but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I don't think it's important , It's not that important , no . <gap> but I think it I think it should be <disfmarker> you c you could put it somewhere here . Or or with the volume selection . <vocalsound> No , because it <disfmarker> Yeah , <vocalsound> Around uh not uh not at top at the <disfmarker> around the volume selection . people are accustomed to that , it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Can I have that ? I don't know where exactly , Sure . That's j but <disfmarker> Take this out and here see <disfmarker> Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? I'm drawing triangles , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , aren't they ? Yeah , it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . So anyway , I think this is <disfmarker> should be the channels and <disfmarker> or sh Wha Well , I'm accustomed to the channels being on top . No . Yeah . <vocalsound> Here , Yeah , me too . okay . Okay , Yeah , that's better . On the right . should we chan okay , <vocalsound> this two , channel up and down . Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every <disfmarker> Yeah . Well , for <disfmarker> that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it <disfmarker> Maybe it's more ex expensive . Mm , yeah . Maybe we should <disfmarker> what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . Uh . You have <disfmarker> just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , But that's already possible . because it's an it's it's it's very annoying . But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? Yeah . I'm not sure y <vocalsound> I'm not sure it's <disfmarker> if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . Because if <disfmarker> it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable , <gap> Yes . but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . Yes . Okay . Uh you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it <disfmarker> you're <disfmarker> I think I have a nice idea . the remote also can act as a recharger . So then you can choose , you have every decision . Know what I mean ? Not exactly uh . You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , Hmm . but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . Yeah yeah . I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea So <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> to have uh like sort of a <disfmarker> maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it . Yeah , that's g But I think that will cost a lot . Uh a normal wire would be better . I'm not sure . Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , A what ? you don't need basic station . Well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal Yes . or <disfmarker> So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . That is possible , that's true . It could be very flat , But <disfmarker> Which <disfmarker> could be very small . It's a very small <disfmarker> Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but <disfmarker> So you can put your remote on flat for example . Mm . Yeah . And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole Yeah . for example um you just <vocalsound> put it down , it recharges for example . Yeah . I don't think it's very expensive . But again , isn't that too expensive ? Yeah . <vocalsound> 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station <disfmarker> I'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r Mm . That's that you <disfmarker> that's what you buy yourself . Yes . I'm going to try to find that out . I'm not sure if there's information available on this , It's just an idea , But <disfmarker> we have to find out if it's possible . but <disfmarker> And do people actually want that ? To pay extra <disfmarker> they want to pay for rechargeable ? Yeah , they want to pay for it . Do they want <disfmarker> but they want a rechargeable one ? Yeah . I'm not sure , you should find out if it's <disfmarker> if rechargeable is important . Th uh there was not a el ask esque <vocalsound> Hmm . These are uh comfort issues . Yeah . But <disfmarker> So I think people will pay <disfmarker> they wanted to pay for comfort . Well , this is comfort . They want to pay for comfort , we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , But f hmm . Yes . um and <disfmarker> Yeah , we have to <disfmarker> either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . Hmm . Yeah . Exactly . I think this is a brilliant product . I would buy it myself . <vocalsound> I think it would be good actually . I like the beep part <vocalsound> anyway . <vocalsound> Uh . So um <vocalsound> let's go through the <disfmarker> I like the covers . That's a brilliant idea . <vocalsound> Can can we save this or <disfmarker> I never thought <disfmarker> Covers is covers is good . Yeah , it's <disfmarker> Oh we can save this . Up and saved . We even saved the ant . <vocalsound> <gap> Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . So <vocalsound> what we have is <disfmarker> you have <disfmarker> I think you have <vocalsound> to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . I hope if I have information about that , Maybe <disfmarker> I'm gonna <disfmarker> yeah , or <vocalsound> maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . Yeah . Yeah . We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , <gap> Yeah , okay . but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , Yeah yeah yeah . because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , Mm . <vocalsound> Yeah . uh we just have to see what it looks like . Yeah . I would like to make a decision <gap> . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it <vocalsound> Yeah , if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , and <disfmarker> exactly , I need it . so . Hmm . <vocalsound> Could you post some <vocalsound> other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . You seem to have information on that , I'd like to uh see some of it . Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ? No , it wasn't wasn't allo No , it's not . No . Not <gap> . it was possible , not allowed , so . So that's um why I'm not sure that <vocalsound> you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . Yeah . My computer crashed , so uh Yeah , okay . I don't care . I lost my uh presentation , I haven't heard any complaints yet , Oh , your computer . Okay . so . Um <disfmarker> but I have the uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that . Yeah , but I Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our internet , Let's see . Yeah , the oh , they inc uh and here is my they include the new one . <vocalsound> Or just for you . Oh , where would we <disfmarker> here is my marketing report , maybe you ca you can look at uh <vocalsound> that <vocalsound> Oh no , I didn't have that . and <disfmarker> Where would we want the uh teletext button ? Ah yeah . Because we decided that it's n not that important . And one <disfmarker> All it tells <gap> just <disfmarker> let's make make a new <disfmarker> Do we put it somewhere over here ? tick the new one . <vocalsound> Um other side . Yeah , let's increase it a little because <disfmarker> And uh wha what people want , I've uh Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas . Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible <disfmarker> I have another thing uh <disfmarker> just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , Yeah . so the more <disfmarker> less important <disfmarker> Well , we have decided <vocalsound> more or less the basic structure . More or less . I can put the other buttons in <disfmarker> Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down Yeah . and we'll see what looks best . What uh what did you wanna say ? Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , Maybe another idea uh . but it it's also for people , <vocalsound> they want to learn it fast , not uh <disfmarker> they want to <disfmarker> Mm . Mm . Yeah , so we don't want <gap> we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . No Mm . It's <disfmarker> yeah , it's easy to learn Yes , but it should cover all the functions , wi and uh <disfmarker> so possibly , just an idea that popped in <disfmarker> Well what <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> we had function that what people do , so . People change channels , people <vocalsound> <disfmarker> they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . That's the basic fu that's what you do <disfmarker> I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented . Yeah , And <disfmarker> The <disfmarker> If <disfmarker> but we could go a step further , because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . That's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button . Everything is <disfmarker> you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu . Yes , but it <disfmarker> But that's the question , Because we're making <disfmarker> is it ? Um <disfmarker> Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . Yeah , but <disfmarker> If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . We need to adjust to the <vocalsound> technology . But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . I think so too . I think so too . True . Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? If you rule out functions , then uh <disfmarker> and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . <gap> Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . <vocalsound> No , I thi If um <disfmarker> That's a bad bad com <vocalsound> commercial Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with . for <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh <vocalsound> younger than forty . okay . Under forty . Yeah ? That's true . Um on my report , <vocalsound> I didn't uh <vocalsound> ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , Mm-hmm . because my computer crashed . Yeah yeah . Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Hmm . Hmm . The want to pay for <disfmarker> So Oh . <vocalsound> Did they really said it like that ? Those two things . i yeah . Yeah , and <disfmarker> Do they realise how much that costs ? <vocalsound> Uh shall we ? That's almost undoable . Yeah . Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . Younger , age sixteen and forty five . <vocalsound> Uh but <disfmarker> That's all here , here it says <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , that's that's <gap> . Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price . Yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . If if they <disfmarker> Okay , so we're not focusing on this . Um <disfmarker> All the interest in features , not really the L_C_ <disfmarker> oh here . Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . Hmm , okay ? <vocalsound> Yeah , that's true . So uh <vocalsound> we can Speech recognition is quite <disfmarker> We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , I dunno . Yeah . because if <disfmarker> apparently it's what people want , Hmm . How much it will cost it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , Uh . and <disfmarker> maybe it's not even that expensive . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or <disfmarker> for some extra information on it , on your programmes . Uh I <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Well I doubt it , but <disfmarker> But I really need finance information . Me too . <vocalsound> I mean we all do . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It will come uh <disfmarker> We all do . <vocalsound> Right . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . Mm . We should see if <disfmarker> what it costs , if it's possible . Uh . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . Even if you put it <disfmarker> even if you put a different cover on it , it looks <disfmarker> still looks boring , <vocalsound> Different colours maybe . so . Hmm . And the design , it should differ . But all <disfmarker> This is Philips , huh ? Philips has this . I have no clue . Well , I just drew something what <disfmarker> which would fit into your hand easily . I had basically <disfmarker> Okay . Hmm . Uh . Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic . Mm . Oh , I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , I think it's a very <disfmarker> because I need to put all the electronics in it . Sorry ? If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , Yeah ? because I have to put all the electronics in it . Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . Okay . I mean we can stick it in in there , I think . No . Huh So what kind of <disfmarker> even if <disfmarker> in the worst case we can even <disfmarker> Could you give me the pen back ? Yeah , sure . So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . Let's take take the basic design again , what we <disfmarker> oh , crap <disfmarker> uh came up with . I'll just make it a little bigger now . So a transmitter here . Anyway . We could <disfmarker> let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . So then we should probably put it here . <vocalsound> It doesn't have to be really big , but just just have to be <disfmarker> has to be there . Hmm . Think it's a good place , people don't <disfmarker> If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . No ? It's not that uh <disfmarker> it's not the most important function , Me too . It's j <vocalsound> it's just an extra thing , Ah it just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it , <vocalsound> I think it's very important to use it , you press the buttons on top , but <gap> . because your finger is on top . uh because it's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> use it uh How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? But nee the function of it . <vocalsound> So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot <disfmarker> it costs a lot . So <disfmarker> Yeah , but why I <disfmarker> I'm not sure . Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand . Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , Hmm . No . ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . M I personally would prefer it on the top . I'm <disfmarker> You would prefer it Yeah . n Okay . Huh . So we have three people saying it should be on top . Okay , But it <disfmarker> but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . Hmm . Anyways . It's expensive to build it , so Mm . Uh this looks a little <disfmarker> you must use the maximum of it . I'm still not convinced of the <disfmarker> About the L_C_D_s thing . Yeah . Hmm . Well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , They want it uh . because it's it's cool . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . Huh . Uh . But uh <disfmarker> Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . So I have to look if that's possible . Yeah , I know uh . But if we <disfmarker> So basically <disfmarker> can I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh we have green now uh <disfmarker> what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ? In middle of it . Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit <disfmarker> that has it on on on the bottom . In the middle . Maybe in a circle for example , like we <disfmarker> like in this example . I think this is not good , but for <disfmarker> we could make circular buttons for example . For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , Hmm . Yes , but we do agree that we <vocalsound> keep this at the centre , because it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . because it's basically the most important function . I think the channel button should be in the centre . It's the most import yeah . Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . Because it's uh <disfmarker> Well , that would make them quite small . We're not sure about the size anyway , So maybe you'd put them here . just a general design . You can make it as big as you want . For example if you take uh <disfmarker> Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . Hmm . No , let's see . For example just <disfmarker> If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . Yeah . <gap> . That might be an option . I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely . Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . Yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . But it has to be a little bit heavier . Okay . The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big . <gap> <disfmarker> No , but the things behind it . <gap> space . Mm let's see . Like a process uh . Finish meeting now . It's on your computer . Finish meeting now . Okay , we will . So would we like this So either <disfmarker> or would we like the <disfmarker> We either we have to decide what what people want . I like this one more . Either this one , this this could be the luxurious one . So we have channel buttons here . I'm just drawing something uh . Uh <disfmarker> I think this would this would look cool . You could have it for example <disfmarker> small buttons here for some extra functions , Uh . so if your basic function's here , we should <disfmarker> like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . Mm . Let's see what we have here . Or <disfmarker> And uh what about speech recognition uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well you can just <disfmarker> no , I'm not sure if we can do that , Yeah , yeah , but we could put a microphone in here for example . but <disfmarker> or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech . Mm . I think it's <disfmarker> L_C_D_ is better now . Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . Yeah . I'll try to . Yeah . But let's cut the meeting for now yes . One more uh thing I'd like to say , uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . Okay . Yeah , okay , yeah , Shall we all try uh to think about a name ? So I think of a name . that's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> yeah , that's okay . Yeah , let's think of a name , okay . Uh okay . Oh , good . Okay , at anyways , So <disfmarker> the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go uh . Yes , go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch . <vocalsound> Yeah . Good luck . Yeah , to all . Same . Yeah . <gap> Yeah , I've <disfmarker> Do we uh save the <gap> ? <gap> <gap> . <gap> .
Hi . Hi . Hello . <vocalsound> Oh . Good morning . Good morning . Morning . Good morning . Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in , uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother . So um <disfmarker> By Big Brother ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . This uh <disfmarker> These are cameras , so are these . Mm-hmm . This thing uh that looks like a pie , are actually all microphones . Yeah . Okay . So you must be careful with uh with uh all this . And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be . And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras . Of our faces . And <disfmarker> Indeed . <vocalsound> So they can see our faces . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Welcome at the kick-off meeting . My name is uh Danny Wolfs . <vocalsound> Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . <vocalsound> Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ? I'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer . User interface , okay . Hi , my name's uh <gap> . I'm the Industrial Designer . Industrial , yes . I'm uh Tim <gap> . Um my function is the Marketing Expert . Okay , thank you . First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh <disfmarker> Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ? <vocalsound> And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of <disfmarker> If it's uh it's possible technical-wise . <vocalsound> Uh each stage is uh <vocalsound> uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward . <vocalsound> Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . <vocalsound> This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . <vocalsound> This is called a smart board <vocalsound> Speaks for itself . thing uh <disfmarker> Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> This uh is <gap> very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all , <vocalsound> because I think you know uh how it works . Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh little uh little <vocalsound> kinda exercise to uh know each other . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . Uh important is that we use different colours , <vocalsound> and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths . I have a question . Yes ? Um this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it , Yeah . <vocalsound> or uh did you just make it up yourself ? No no no . It's uh it's uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I I It's part of the introduction , I must do it . Yeah , yeah , yeah . okay . 'Cause we uh really don't know each other , and uh it's kinda new . So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff . Okay . <vocalsound> That kind of thing . Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ? Um , yeah . I don't know really how it works . But maybe you can show us first ? <vocalsound> Okay , okay . Yeah , okay . Drawing goes with uh this thing . Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . That's uh important . <vocalsound> So hold it uh like this . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You g you get electrocuted or <disfmarker> Yeah , kinda . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , <vocalsound> um <disfmarker> You must p p uh push a little uh <disfmarker> Good . Because <disfmarker> And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . It's not uh fully real-time , so uh watch it . Ach . <gap> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Well I'm gonna paint in the red . Ooph . Oh . <vocalsound> That's the background colour . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , undo . Um <disfmarker> The pen ? No . One minute please . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , that's the one . Well , five . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> My favourite animal huh ? <vocalsound> It's like Pictionary ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , you can guess what it is . The the one who says it first <vocalsound> gets a raise . <vocalsound> May uh paint uh next . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a pork ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , it's not an orc . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You don't see it uh at the ears ? Mm yeah , I have it at home . <vocalsound> You have an orc at home ? Very artistic . <vocalsound> Thank you . <vocalsound> So it's a cat . <vocalsound> What's it called ? Simba . Ah . 'Cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called Simba . 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Miniature size ? So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion . Okay . <vocalsound> He's happy with us , so uh he's smiling . Wow . He does have body uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Huh . No , only the face . Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . Okay . So we uh <disfmarker> We have to speed up . Yeah . Remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths . Yeah . Okay , who wants to go next ? I <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah ? <vocalsound> So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a <disfmarker> You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing . Save it . Or <disfmarker> Yeah . You have to save it . Save it , okay . I've done it . <vocalsound> New ? 'Kay . You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh <disfmarker> Mm uh <disfmarker> Not really . Kind of firm touch . <vocalsound> That one . Oh . Uh hmm . Yeah ? Okay . Open . Which one is it ? Smart board ? Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . And now ? Okay . Okay , thanks . 'Kay , I've speed up . 'Kay , that's fine . Line width . By the way , why was your cat uh red ? Because uh my cat is red uh at home . Oh , okay . <vocalsound> Oh . And I have red hair , <vocalsound> Oh , yeah , sure . so uh must be red . It's a very bloody cat . It's a frog . <vocalsound> No , it's a turtle . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh it's an apple . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's not an apple . Must be a dog . <vocalsound> A dog ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Hmm . Colour . <vocalsound> Something like this . Smaller . <vocalsound> Huh ? <vocalsound> Oh , it is a turtle . It is a turtle . Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ? Um <disfmarker> 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You watched it a lot ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh ? You watched it a lot ? It's uh inside its shell . You'll be uh finished sooner . No , it's uh <disfmarker> It's a scared turtle . No no . <vocalsound> It's coming up . Mm . Uh . Wow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , Tim . Thank you . <vocalsound> Something like this . <vocalsound> Okay , you know <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very artistic . Jurgen , you want to go next ? Yes <gap> . Okay . Yeah ? Wha Thank you . Here you go . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> How did it work ? Format ? Performance ? And then you have the the current colour , you can change . So no red or green . And a pen ? And uh line uh width . <vocalsound> I had five . Tim had <disfmarker> Uh Tim , what kinda line width did you have ? Um <disfmarker> Uh the big lines were like nine . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . It's a dog . Well , <vocalsound> Uh . very good . <vocalsound> I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one . Okay . Why a dog ? You have a dog at home ? Well , we had a dog , a few years ago . Uh , it's p Had a dog ? Yeah ? And and it , <gap> yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something . Ah . It's pretty good uh <disfmarker> But uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You have an artistic uh inner middle . <gap> <vocalsound> An artist . <gap> <vocalsound> Uh a Graphical User Designer , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Hmm . Hey . Think you uh picked the wrong uh function . Wrong job . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> No . Can work together . Ah colour . So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . Not difficult at all . Wha <vocalsound> Well , it's okay <gap> . Okay , thank you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's enough , <vocalsound> thanks . <vocalsound> Janus ? The last one ? Yeah , sure . Yeah . Uh thanks . I wonder . Yeah . <vocalsound> After a cat , a turtle and a dog . <vocalsound> I think he's gonna draw an elephant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I figure I should do something like that , but I'm gonna do something much more difficult . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh-oh . Uh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic <gap> design . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm gonna design a remote uh <vocalsound> remote control animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Remote control animal . <vocalsound> Exactly . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sorry . Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh . Yeah . <gap> That that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and <disfmarker> No . I think it's easier to draw . Better to draw with a with <disfmarker> Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse . Than on the , with <disfmarker> Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mouth . Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive . <vocalsound> But what is he uh ? Too expensive , yeah . Is it a rabbit ? Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do you have a rabbit at home ? No . It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? <vocalsound> A green rabbit . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix . Yeah , exactly . <vocalsound> Okay , then yeah . There , the g white green rabbit . So . <vocalsound> He's a little bit stoned there . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit . Yeah . It will do . Uh uh <disfmarker> Uh well . Okay . Finishing touch and then we're going further . <vocalsound> Project Manager ? Uh <disfmarker> Yeah ? Where does the pen go ? Just uh <disfmarker> Have you been uh counting the time ? Yeah , a little . <vocalsound> Okay . Let's go on then . Well , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic . Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Don't choose for youself . <vocalsound> Oh , sorry . <vocalsound> That's selfish . Okay , It's pretty abstract . now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . <vocalsound> Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . So that's a lot . We have to sell uh a lot of uh <disfmarker> Yeah , how much is it ? Like how much ? Hundred million uh remotes or something ? Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . Oh yeah . Twenty million . Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah . But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table . <vocalsound> Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh <disfmarker> Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and <disfmarker> Or just only <disfmarker> Yeah . I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ? If you have them on uh <disfmarker> I can uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , I can find <disfmarker> Uh . Okay . Oh , in case you want it <disfmarker> This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Screen ? Yeah , be The screens . Okay . Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ? <vocalsound> No no no . Only <disfmarker> All the drawings go there , at the left uh <disfmarker> Uh but um which <disfmarker> <gap> The ones we made on the <disfmarker> Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . Oh , only in Word , okay . Yeah . Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view . Yeah . Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Five minutes . Five minutes ? Okay , Yeah . I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . Yeah . Yeah . And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products . Mm-hmm . Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um <vocalsound> think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . Okay . Okay . That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um <disfmarker> And something like an L_C_D_ screen . For what purpose ? Um uh like I said here um <disfmarker> Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , <vocalsound> when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or <disfmarker> Okay . So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh From my point of view , yeah . remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? Yeah , it has to be uh <disfmarker> Yeah , our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things . Yeah . So yeah , <vocalsound> We <disfmarker> So i i i i I I agree with you . So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to <disfmarker> To the current market . Yeah . Look , <vocalsound> you got some cheap uh remote controls there . They just uh <disfmarker> Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em . No . But when you enter a new market with a remote control and Mm-hmm . uh wanna gain market share Yeah . you have to do something special , I think . Yeah . But we have to keep an eye that it's <disfmarker> Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh <disfmarker> Yeah , of course . And and the price . <gap> But it's <disfmarker> But but this is just from marketing uh aspect . Yeah okay . Yeah . Okay . I don't know anything about user interface or <vocalsound> design . <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> And that's because we have him . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And and him . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And him . <vocalsound> Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um <vocalsound> the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . <vocalsound> Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So Yeah . Um that's the thing we uh discussed . one thing uh , Yeah ? we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we <disfmarker> Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh <disfmarker> We should have some agreement on that before we <disfmarker> Okay . Um wha <vocalsound> Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh <disfmarker> I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . I think th that's a pha Yeah . That's a phase further . Okay . Yeah . Ju just uh make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . Ah okay . And and then we can plan <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . We can plan further , I think . Yeah . But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh <disfmarker> How do you call it ? Uh <disfmarker> Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Uh I think that's well uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Will come in handy . Mm yeah . I don't know . Yeah . You decide . <vocalsound> Okay . You're the Project Manager . W <vocalsound> He says <disfmarker> if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . Yeah . Or do we use it a text screen ? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or <disfmarker> Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh <vocalsound> is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a <disfmarker> Okay . Mm-hmm . Uh tha that's a same step further . Yeah , actually it is . Why ? Yeah . Why ? <vocalsound> Then looking at individual components , Uh . so that's actually a f step further . Yeah . Yeah . Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide Yeah . Yeah , we can take it from there . w what it's gonna be . Yeah , I agree uh , Okay . A we can take it from there . And then you s then you can delete uh Or edit . the o the obsolete uh details . Okay . So uh I think . each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . Yeah . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . Yeah . I must finish off now , so it's over . You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . And I see you in uh thirty minutes . Okay , Okay . Thank you . cheers . Sorry . <vocalsound> Be careful . Damn . Yes . Success ? <vocalsound> Yeah . No . Come up .
<vocalsound> Okay ? Good afternoon . Hope you have good lunch . Afternoon . Hi . Yeah , we had falafel . Oh . Nice . And you ? Uh , yes , I had something similar but non-vegetarian . <vocalsound> Okay . So today is um our third meeting . It will be about the conceptual design <vocalsound> uh . If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings um . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us . So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts ? Okay , <gap> . So marketing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you are <disfmarker> you saved your y your presentation somewhere ? Yep . So you're four ? Four , yeah . Which is trend watch . <vocalsound> Okay . Mr Marketing Experts . Yeah that's me . So <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh . Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users . Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current the n current trends ? Yeah . Yeah ? Mm-hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> <gap> Okay . <vocalsound> Well wha <vocalsound> what I found <disfmarker> um can you <disfmarker> Next slide ? Yeah . Yeah . Thank you . What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most <disfmarker> what they what they find more more interesting , more <disfmarker> or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . <vocalsound> So now more more cool aspect , ma more <disfmarker> a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with <disfmarker> instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . Okay . Uh also <disfmarker> Well <vocalsound> in in Euro in in Paris and and <vocalsound> Milan the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of <gap> uh of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's <vocalsound> it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . <vocalsound> Mm . And also <vocalsound> in the in the U_S_A_ the the current <disfmarker> the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . Spongy means eponge ? Mm-hmm . So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so <disfmarker> What what do you mean by <vocalsound> fruit and vegetables and spongy ? <vocalsound> What <disfmarker> you mean clothe Spongy means it it's like sp Fruit vegetables is the the new <disfmarker> have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? No , I missed that one . Yeah , I I didn't miss an <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . Oh , they're <disfmarker> okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . No no , not not yet , not yet . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , So te textu textures , yeah . just maybe <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Vegetable textures and all this kind . Drawings of bananas . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh <vocalsound> Okay and <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Uh-huh . yeah , yeah . But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? Well so this is in the next slide certainly . Uh no no , it's not . It's not ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So which fruit are you thinking of ? And <disfmarker> Um . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may <disfmarker> could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something . Mm-hmm . But yeah it it depends on the <disfmarker> So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . <vocalsound> Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the <disfmarker> <gap> Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , Yeah maybe the shape the shape <disfmarker> buttons are in the frape <disfmarker> shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . Apple for channel one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . So we shouldn't be at re really attached to to the trend So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> For instance , yeah . African or as an elephant ? That we can discuss afterwards <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . But <disfmarker> okay , I'm not , I'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices To fruit ? and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was <vocalsound> was was able to to buy a a n a cooler remote control . But is it uh is fruit cool ? What ? That's a question . What ? Is fruit cool ? Yeah ? Uh <disfmarker> Is the new trend of the <disfmarker> Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , <vocalsound> imagi <vocalsound> <vocalsound> just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool . <vocalsound> No I think we we should think about a a shape with it <disfmarker> a device with a shape of some <disfmarker> Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . <vocalsound> Yeah . Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , Banana . a cucumber . Mm-hmm . I dunno . Or m Maybe too long . Maybe . Too green . Maybe . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , but I mean you also have to <disfmarker> you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and <disfmarker> you know . A banana . Um <disfmarker> It's , it <disfmarker> Yeah . The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like <gap> on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't th it will be rolling a lot . Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so Okay . Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough <disfmarker> a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also . Yeah . Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . Well , this is <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , <vocalsound> so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than <disfmarker> rather than the <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> So you you you suggest to go f new inputs and also it's <disfmarker> I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need <disfmarker> buying control remote , buying uh Okay . <vocalsound> S so you're simply more things . It's not so simple . you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons <disfmarker> with only a few buttons . For instance , yeah . Yeah for for for <disfmarker> given an an example yeah . <vocalsound> Okay good . So maybe you can go ahead ? Yeah no , it's what I already said . Okay . <vocalsound> Thanks . Um . Okay , I'll give the floor . So you are User Interface guy . Okay . So you're three ? Yeah . And it's this one . Yep . Go for it . <vocalsound> Yep . Okay . So . S next uh slide . Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control <vocalsound> . But it's just a speaker right ? It's <disfmarker> no , what it is , it's it's very <disfmarker> It's not a microphone . It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it's got a little chip and it allows you t Mm-hmm . Actually I'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it <gap> just to speak to you . Well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . Sample sensor sample speaker . It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . Okay . So , I mean , you know , I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . But basically the thing is , we have this technology available In-house . in-house . So , um Mm-hmm . but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . so um it it <disfmarker> but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it , <gap> <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> there's something that I <disfmarker> unclear really understanding . Is this a technology that recognize keywords <disfmarker> speech keywords ? It's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , you say <disfmarker> the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um <disfmarker> well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? And it's just to , it's just to playback something ? Yeah . So actually that was a bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . Yeah yeah . So this is not s really to do to to do control . Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an Yeah . This is just more like a poi pois yeah . It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , Yeah yeah . but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh <disfmarker> So it it's c uh it it Yeah but you can u it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to <disfmarker> we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh Completely pointless yeah . <disfmarker> yeah comp <vocalsound> completely pointless <vocalsound> for the inter for <disfmarker> from the interaction point of v point of view <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control . Okay . Yeah but the <disfmarker> can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? <vocalsound> Well yeah , that's the thing , if <disfmarker> you can but <vocalsound> you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . Yeah yeah . So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . Mm-hmm . So <disfmarker> Yeah , that would be some development work . So this is out of discussion . Yeah . So if if if it is something that you can <disfmarker> we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control <disfmarker> M Mando . <vocalsound> Banana-mando . No this is mm banana-bando , yeah . Banana-mando yeah . <vocalsound> Banana-man <vocalsound> Uh then it could be cool yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah okay , let's go ahead . Okay . I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so <disfmarker> Okay . Um , yeah . So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our <vocalsound> potential funky-looking uh remote control <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It doesn't look like a banana at all . Well , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , Yeah . um , so at the moment it's more of a box focus . <vocalsound> Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , Stable thing , that's right . To have <gap> , I think everyone has has agreed that it's <disfmarker> that it could be quite a useful um thing , so . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , Mm . because it's it's <disfmarker> the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <vocalsound> But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , What's a turbo button ? and <disfmarker> well <vocalsound> so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh <disfmarker> Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing <gap> . It con it controls the speed ? Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going <disfmarker> if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote , Mm-hmm . but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana It's enough . and it's still very <disfmarker> it may even be for most <disfmarker> for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , um <vocalsound> you know , what other buttons do we want ? Mm-hmm . I mean we could have <disfmarker> well , I guess you need an on and off switch , Switch on . Yeah . but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . Yeah . So sounds crazy . I like crazy ideas . <vocalsound> That's why you're a marketing guru . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , of course . <vocalsound> So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . Well , that's the thing , as <disfmarker> have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five Euro ? I think that <disfmarker> Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro . I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . No we can we can't use that . You <disfmarker> we can ? We can't . We can't use that to Communicate . to comman co communicate , it's just a thing <disfmarker> Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . It's one way . No . No ? But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to to recognize <disfmarker> It's not a lot one hundred templates , Mm-hmm . Mm . it's not <disfmarker> Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our <gap> can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . Yeah . Ah , it's designed for a cof <vocalsound> okay . Is it design for a coffee machine ? Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Maybe you could ask your <disfmarker> the <disfmarker> you could ask the engineering department if we can <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . A good good good thing . But uh <disfmarker> You want to g to move to your slides ? Yeah , that's right , yeah . You're finished ? Well I just I just made the point , I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment . Yeah I think so . But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control Yeah . and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . Mm-hmm . It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition <disfmarker> the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here Mm . Exactly yeah . but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out . It's speech <disfmarker> It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Oh , good idea . Yeah . That's right . yeah . Very good . Okay , let's move on . So you're two ? That's right . Okay . So this is going to be about the component design . Mm-hmm . So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your <disfmarker> if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . Yeah . Yeah . So there should <disfmarker> we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . So , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . 'cause I'm not sure <disfmarker> So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is . Okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ? So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . Okay . These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , Yeah . it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's <disfmarker> Although , you know , wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option , if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on . Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be <disfmarker> Wooden cases <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well it depends , I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , Yeah but the components inside . it's the inside . Yeah but inside you know you could have <disfmarker> you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Very <disfmarker> too expensive to do . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . And also uh <disfmarker> Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . That's true , but are we set on the banana idea ? <vocalsound> Actually Well it look like <disfmarker> it looks like you are all targeting that I was thinking that the <vocalsound> yeah ? the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . Yes it is . <vocalsound> Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This <disfmarker> Is it an e apple which has <disfmarker> it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . It's like a pumpkin or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah ? Pumpkin . Green . Green . Green . Um um um , yes I see . What does it taste like ? And you put in the salad . Pep pepperoni . Um Ah yeah , is it <disfmarker> what's it in French ? Poivron . Oui c'est ca Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . Yeah . Uh pepper . Pepper . But um they do d And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like No , I mean in a <disfmarker> Yeah . It's not re it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> like with a banana you can have <disfmarker> you you think it's really fancy and fun ? You think that young people that are <disfmarker> I'm sure it's fun . <vocalsound> Yeah . More than a banana ? But banana is not so handy , Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> I think that's handier . But <gap> like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just Yeah . roll it back and forth like that , It's kind it's kind of <disfmarker> it's more uh <disfmarker> but with uh <disfmarker> I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to <vocalsound> to put the controls . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay let's move on . Yeah you're right . So time is running , let's move on . Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just <disfmarker> and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that . Okay . Yeah , we can go to the next slide . Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . So we can have regular chip for control . Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . And uh regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of <disfmarker> It could be a beep kind of thing . Okay , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? Yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip , Okay . most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that . Okay . So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ? That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . It should be <disfmarker> whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside . Okay . Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker . Mm-hmm . Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . Yeah . As <disfmarker> or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , Yeah . so that <disfmarker> So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside . That's right . Okay . Yeah . So these these were the component selection and these things . We can go to the next slide . And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device <disfmarker> wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . Although , if <disfmarker> It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . Mm . Of fruits . Mm-hmm . Cause that , you know , that <disfmarker> sometimes people like to collect um you know things that <disfmarker> of a similar type . <vocalsound> Remotes S objects . <disfmarker> objects , okay . Crazy objects . I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . Well , <vocalsound> you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place . No but I think just one fruit to control everything . Like a power fruit . A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . and we should have it on the remote . Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . Well <disfmarker> Okay , good . So you're having a basis station . Okay . Your <disfmarker> usually your remote sits on that . So you <disfmarker> and it's <disfmarker> that's why it can have chargeable batteries . Now let's say <disfmarker> So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . Bu it's it's <gap> . Basis station is with the thing . You s you you <gap> thing . It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think that's a pretty handy feature . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's kind of <disfmarker> people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget . <gap> So <disfmarker> Uh this is <disfmarker> basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote . That's right . But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . <gap> So component cost is going to be the least . Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . Okay . And <disfmarker> I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I <disfmarker> this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like <disfmarker> it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . And um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . <vocalsound> For better <disfmarker> want of a better word you know ? You think that yellow it's kitsch . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Well , you know , I don I don't know how many peop <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . Yeah . No , I I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> A <disfmarker> yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . <vocalsound> Well they <disfmarker> O otherwise <disfmarker> Maybe li like that . It's neither a banana nor a <disfmarker> Yeah , like this colour this colour <disfmarker> Maybe , you know , maybe <disfmarker> like still in the shape of a banana . Roughly . <vocalsound> No , exactly . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Exactly . Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know <disfmarker> because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make <disfmarker> um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . Yeah . Okay . Let's move on . And uh going to the last slide . Uh uh <disfmarker> yeah . Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . Okay . Go for it . Okay . Well no , not not you , you can finish your slides before <disfmarker> Okay . Okay , so . Anyway , users'll be <disfmarker> so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . Mm <vocalsound> okay . So that was very <disfmarker> I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . Okay . That's it . That's all ? Yep . Okay , so mm <vocalsound> so well done for the presentations . So we need to take some de decisions about um <vocalsound> about what we're going to do . <vocalsound> So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard Yeah . and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product Okay . and uh where Superman go banana and uh <gap> <vocalsound> uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order <disfmarker> not to lost the um the device , Mm-hmm . I do I don't remember you call it ? That's right . The basis station . That's right . Basis station , yeah . Uh so um <vocalsound> so we're going for a stylish banana shape . Yeah , so , I guess you wanna hold <disfmarker> like the way <disfmarker> the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than <disfmarker> 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor . Yeah , right . So you know , so if you have like <disfmarker> What about what about this shape ? More or less . We There's less space on this to put with the buttons . I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could <disfmarker> Yeah , but how many buttons do we need ? the the starting is good but it could <disfmarker> it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult <disfmarker> if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . Uh what about a <disfmarker> So ti time is running , we have to we have to we have to to move forward . So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . Yeah . Okay , so <disfmarker> So we have this . So <disfmarker> We have a a basis um , how do you call it <gap> ? The base station . A base station . Right . <vocalsound> We'll have a base station extra uh on the side . <gap> okay , so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping . That's right , yeah , we need that , yeah . We need b R_F_ to beep . Okay , so it's uh <disfmarker> So we <disfmarker> that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . Yeah . Basis station . Basis station , Yeah , yeah . thank you . <vocalsound> Alright , so we need uh <disfmarker> okay . <vocalsound> Can you go quickly please ? Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> So we are going to add uh also um you <disfmarker> as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels Yeah . and your tur turbo turbo uh button . Yeah , which <disfmarker> I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , Turbo button . Yeah , on the th yeah , maybe here . so you have <disfmarker> And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance . Yes . Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . And and you have two wheels . So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . Okay right . Good . And , uh <disfmarker> So no L_C_D_ . No L_C_D_ . Okay great . <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> Very good . Okay . Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . Yeah . Uh for the remote ? Yeah . Oh , just the switch , Remotes don't have power on off switch . no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . Yeah . Uh so you <disfmarker> Okay . S no , that'll be controlled by the <disfmarker> What a those buttons'll be there already , yeah . Where ? Means on the remote . On the side . Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . Okay . They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote Oh , yeah . in the first place , you know . That's that's another issue which I didn't think of . Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um <disfmarker> But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . What about <disfmarker> Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? I can't remember , Twenty five . <vocalsound> Twelve point five is the profit on one . Twenty five . Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell <gap> ? Uh forty th four . Four millions ? Point point four million ? Four point four million . Point four million . <vocalsound> That's a lot of fruit . <vocalsound> In the market . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> What about a <disfmarker> Yeah . So . Well . No . Time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . Okay . So , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat . Okay . The next step is to go for <vocalsound> <disfmarker> to f is to go to uh to building a prototype , based on this , okay ? Okay . So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation . Okay ? I wo what about adding the <disfmarker> this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying <gap> volume up volume down ? It's too difficult . It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few <disfmarker> five words . It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it's <disfmarker> in the next prototype so let's skip it . Uh . <vocalsound> Okay . For the future prototypes . <vocalsound> Yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one . That can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah , honour the fruit . Plus plus , okay . Maybe objective banana ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thanks very much . We'll see n next meeting . Bye . So meeting's over ? Okay . Yep . Okay . Okay . We have to go design the prototype . Okay . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . The problem is after all this meeting there is <gap> <vocalsound> <gap>
Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . Okay , well <vocalsound> I'd say let's start with the first presentation . 'Kay . Um in the same order as last time ? W sure . Mm . Alright . Okay . Well , take it away . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Okay uh welcome you all . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Components design , um <vocalsound> uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh <disfmarker> elaborate some of the things I did . I I elaborated on the concept . What should be um uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um <vocalsound> you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . <vocalsound> I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about . Don't destroy my giraffe . <vocalsound> Giraffe's gone now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . There's one of the <disfmarker> because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control Drop it . and they break uh Hmm . becau the uh titanium was also an option . But uh it's a very expensive material . Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh for our remote control . Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to <disfmarker> it lets lets itself colour . Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . But it's a very strong material . Um <vocalsound> I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . <vocalsound> Uh so it's t two dimensional . I think it's uh it's best to draw oh green . <vocalsound> It's a colour . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bright colour . Fancy colour . Forward . Uh <disfmarker> New . Blank . Okay . You have to go t Let's make it uh black . Okay . I thought of an idea like this . Oh <gap> that . <vocalsound> Um delete . Blank . Okay . So it also looks nice when it's on your table . So you get <gap> uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands . Oh it's a side view . Side view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , <vocalsound> but . <vocalsound> Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too . One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some <gap> or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . <vocalsound> And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . True . So uh uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh <vocalsound> the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . Questions , <gap> ? No no no no no . No . <vocalsound> Just looking . And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it <vocalsound> with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side . Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . That was correct , wasn't it ? Mm-hmm . Okay . I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . <vocalsound> Well , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour , Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ? but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . <vocalsound> Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ? It must be recognisable . Okay okay . Well that's possible of course . We could make a little R_ and R_ <gap> on the top of the machine . You can put the R_ and R_ . <vocalsound> Uh so they are <vocalsound> pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people in which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh <vocalsound> them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Well that's all about my uh my findings . Alright . Okay , thank you . Mm mm mm . Next . I will go next . <gap> <gap> Alright so <vocalsound> I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . And uh <vocalsound> uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . Mm . This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . Mm . Um perhaps it's useful , Mm . perhaps for because people um lose the remote , Mm . they can yell uh remote where are you and <gap> calls or something . <vocalsound> It's true . And perhaps we could uh implement that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like Oh my God . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> but I can't draw , so uh don't <vocalsound> make too much of it <vocalsound> . I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw <gap> . I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . I don't know if there is an icon for the program , but Not just a P_ . yeah . P_ yeah , just a P_ . So uh .. . <gap> and then the buttons above and uh below <vocalsound> the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . Um . Where's where's the button for two <gap> ? I forgot that one . <gap> Okay . <vocalsound> I thought I forgot something , <vocalsound> but uh <vocalsound> . And uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . Ah . Doesn't matter . Um an options button . And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . Mm-hmm . It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . No . Yep . So could call it settings or something . But this is a bit uh how I thought it . And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand or something uh . Oh okay , yeah . But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . Oh yeah , <gap> . And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh <disfmarker> And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , Mm-hmm . so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . Mm . Okay . That's an option . And that was my uh finding dinge . Thanks . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Now our third Go Danny , go Danny . <vocalsound> team member with his presentation . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . 'Kay . The method I used was <disfmarker> Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's <vocalsound> quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . And the third thing is it should be easy to use . I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . Fruity ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Grass green . Fruity . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like that . The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . Mm . Okay . It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . <vocalsound> Let's build it into a sponge . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Th Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . They liked square shapes with round edges . And hard materials like wood , um titanium . They those kind of materials they liked . This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like Oh y <vocalsound> this or something . It's it's a bit like a banana . And the colour should be yellow , or something . <gap> And for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? It was one remote , I think , Different colours , yeah . different colours . We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but <gap> easy to use . Mm . <vocalsound> So that's it . Okay . So for the older people , a more traditional uh form . That is my <disfmarker> Yeah , like the older o older colours I can maybe <disfmarker> You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . I don't know which shape you should should take , Yeah . <vocalsound> Colours th the elderly people <disfmarker> but . Yeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh Yeah . Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? the shape of it . Perhaps you could find something in the middle . Yeah , Round but square . <vocalsound> s round corners , but s but square , yeah . <gap> Yeah . But maybe then both groups won't buy it . Yeah . Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh <vocalsound> i Do you know what I mean ? Yeah I know what you mean , kind of like a <gap> . <vocalsound> <gap> wait , like <vocalsound> like this <vocalsound> uh a bit . Yeah . So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . Kinda like a beer glass . <vocalsound> Yeah . So but then <disfmarker> I know what you mean . Same sides . <vocalsound> It's also easy to to have <vocalsound> to to put in your hand . But that's uh <disfmarker> Yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's uh <disfmarker> Yeah . But perhaps that's a good thing , so that's easy to use . People know the <disfmarker> Will recognise that's as a remote control . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Look something like that <gap> . Autumn colours like red , brown . Uh when I saw your d Oh . They liked the wood a lot . Huh . Mm-hmm . So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , kinda like old cars , uh <disfmarker> And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Let's put it all together . <vocalsound> Swords . <vocalsound> Those kind of <disfmarker> Yeah , those kind of things . So you see the big difference between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . Yeah . And the old people , old and boring . <gap> But that's easily to do with the colour , I think . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Sorry ? That's easy to do with the colours , I think . Yeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . Yeah . Uh . Because otherwise we have to <gap> get different shapes , Yeah we think so too . and colour <gap> way easier than yeah the shapes . In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones <vocalsound> and the old people like <vocalsound> plain wood . Yeah . Yeah . So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that . Yeah think uh <disfmarker> Soft rubber . Also in between . <vocalsound> Yeah <gap> soft rubber <gap> which you can you can feel in it . Yeah I know what you <disfmarker> Um . I don't think you should be able to mould it , Or <disfmarker> but <vocalsound> <disfmarker> No . Or or wh It should shouldn't be <gap> . what's something harder . No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , Yeah . or something harder . Uh . Bit like this kind of rubber . This uh <disfmarker> Yeah , something like this , yeah . But it's quite hard , this . Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . Yeah . It's feels kind s spongy . <vocalsound> Spongy . Hmm . Something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't think it's rubber . No . N n n So we need a spongy feeling . <vocalsound> Uh did you have something about uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> So we should first decide about shape , I think . Ding ding . <vocalsound> Yeah I think that's the better thing to do . <vocalsound> Which uh <disfmarker> Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , <gap> and can decide uh . Um I also s uh can't help but notice <vocalsound> that you uh used an <disfmarker> you had a remote control <gap> <vocalsound> and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um . Yeah w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like <disfmarker> Yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit .. . This was your size , Yeah . but I think it should be larger . Yeah three quarter of the of the <disfmarker> Yeah , three quarters . So uh so you don't have to put your <disfmarker> <vocalsound> oh . Yeah the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is <disfmarker> Uh new , blank . So uh when you get <vocalsound> this uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <gap> Ooh <vocalsound> Uh kinda like this . Mm-hmm . Or should it be larger ? Yeah . Larger I think . Larger ? Because you want to put your hands <disfmarker> But if you pu Yeah becau because you have <disfmarker> Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . You want Yeah . Perhaps that's best . Yeah okay , true , true , true true . Your thumb here . <vocalsound> But not on the screen because <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah that's uh that's an idea . Yeah . Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . <vocalsound> Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll <vocalsound> you'll always get some <disfmarker> You <disfmarker> You always touch it , Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . yeah . Going to be very greasy and stuff . But it won't get that small because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . Yeah . One to zero , the two digit , <disfmarker> Yeah you don't want it too small . How yeah how large <disfmarker> You have to you have to <disfmarker> Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . <vocalsound> Yeah they have thick fingers <gap> . But if you wanna make it in international , Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands Yeah true , but <disfmarker> and we got these large <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ? Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , No . hey , we we want to do it with our fingers , Yeah . right ? Your fingers , yeah . Yeah . You don't want uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Y you could include a pen Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use <disfmarker> Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen . Yeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers Yeah <gap> the fingers , yeah . because th they're used to that Yeah o yeah <gap> , if they think it's handy to use a pen . and <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something . And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah <gap> Yeah but that that can be <gap> with plain soft tissue . You can do <gap> whatever uh any uh cloth . Yeah , you can buy those at <disfmarker> Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . Sure . So we can discuss these points . <gap> those points um energy question mark . How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how <disfmarker> are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put <gap> in it . Uh chip on print and case . Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them . <vocalsound> I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh <disfmarker> The docking station . Yeah . Yeah . So that's the the the first point . Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries We already decided that on the previous meeting . W <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . which you can recharge through the docking station . Yeah . So Mm-hmm . Yeah . if the badg the batteries are dead Just like with the telephone . I kinda like your <disfmarker> then you can re you can uh change them . Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse . Yeah yeah yeah like those . Kinda like those kind of batteries . Yep . <vocalsound> but it should be th I think normal batteries , <vocalsound> not not like two or two uh <disfmarker> Yeah , normal plain you <disfmarker> No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Simple rechargeable uh batteries . Yeah . Um what was with the chip on print ? The chip on print ? Um <disfmarker> Uh you gotta f Yeah . I think so . Chip on print with a with a <vocalsound> simple uh a sim not a simple but a <disfmarker> Print plate . We also discussed that . Didn't we ? <vocalsound> Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? You still have a print plate . Uh <gap> Yeah yeah yeah . You always have a print plate . Beg your pardon ? You always have a print plate , right ? Yeah sure , of course , yeah . Mm-hmm . Always , so <disfmarker> I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . Yeah well it's a good question . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It just was in there <gap> Well uh and I didn't have any information about it , chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . but <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not <vocalsound> <disfmarker> the buttons are not always on the same place , Yeah , okay . But <disfmarker> for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . Yeah . When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place Yeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , and you got on the and on the <disfmarker> Yeah . so that that's not of any discussion , I think . Well <gap> I suppose so . you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's <disfmarker> It is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't <disfmarker> Yeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . Yeah because it has to uh b Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . Yeah , okay , true true . True . So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ to know uh in which state you are <vocalsound> and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . <gap> And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . Yeah . And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , It's rubber . we wanted to make it from rubber Yeah and uh <disfmarker> but but a hard rubber like this ? Or softer rubber or <disfmarker> Uh hard rubber I think . Yeah . That's the easy to ha uh to to uh <disfmarker> Yeah . It bounces back from the floor where you <vocalsound> throw it . Yeah . Yeah sure , We have different colours . look <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah this in different colours ? So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? D No I don't think , I think it's more round than square . <vocalsound> Yeah it's a bit . But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people . Yeah . I think so too . Yeah . But that's what we want , <gap> . Yeah , that's our target . Yeah . It's our main target . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Lower than forty years , I think <gap> it was . Well and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? Oh yeah that that <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> So i I thought that was a quite good Yeah . Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course . Yeah . Yeah yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away . Yeah . Uh . You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , So <disfmarker> Because it Yeah . you don't have to put it <disfmarker> get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in Yeah . Yeah , that's a good idea . and <gap> . Yeah . It's a lot easier . Yeah , alright . So <disfmarker> So , so Okay so <disfmarker> you got uh <disfmarker> Did you write that down ? And then <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh got a single curved uh rubber f uh fancy coloured <vocalsound> remote control . <vocalsound> You can't you You can't <vocalsound> oh , you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the Yeah . Yeah , you can uh <disfmarker> Yeah It's pretty easy but I wrote it down . <vocalsound> but <disfmarker> And load it on the the user the server . And <disfmarker> What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that <gap> . Yeah , I had what I just uh You you showed your drawing . I should <gap> again . I miss a few buttons , but . Well . At least uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh <gap> if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . Mm-hmm . Yeah , you have to go back . Yeah uh uh . This <gap> <disfmarker> Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? I don't know . With the minus and the plus . I think it's <disfmarker> I think it's easier than <disfmarker> I don't know . I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way , Yeah . but I don't know what they think . Sorry ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? Mm . For sound and channel . Depends on the screen . Th If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . If you make it uh in a rectangle <disfmarker> Right well Yeah . if we make it like this , I think if you I so it's it's it's it's <disfmarker> put it like this <disfmarker> Square . <gap> I think it's it's easier to have it something like <disfmarker> Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here . <gap> Oh , okay . And on here . Yeah . The other buttons and on here <vocalsound> the top . The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here , Yeah . <gap> But I think I wou and the sound . I think that's a matter of what you're used to . Something uh <disfmarker> I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle . Uh . <gap> Something like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Sh <vocalsound> Take your time . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Plus minus plus uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Almost . <vocalsound> <gap> minus . Yeah but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . Yeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb . Yeah but I think <disfmarker> Yeah I don't know . <vocalsound> Perhaps I have some examples . W We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . <vocalsound> I don't know <disfmarker> Who's the usability engineering ? That's me . She is . <gap> <gap> <vocalsound> But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . <vocalsound> Oh . The <disfmarker> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> 'Cause they can use that better . Consistency . Yeah . Oh <gap> <disfmarker> I have that those s numbers . I <disfmarker> Here is our <disfmarker> here are uh Or a good watch . I don't really know . B Everybody's searching in his data . <vocalsound> Yeah . Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . Volume selection four times an hour Yeah but <gap> <disfmarker> But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> So not how much <disfmarker> n not how often it's used , but <disfmarker> W what's what's usual or normal . Yeah , that depends on on on the remote . Yes I'm looking here . But here's it's below , Uh . here also , and now here's here's next to each other . <gap> I think it's <gap> it's a <disfmarker> I think <gap> because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends . Yeah it does it doesn't really matter , Yeah . but <disfmarker> Yeah . Depends . Uh . I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down . Yeah , lower . And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back . <gap> True . That's how it's is usually <gap> when I look here Okay , um . that's what I see . Let's cut to the chase . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's got to change . <vocalsound> Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons I don't know . Yeah is it is user interface . just the Yeah . concepts . Component . This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a <disfmarker> Okay , well le Yeah . Interface , yeah . And the speech uh shall we implement that ? Or uh <disfmarker> Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ? Yeah I think it's it's easy for that , Technologies , uh . where are you , but then it says I'm here . Yeah . Yeah . Makes it possible to <disfmarker> But then you should also find a place <disfmarker> Yeah . You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . Mm . You can talk into the corner . Yeah , a microphone , yeah . <gap> Not even necessary , Mm-hmm . because a lotta <disfmarker> you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh <vocalsound> just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote . Yeah . Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh But <disfmarker> <gap> Yeah , that's also <gap> . Yeah . Right . over there . So , But that's not import I think that's not im very important in the middle or something . Yeah , yeah . because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is . <gap> but you should uh decide where you want to put it . Ah okay , sure , okay , Right ? <vocalsound> well tha Um I think where it isn't seen Underneath ? the most . <gap> Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible . Inside . You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah sure , why no Well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out I i between the round of the R_ . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control . Yeah . Yeah , okay . So where do you want to put it ? Well maybe where the one hand <disfmarker> Yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh <disfmarker> Yeah actually it does <vocalsound> Yeah . because it you can you can find it better if you use it . Yeah bu but <disfmarker> It's a way for you to uh <disfmarker> Uh . So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that . Yeah , okay . But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? About a microphone , Yeah there is no button . because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big Yeah . so as its its really an important function of the remote . I think the left s under corner should be the best . <gap> Where isn't <disfmarker> i it isn't most in sight . Yeah . Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . <vocalsound> I think . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That doesn't doesn't really matter . No . Actually doesn't . Okay . So ? Alright . Any more uh <disfmarker> So well uh <vocalsound> Interface type . type , supplements , anything . Yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ The L_C_D_ yeah , uh supplements well the supplement is to <disfmarker> and <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> I think <disfmarker> I thought the , like you said , like scroll <vocalsound> next to the remote isn't that handy . yeah . Yeah . I think it's better to just <gap> up what you'd like to do on the screen . <gap> If you want to go back you have to back button go back , <gap> Yeah . if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . Hey , <vocalsound> Um yeah . Yeah <gap> . <vocalsound> the the young people do like uh scroll uh Use the scroll . Yeah ? You do like it ? Yeah I think so too . So why not , on on side . Or at least <disfmarker> Yeah I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu <gap> they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh <disfmarker> Fast , yeah . Yeah I think it is is faster . So if you've got a settings , if you <disfmarker> Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , Yes . <vocalsound> but if you don't have a lot of option then <disfmarker> But you have <disfmarker> it's f uh You have a lot of options , we have five or four or something . because when you use <disfmarker> Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . Y Mm-hmm . Uh-huh . Yeah , okay , true . Yeah . So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , Okay . you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . <gap> Okay , no problem . And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side Yeah , yeah . which you can touch Yeah . <vocalsound> and <disfmarker> It's also different . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okay . Well there's our five minutes uh warning . Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ? Um . No , colours are clear , shape is clear , Everybody think they can can material is clear . Okay , what's the standard colour ? work for that ? And a standard , yeah Is there a standard colour ? we don't <disfmarker> no we have different colour . I I How many colours are we going to <disfmarker> You got you got different colours , You should you should have a black one but you should have a standard colour . because uh I think black is standard . Black . Yeah , black I think is is the standard . Black ? With the with the yellow uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But if you want to be different , then uh <disfmarker> Dark grey , something like this this colour or something . Just a regular uh remote colour . Yeah like like yeah . And then have uh different covers uh to use . Or or silver . I think it's better to have silver nowadays . Silver , yeah . Silver . I think you see more silver than black . Yeah . You see a lot of t uh silver televisions . But still silver and black are <disfmarker> Silver rubber . <vocalsound> Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . well silver is new but also traditional , so uh <disfmarker> I think we have silver , black and between those <vocalsound> is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . Yeah w what about a yellow thing , I mean it Yeah y I think it's better to <disfmarker> Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow , we have . could be ugly , but it's definitely fancy . R red . <vocalsound> But Yeah th yeah . That's right . yeah . Green , wood , brown . But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . Yeah . True . When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . Yeah . Silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine . Mm-hmm . Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this . Yeah . You understand ? <vocalsound> Yeah , I understand . Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , Yeah o of course . Yeah . just <disfmarker> The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , <gap> dark red and brown . Fruity . Yeah . Just all kind of colour . Fruity loops . Mm-hmm . Maroon . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Okay , so <disfmarker> And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh <disfmarker> Who's pinging ? Is it <disfmarker> No <gap> . You are pingin Okay . <vocalsound> You ping . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I thought we Okay , so uh that wraps it up ? Everybody knows uh what to do ? Yeah . Well Well I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um . not what to do . Not what to do . Well I don't know what to do , but . <vocalsound> The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . Okay . Um here are the individual actions , and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , Ooh . <vocalsound> Right . S Yeah . and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach . tough . We'll be available . But do we have to <disfmarker> We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we <disfmarker> Well I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out . Right . Yes . Okay . <vocalsound> I don't know . <vocalsound> Thin I think we should work <vocalsound> . Okay well that was what I had to say , uh , Yeah I think <gap> . final thoughts from anyone , or ? No . No . We're finished . Okay , well thank you very much . Yeah . Finished . Thank you very much . So we have to keep talking English now ? <vocalsound>
<vocalsound> <gap> <gap> Mm-hmm So , ready ? No not really 'Kay <gap> Just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Crap . <vocalsound> Sorry , <vocalsound> I I um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . It's perfect . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Your judgement it's <disfmarker> is biased . <vocalsound> I'm afraid <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ? <vocalsound> So , Where ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we are <vocalsound> It's here . <vocalsound> So <vocalsound> Okay . let's go for our detailed design meeting . Yep . So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , Okay . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and our Industrial Designer , Baba . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we'll have to evaluate the uh <disfmarker> your proposed remote control , 'Kay . and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And in case if we're <disfmarker> we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So maybe I will let the <disfmarker> our two designers talk about so their <disfmarker> I have slides . Okay . You have s oh , sorry . Oops . Ah , Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything . Product prod What slides ? Yep . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> So , this is our product or prototype . This is made by clay . Looks strange . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , Okay . uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . It's <disfmarker> Okay . we call it a mushroom design . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> So this is a introduction of our product . <vocalsound> Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but Next a mo <vocalsound> Okay , Yeah . <vocalsound> <disfmarker> keep on speaking . yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah I'm sure <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Maybe , I hope so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . Yeah , that's true . Um , and uh the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . So it's quite convenient for user to use it . Chan Yeah , okay , but don't touch <disfmarker> don't destroy your prototype . <vocalsound> Yeah , s <vocalsound> <vocalsound> okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Everything's mushroom . Yeah <gap> . Yeah , everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom . Mush Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh <vocalsound> like lemon shape , you know , Mushroom design , yeah . centre <vocalsound> is yellow and t d Yeah Okay . Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . <vocalsound> To integrate , you know <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> I don't think <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I hope nobody will eat it <gap> You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the <vocalsound> the <vocalsound> in Yeah Oh . Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Really ? Fruits and vegetables . But <disfmarker> Fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was a kind of you know <gap> uh <disfmarker> Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . <vocalsound> Yeah . I don't think it is . It's vegetable . Mushroom ? Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh , uh I'm not sure . <vocalsound> So th it's something eatable . We can <disfmarker> Yeah . it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we we integrated them with different colour . Yeah . But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . Yeah . <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable <gap> you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . No , I mean , yeah <vocalsound> yeah . Inspira inspiration is <disfmarker> And inspired colour <vocalsound> and <vocalsound> and very sophisticated material , so . True . Yeah . And so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Next slide . Uh , no this our only two slides . <vocalsound> <gap> So what we w what I can add is that , you know <vocalsound> he talk about what is outside , Yeah . so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and <disfmarker> So we cut it to see . <vocalsound> You know , we don't need to k <vocalsound> . Mm-hmm . You know wi <vocalsound> the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i Okay . So where's the battery battery ? The battery it is under <gap> . It is in th in <disfmarker> in the base , yeah . <vocalsound> In the base . Base . In the basement . In the basement . Here ? And where is the solar solar cell ? But we say uh we sa we said solar . <vocalsound> Where is the solar cell ? In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and <disfmarker> Oh . Do you think it won't be <disfmarker> It won't cris increase the price ? Okay <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> I don't think so , Okay , we'll see after . <vocalsound> but it it's might be okay , so . We will have first to <disfmarker> I it might be okay . So <disfmarker> so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about <disfmarker> uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> we had three keys <disfmarker> <vocalsound> key points to uh for this remote control design , <vocalsound> and first one was uh Mm-hmm . fancy look and feel . Yeah . Yeah . So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . <vocalsound> Uh just let me check . So , four point <disfmarker> three point five , it means it's acceptable . One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . Oops . Ouch . So Okay . Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? Yeah , I think so . I think you have nice colours . <vocalsound> I don't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But is it <disfmarker> The sha the bowl shape people like . Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour <disfmarker> Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Is it really fancy ? <vocalsound> So it depend on how d do you define fancy . Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . <vocalsound> But it's <disfmarker> you have the lemon aspect of this th this <vocalsound> this thing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Maybe if you change <disfmarker> if you take the buttons out , <vocalsound> Do Don't do that , please . and maybe do things like that <disfmarker> I dunno where the lemon is , but <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so <disfmarker> I mean it's not obvious . It would be bet more like a lemon ? Yeah . If <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Because i I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or <disfmarker> Yeah . Less button . Uh so , my mush <disfmarker> . <gap> Looks like more fruit . Yeah , but you don't have any button now . Mm . Maybe a pineapple ? Yeah . I dunno . And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? Yeah . Hmm . That's uh yeah , is that <disfmarker> Yeah , it's getting <disfmarker> that's a good idea . So that's great . <vocalsound> It looks <vocalsound> more like a pineapple . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's great . <vocalsound> Sorry . What's the use for that ? Uh , for turn turn the ball . I have no idea , so . <vocalsound> If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . <vocalsound> I have no idea <vocalsound> what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And where is the voice recognition ? Okay . Uh . Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's <disfmarker> Okay . Th this th th there's two two functions . Wait th that's the second point . This is microphone array <disfmarker> First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . If it is fancy or not . Okay . Is it better like that ? I mean <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So we can we can say t Looks <disfmarker> okay , <vocalsound> let's say it's a pineapple now . <vocalsound> The colour , is the colour acceptable ? <vocalsound> No , the colour is okay , that's fine . So the shape now . I mean it's <disfmarker> It looks like a <vocalsound> <disfmarker> but I would say there is more <disfmarker> too much red . now you took it . It's too much red ? Um if In the basement ? It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Right . So , from one to seven ? <vocalsound> I will give <disfmarker> I will <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm uh <disfmarker> Seven is the ma the maximum ? No , seven is false and one is true . I'll gi I'll give two or three . Three , it's okay . Three , I will say three . Three , three . Three ? Three is fine for me . Okay . 'Kay Three . Isn't it bitter like that <gap> ? Yeah yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Then <vocalsound> uh let me <disfmarker> What other <disfmarker> The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . Is it easy to use ? <vocalsound> Feasible ? Ye uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You said previously that you <disfmarker> there's um microphone inside an Embedded . Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . It's a micro array , okay . There four microphone . Oh . Okay , So they they they they <disfmarker> there's a microphone array . and you have the <disfmarker> there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice <disfmarker> yeah , you c And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? Oh yeah , yeah . Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah . And I think you <disfmarker> you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is <disfmarker> Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single . I <vocalsound> W Yeah , but <disfmarker> We have tactile buttons . Mm-hmm . I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have <disfmarker> No , that's good . Yeah . That's good . Oh , yeah . Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe <disfmarker> okay . I think technically it's acceptable , so <disfmarker> Maybe two ? Yeah . So using the same scale , two ? Two ? Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so . I would say two . You agree ? Okay . Yeah , I agree . It's better like that , Now maybe the most critical one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> isn't it ? <vocalsound> Most <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> L last one w I would like to judge is is it easy to use ? Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . Yeah , it's very easy . You just need the command . Yeah but this this turning <disfmarker> You can use this in this way . can you can you just re explain me the <disfmarker> As a principle . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Please . Yeah . Th this is the base . <vocalsound> Yeah . So you can turn to change the channel . Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? You just tu turn d d I think maybe if you he Like if you want to go from <disfmarker> Oh , ok I understand . <vocalsound> If you hear some click <disfmarker> You take take <vocalsound> the remote , so <disfmarker> and you can turn like that to change the channel ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but imagine you y I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to <disfmarker> if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . Yeah . How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? <vocalsound> No , no , no . I <disfmarker> if y uh if <disfmarker> Yeah . it depend on the the angle you turn the <disfmarker> Yeah . I agree . I agree . Yeah but y how <disfmarker> But I mean if you're fro from two ? you need to know <disfmarker> I <disfmarker> I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . I think something that <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , you have a <vocalsound> , like that , and so on . So change . Yeah . And you you can <disfmarker> Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh <disfmarker> Oh yeah . Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the <disfmarker> by three hundred thirteen degree . We're not talking <disfmarker> Yeah . So you got how many degree you you <disfmarker> it <disfmarker> Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go <disfmarker> I think you can if you have a scale , so <disfmarker> No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the the turn , Mm-hmm . then the angle you stop is the angle you <disfmarker> is the channel you <disfmarker> Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the <disfmarker> So you you count <gap> one degree , two degrees , no . Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it . I don't think so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's a bit difficult . I think so <vocalsound> I think so you can do it . <vocalsound> I think so , you can just change . I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so <disfmarker> Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main <disfmarker> There's uh also a number , you know . Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's <disfmarker> you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . Uh , yeah , and y that's <disfmarker> yeah . But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . And this would be more for browsing , ah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? To see uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . yeah <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Seems to be good . Yeah . <vocalsound> Good choice , mister David Jordan . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , I mean you're famous . You <gap> . And but I'd <disfmarker> And also you can , if you i <gap> yeah , what's what's this cherry ? You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Mm . It's like fine , from coarse to fine . This is coarse , this is fine . Yeah , yeah yeah . That's Okay . So it's coarse to fine design . that's very technologic , so . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah . Yeah is is <disfmarker> this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates This is from one channel to <disfmarker> maybe one of the <disfmarker> Yeah , th you have the vocal commands . Yeah . Yeah . Uh it's k <gap> Yeah . On off . on off , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas <vocalsound> Most of the time you have the <disfmarker> yeah it's a sleeping remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah , sleeping . Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . Solar . <vocalsound> To compensate <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . So So , which number ? <disfmarker> three . <vocalsound> Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . Do you agree ? Yeah , agree , agree . Three ? So reasonably , is four , is one ? Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . So , three . <gap> <vocalsound> Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and <disfmarker> no and just take the mean . <vocalsound> And what's your opinion ? Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , Will you give four ? those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . Five ? Yeah , so maybe if <disfmarker> Uh w w what do y what uh <disfmarker> you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? Yeah . I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have <disfmarker> you just turn the turn the ball . Yeah but y you know <gap> <disfmarker> There's two kind of balls , So you have <disfmarker> the smaller the the the <disfmarker> so you can c you can c you can control the scale . <vocalsound> yeah . But in the traditional controller , how do <disfmarker> how can you control the scale ? Uh by pushing zero after after the first one . You just push two button , zero and and one . Yeah , And that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , Yeah . but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . Are there some buttons ? Okay . Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . Mm-hmm . It's not what you said previously . Previously you said that turning this was the fine <disfmarker> Yeah , if you're changing your mind . <gap> Fine to coarse . Fine to coarse . Yeah , yeah . And from ten to ten channels here . Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . Okay . Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? Mm-hmm . This has to stay on the table . <vocalsound> In fact on a flat place <disfmarker> I i this is just a base . You can just <disfmarker> You can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh ye yes , that's right . <vocalsound> Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . Just <disfmarker> It's <disfmarker> It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh It's impossible . <vocalsound> Yeah . You need to put it on and turn . <vocalsound> You know tha that's the weak point , <vocalsound> You use your y because with a traditional one you just have one hand . Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . <vocalsound> my God . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So th this is a d next generation controller . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Nobody would take it . <vocalsound> Sure . <vocalsound> Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . So nobody w will lost <disfmarker> lose it . <vocalsound> yeah maybe , maybe may Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay okay , okay . it's the next prototype , maybe we cou S maybe we can change from th Four . Maybe four , it's okay . Four . Okay . Four ? I'll put four . Easy to use , four . Gonna say four . Four . Yeah , four it's more reasonable . Uh it's even easier to <disfmarker> maybe . You can you can erase with this er yeah . Ok Okay . Mm . Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . So it's nine , So , average ? nine over three . Three ? Three ? Trois . Three . <vocalsound> Oh yeah , it's <gap> . Trois . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , so <disfmarker> It need maybe some wo further work , but it's <disfmarker> Yeah , especially on the easy to use Yeah , uh s yeah . Yeah . target . Might <disfmarker> it might be fine . So , th the project is accepted ? Okay . Yeah . Yeah , b I think <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> So uh mm mm . Mm . That's the finance . <vocalsound> Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . Yeah . Mm . Okay . <vocalsound> So we need to calculate the production cost . Mm-hmm . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . And if not <disfmarker> if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . Oh yeah . Yeah . So , just have a look at the <disfmarker> okay here is the <vocalsound> Excel sheet , so so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . No . We have battery , right ? Yeah , we have battery . Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , No , um solar cells , yeah . but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or <disfmarker> such as Uh I think in each ball you have three <disfmarker> <vocalsound> as number of branches ? Three ? three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three <gap> three solar cells . So , electronic . Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? S s simple , simple , yeah . One ? Yeah . Zero for the others . And sample sensor , sample speaker . One ? Mm . One maybe , yeah . As we have voice recognition , I think . Yeah yeah yeah . So the case . Is it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Is sh it <gap> So we are all already nineteen . Wooden . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea . The solar cell is too expensive . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Is <disfmarker> Yes a wooden pl I and that's <disfmarker> There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . Well uh <disfmarker> yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved . That's gonna be double curved , yeah . Double curve , yeah , double curve . One ? One , you have . <vocalsound> Uh wood ? <vocalsound> But it's <disfmarker> yeah , Rather four buttons . a a rubber uh <disfmarker> Oh no , interface . Uh do we need special colour ? Y maybe , two ? Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . We have two special colours . Push button . Mm . Yeah , we have four . <vocalsound> Five . <vocalsound> Five ? Okay . <vocalsound> Scroll wheel . No . We don no . It it's more like integrated scor . I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . No no . Yeah tha that's wheel . Y you tu you turn you turn it , so <disfmarker> No no no , it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . Yeah . Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr So , no button supplements ? I think the price is okay . No . Okay . Um , no . Okay we <disfmarker> I think we have problem . <vocalsound> L_C_ display , maybe . Interface . I think we s if we keep on adding things <disfmarker> It's okay . <vocalsound> <gap> fine <gap> . so we have to <disfmarker> Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? Yeah . Has it changed . <vocalsound> Yeah , it was stage one , so . No y i it did change , but Okay . We have change the electronics to <disfmarker> from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . just imagine we have <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think . Yeah . Yeah , but we have <disfmarker> you <disfmarker> the the voice recognition , no ? Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really <disfmarker> Yeah it's the one it's <disfmarker> m maybe we ha we have two versions , Okay . the first version , the basic version . I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Advanced version we have speak . Yeah . Because uh it seems that this can be <disfmarker> Yeah , if <disfmarker> Or it would be better . yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . Plastic is free . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So , do we need special colour ? Yeah , that's one of the requirement . Because we have red . Yeah , red and yellow . Wait . Red and yellow . We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . Fancy . We we can we can we c <vocalsound> yellow . Black then is a regular colour , so . <gap> I think so we need <disfmarker> if we try to have a kind of Yeah , one . pineapple bee . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So push button then it's it's the next expensive one . Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Yeah , thi this might be . Integrated scroll wheel push button . So we'll <disfmarker> we have only one ? And push button . Close to . So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh <disfmarker> One . I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have <disfmarker> yeah . Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? How about we change the sale ? Double curved . Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . Something flat . F some <disfmarker> Yeah , but flat <disfmarker> S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not . <vocalsound> Single curve <gap> . Case , what's the ca Yeah . Single curve should be fine , so . Oh , what <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Nearly . Ah we have one <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And then one Euro left . <vocalsound> Um . <vocalsound> Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . <vocalsound> It's it's a bad idea , so . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . <vocalsound> Two ? One . <vocalsound> Just one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . That's fine . That's fine . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Agree . So we have one button , So <vocalsound> yeah , you will have <disfmarker> <gap> One s one scroll wheel , so one wheel . So one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it . <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And the vocal chord , it's fine . <gap> It I th it's fine . So <disfmarker> It's good they're not charging anything for that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is Cou could we have look <disfmarker> twelve fifty e Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ? Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . <vocalsound> Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . It's fine . Sometimes it's under or equal . It's under or equal . It's fine , so <disfmarker> Okay . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> So let's say <disfmarker> Twelve fifty . Wha what <disfmarker> yeah . It's fine , twelve fifty uh <disfmarker> Which part is the most expensive part ? <vocalsound> Solar cells . The solar cells , r is i is it ? Yeah , I think . Yeah , I think it's not t t I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be <disfmarker> Yeah , to be able to si to sell it . Yeah . Cheaper . That's nice argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve . Yeah , with mi It's <disfmarker> it is really really uh really very very expensive , though . Yeah . Maybe if uh <disfmarker> okay . Okay . Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Yeah but we just have one button . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah . It's easy to use . It's very easy to use . <gap> <vocalsound> Easy , powerful . <vocalsound> Mm . So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . No . Uh that's what we've just done . We've done it with <disfmarker> it is under the <disfmarker> if it was low , high or so . Yeah . Yeah . Um So <disfmarker> okay . Now <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? So <disfmarker> Well I think we have just have to discuss if <disfmarker> Okay , okay , it's fine . I dunno . So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? Yes . Of course . This is my job . <vocalsound> Yeah ? <vocalsound> Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? <vocalsound> Yeah , it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to <disfmarker> from the beginning to the end . And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very <vocalsound> informative for <gap> . Yeah . And for the marketing guy ? Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . Yep <vocalsound> . 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it <disfmarker> um . Okay . Okay , okay . And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh and yellow . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yellow . <vocalsound> I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after <disfmarker> <vocalsound> a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It can be an interesting I don't know <disfmarker> Yes , just lemon . Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be <vocalsound> yellow lemon . Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um <disfmarker> It's flat , uh <disfmarker> Yeah yeah it's flat , Squared ? yeah the shape is very boring . Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah . Could we come up with new T_V_ with <disfmarker> such as this kind of T_V_ ? Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . <vocalsound> Yeah , that's <disfmarker> that would be really interesting , actually . Yeah . Yeah . Because the T_V_ you <vocalsound> also <disfmarker> Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . <vocalsound> <gap> Device devi <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . Yeah . The fruit ? <vocalsound> Yeah . 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . Maybe <disfmarker> Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . Yeah , it's <disfmarker> Maybe two years it's dead . <vocalsound> Yeah . But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . Yeah . Mm . Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . Yeah . T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . Yeah , yeah . That's a <disfmarker> yeah , yeah . If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . fifteen years <disfmarker> Customable T_V_ . Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , yeah . Ah such <disfmarker> yeah . You've already said mobile phones . Tha that would that would make it . Yeah . Okay . Yeah , you can keep the global appearan Yeah , and following <disfmarker> The mood of persons , the fashions uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . We int <vocalsound> It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , T_V_ , yeah . Yeah . A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So what i and do w is it <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Okay . So I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros . Yeah , the pr <gap> at <disfmarker> Yep . Yeah . So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> do you think you can celebrate your creation ? And you can celebrate your leadership . <vocalsound> Oh , thanks a lot . <vocalsound> Thank you , mister David Jordan . <vocalsound> Yeah but I think f <vocalsound> it's really a celebrating object . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So it's yellow and very <disfmarker> a very ha it's very happy , so . Hmm . Yeah . It's party party remote control . Uh it's it's a pr it's like <disfmarker> yeah . The thing now is to to sell it . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's your job . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , <vocalsound> Sell it . <vocalsound> right , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay and the twelve fifty <disfmarker> twelve uh twelve <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh-huh . Twenty five Euros . Twenty five Euros , yeah . Yeah , I think it's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It should be fine . Twenty five Euros . It's maybe a little bit expensive . <vocalsound> It's cheap , yeah . <vocalsound> No , I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No , it's not so expensive . I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . <vocalsound> Wh really ? <vocalsound> It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . <vocalsound> S <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , <vocalsound> it's really fruit . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I think I like <vocalsound> the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . No , the colours are uh <disfmarker> it's perfect , yeah . It's perfect , and <disfmarker> True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . I p is th y <vocalsound> Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more <disfmarker> is most important , the the yellow ball thing that <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's <disfmarker> yeah but it <disfmarker> I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_ <disfmarker> Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . Yeah . So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . Mm . Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , So we have to give a <disfmarker> so we have the slogan too . So we have give him <disfmarker> give it a cute name . <gap> Cute na Yeah Mush mushroom controller . th no , it's the it's the pineapple control <disfmarker> remote control . You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . It's not a mushroom . It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . It's not the trend . <vocalsound> It's a pineapple remote controls . Pa Pineapple . Pine apple . Yeah , pineapple remote remote control . Yeah , but just flying saucer , or <disfmarker> With cherry on top . <vocalsound> Oh , that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . I would say flying saucer . Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's more appropriate , somehow . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . <vocalsound> Mm . Okay . Will you buy one ? Yeah . Yeah I will try <vocalsound> I'll try <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Try to . Okay uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Twenty five <vocalsound> Euro . <gap> . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ <vocalsound> Yeah I always lose my <disfmarker> Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so you need to buy one . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . Mm . <gap> Traditional one ? Yeah . So this one and this one . What do you choose ? I prefer the laser remote control . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's <vocalsound> What do you choose ? Okay . it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . Okay . Yeah . Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd <disfmarker> can put light inside . Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . Yeah . We had some problems <vocalsound> going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno . <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> I think it it would be interesting to <disfmarker> just to see if we can <disfmarker> if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . Yeah , afterwards , if Yeah . Yeah . if it's a new trend . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah that's that fine . So <disfmarker> So we can celebrate now . That's our new product . Champagne <gap> , mister Baba . <vocalsound> We should celebrate . <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's it's fine . It's <disfmarker> I like it <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Next time . <vocalsound> So buy one . <vocalsound> Well , I'll buy one here . Yeah . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Mm . Okay , I will close this . Mm . Yeah . No ? <vocalsound> So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control Okay . Okay . Yeah . and we have a nearly final product . Our final prototype which <disfmarker> yeah . Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . Final prototype , right . Prototype , yeah . So , Okay . thank you very much . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Very productive . <vocalsound> Okay . Thanks . S so who is going to take the remote control ?
Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , <gap> . <vocalsound> because that's going to influence our design . Oh no . Oh , <gap> . <vocalsound> If you <disfmarker> Don't know if you al already had a look or not ? Did you do your questionnaire already ? No n I I already did it . No . It's not much . It's just one question . Because we have a problem . Uh <disfmarker> Oh . <vocalsound> If you look closely , you can see . Yeah . It wants <disfmarker> Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions . <gap> . <gap> . <vocalsound> At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy . And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour . Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ? No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah but everything is . Uh <disfmarker> Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? <vocalsound> Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . No . Yeah , b but <disfmarker> Yeah but young people like that . So just do normal battery . Batteries ? Batteries . I think the battery option . Just a normal battery then , yeah . Yeah . <gap> . It has to be twelve and a half . Yeah . Or not ? <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Oh my goodness . So <disfmarker> You're going to redesign something . <vocalsound> Oh no . Okay , so we're at twenty five . Uh , yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything . Mm-hmm . But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> and the screen screen is just <disfmarker> Yeah . Well you just have to hold it like this then . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . How about <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> Sorry . Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That's what I was thinking . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros . Yeah . Alright . Yeah ? Let's do it then . Yeah . A a Uh then we have left <disfmarker> <gap> we <disfmarker> But we don't have any basic options any more . <vocalsound> Uh yeah . We do . And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . F_ eight . They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You were saying something . That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one Yeah . <disfmarker> I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . Mm-hmm . Yeah . And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click <disfmarker> Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . But um <disfmarker> Now let's look . Yeah we c could <disfmarker> We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . <vocalsound> Everything you can do with with the menu . So <disfmarker> With the display . Mm-hmm . Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then . Yeah . The joystick . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Kind of . I was <disfmarker> Because <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh <disfmarker> Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah . If you if you go to <disfmarker> If you go to our uh view , like you <disfmarker> if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , Yeah . Yeah . this is just uh an example , Mm-hmm . y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . Yeah . Yeah . So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button . Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . Yeah . So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . But you still <disfmarker> Exactly . But you then still need to have <disfmarker> Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um <disfmarker> Yeah it's r Yeah . You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back . So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . Yeah . And then just drop all the other buttons . Uh yeah . Well not all . Not s not sound I guess . But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . <vocalsound> No . Yeah . It's uh <disfmarker> One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . So we have to to make it s uh more uh <disfmarker> It has to be <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . Yeah . You just drop the Okay and the Back . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ? Oh , that's for the speech . Speech recognition . Yeah . Could drop the speech recognition . <vocalsound> Right . S s Drop speech recognition ? <vocalsound> No but <disfmarker> Yeah that's possible . <vocalsound> We we d Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons . Buttons . Buttons . That's not very easy to use . Yeah . I No , it can be disturbed by by noise and No . Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works . stuff like that . <vocalsound> Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . Yeah . I have to look on that . Let me see . <vocalsound> Uh well no I was wrong . <vocalsound> There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . Yep . Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we <vocalsound> need a lot of <disfmarker> But if it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But it it <disfmarker> it's a it's a both a hypers We lose our whole concept . Uh so <disfmarker> No we just <disfmarker> Yeah . We need a lot of extra buttons . No , but <disfmarker> We keep the L_C_D_ . Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six . We uh we we haven't really integrated this <disfmarker> the speech into the system , Okay so we drop the speech . so we can might as well s drop that . <gap> And drop it yeah ? Yeah . Let's drop the speech . Yeah . Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . Sixteen Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We need to lose some buttons . But y y Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button <disfmarker> Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . Yeah . Yeah . Then you're <disfmarker> And then and then use um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh and the power button we have also . The the <disfmarker> Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then . Yeah . And then when you in the menu <disfmarker> So that's one Euro . S so so you activate the menu . If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah ? With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . And <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera . Yeah . <gap> . That would save zero point two Euros compared to <disfmarker> No . No it's three Euros . No ? Um <disfmarker> Yeah . No it's it's n Yeah . To This together is more expensive than <disfmarker> Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . Yeah yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Well okay . And we can drop these two . For example if you have f f four buttons , <vocalsound> channel up and down , uh volume left right <disfmarker> It's the <disfmarker> Volume . Okay , I've <disfmarker> I think we have to keep that . And the power button . And then <disfmarker> and the power button . So that's five . That's the basic . That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu . Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back . Or or under each option , you set a <disfmarker> you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . <vocalsound> So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . Yep . Which <gap> <disfmarker> That's even <disfmarker> But we can't drop three buttons . Okay th that's <disfmarker> But I see that's <disfmarker> Yeah that's one Euro more expensive . Yeah . So <gap> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that's not a good idea . <vocalsound> That's not an option . Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then <disfmarker> Menu , power . Yeah . F of the four things ? Four arrows ? Yeah , th power . Power . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Which more ? <vocalsound> Yeah , if you if you go to eight <disfmarker> I don't know how to <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . So four arrows ? Yeah . Uh power I believe ? Power . Th Yeah that's five . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> We have a Back and a Okay button . Yeah , okay that's seven , And the Menu . and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display . Oh , well okay . Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display . <vocalsound> The L_C_D_ ? Yeah . Let's make the <disfmarker> Yeah well we need the advanced <disfmarker> Let's make the case plastic . Instead of r Then I rather make it wood . Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but but that's not our market . True . But <disfmarker> No that <disfmarker> maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway . Ah no , hard plastic . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Plastic with a with a special colour . A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . Yeah , plastic with special colour . Yeah ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No but I I <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's an option . <vocalsound> Yeah okay uh <disfmarker> Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that . Yeah . Yep . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> So let's go for the plastic . So we do one one s Yeah . Yeah , okay . Plastic . And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ? Uh that's easy because plastic is free . <vocalsound> Hmm . Hmm . <vocalsound> We still have problem of two Euros . Yeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No the buttons , those are really needed . Yeah ? Yeah we can't drop them . Yeah th th it's it's uh <disfmarker> An advanced chip-on-print . <vocalsound> Yeah uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ? <vocalsound> You still need that . You <disfmarker> uh uh <disfmarker> Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and <disfmarker> Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . <vocalsound> S That doesn't matter . Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . No , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So <disfmarker> Well yeah . So the only option is an hand dynamo . Exactly . <vocalsound> Oh that <disfmarker> Yeah and something else . <vocalsound> Yeah but the <disfmarker> Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right . uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . And then if w And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . No y you would rec I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but <disfmarker> Then you have <disfmarker> Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . And uh <disfmarker> Yeah . For the volume . Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power . You can use those <disfmarker> Yeah . But the <disfmarker> Oh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost <disfmarker> Oh . Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now . But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ? Yeah . Three . Up , down , Okay . Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . Okay . You can go into you in you main menu , You you press it for like three seconds . you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options . Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen . Yeah . <vocalsound> Maybe we should . Yeah , okay . It would save enough <disfmarker> 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen . Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So we can maybe still use power button . <vocalsound> Yeah , but we'd <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright . Yeah . I guess we have to . It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . We'll we'll be on <disfmarker> Yeah . You see ? But we still have thirteen left . Oh still <disfmarker> Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah . Thirteen . So still half . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Shit . There goes the special co <vocalsound> Drop the special colour . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh no . Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That would make it less appealing . So that's no option . <vocalsound> 'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ? No no , it has to be um curved . We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? Yeah . Yeah it says right here . <vocalsound> They made it very easy for us . <vocalsound> Okay . Well yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature . Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Wh what we could do is um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons . Yeah . Buttons . That's <disfmarker> Oh yeah since we only have one button . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ? I just m I don't <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> Just something else than than black or white I think . Uh yeah it's <disfmarker> I think it's grey , regular . S yeah . Alright . Grey and rubber . But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . Of plastic . Yeah . Yeah . So I rather have an hand dynamo <vocalsound> than than drop the colour . <vocalsound> Damn . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah and then <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . You can still play with it then I guess . I don't know . Yeah . Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option . The display <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . Yeah . The <disfmarker> Yeah . But if you have to power the for ten minutes , <vocalsound> then the <disfmarker> I don't know . <vocalsound> Yeah . No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no . <gap> . Yeah . Yeah true . Yeah . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ? Or or do we <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No no it has to be curved . Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . Yeah . Yeah . Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something . Yeah . And a screen . Yeah . That's the most import Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ? Yeah or spe special form ? Yeah . S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form . Yeah ? Maybe that's nicer . It's for scroll <disfmarker> Yeah . But we don't have any buttons . Without <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So do <disfmarker> We only have <disfmarker> d Uh make it a special colour then . Yeah . But it's it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or <disfmarker> Yeah Yeah but <disfmarker> ma make it a special colour then . Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . Yeah ? Yep . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Woah we're within budget . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> It's a miracle . <vocalsound> Oh just <disfmarker> Let's let's save it . oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . Yeah . Okay . Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we <disfmarker> Yeah ? <vocalsound> Okay . Um , well <disfmarker> <gap> . 'Kay , this was old . Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah back to work Uh <disfmarker> . <vocalsound> It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . Did I save it ? Yeah . Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh yeah ? <gap> okay . Alright . Uh I just forgot to save this . Just a minute . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . Yeah what's the next uh phase ? Yeah , this the last phase of course , so <disfmarker> Uh the agenda . By your humble P_M_ . Hmm . <vocalsound> Oh f <vocalsound> Frustrated . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Yeah . Okay . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . <vocalsound> Drop everything . Yeah . Drop , yeah . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We went straight into finance ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah it was more important , so I just <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . For <disfmarker> Yeah . pushed up the agenda . Yeah . Uh , evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ? Yeah that that's <disfmarker> Yeah . I uh I sure did . And it combines with product evaluation . Uh so <disfmarker> Uh you put it in the <gap> . We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the <disfmarker> Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Yeah . Alright . <vocalsound> Let's make it big . <vocalsound> F_ five . Um <disfmarker> Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a <gap> scale , as we all know it . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . Alt up <vocalsound> Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No . And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ? <vocalsound> Freaky . <vocalsound> Oh . I don't know . Um <disfmarker> Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . How do you think about that ? <vocalsound> I think it does . Because the operating <gap> behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , right ? Yeah . Uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh <disfmarker> Yeah the us u It it <disfmarker> it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So do you think <disfmarker> Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So <disfmarker> Yeah . You can you can ma Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . Yep . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen . <vocalsound> I <gap> No . So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? Two or three . Huh ? Two or three . Two or three ? Something like that ? Well we have to choose one . Two . Yeah . So uh what do you say ? Uh y we should fill this in now . I agree on two . Yeah . Yeah okay . I uh I say two , personally . But <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two . Yeah alright . Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now . Okay then I say three . Yeah ? You say three , Yeah yeah . and you you said al also three ? Three ? Yeah . Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . <vocalsound> Hey , you're marketing , eh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's <disfmarker> nah , it's not very clear on the sc Hmm . M maybe underline . Or give it a colour . Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better . <vocalsound> Red . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore . <vocalsound> Oh yeah very true . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Alright . Yeah . Yeah true one . <vocalsound> Um well the remote control has <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Wha <vocalsound> <vocalsound> He types everything . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Definitely one . It has to be . Yeah . <vocalsound> The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings . It hides uh basic functions . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Everything . <vocalsound> You don't use anything else . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . <vocalsound> You're not gonna find them . Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah . Yeah true . But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> F I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case . Uh the second point . Yeah the next <disfmarker> Not so much so . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Nope . Power button . Do we ha still have a power button ? Uh check with the Excel sheet . Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ? Yeah . <vocalsound> I think we are <disfmarker> Yeah it's uh it's integrated . Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for <disfmarker> It's in <disfmarker> Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah . Yeah integrate it . Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then <disfmarker> E exactly just like a m mobile . Yeah . Yeah . I don't know . <vocalsound> Just go scrolling and it will activate . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Um it shows the relevant and most used functions . <vocalsound> <gap> . Yeah uh on the other <disfmarker> uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . So it's <disfmarker> I don't know . It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but <disfmarker> Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? Yeah . No , you have to scroll through the menu , before With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . Yeah . So it's it's not <disfmarker> And then <disfmarker> Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if <disfmarker> When it's on , yeah , it's turned on , Hmm ? You say you double click on the <disfmarker> It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , Yeah . but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . Of you <disfmarker> Or you double click it . But but how do you change from volume to channel ? No because it has four arrows , <vocalsound> right ? No , not anymore . No . <vocalsound> No . <vocalsound> Because he's <gap> now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick . Like on the the mouse . No we have n we have no buttons left . So <vocalsound> Say . the joystick was not an option . Yeah that is a bummer . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> so you hav <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , To get into menu . Yeah . and three double click for the menu , or something . <vocalsound> Oh no . <vocalsound> Or hold it ten seconds . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We'll make it a Morse code . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Alright . <vocalsound> But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . No no no . Uh it should be trendy . <vocalsound> So that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah but that that's not a question . <vocalsound> Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I think it's pretty much in the middle . Yeah . Four . You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So <disfmarker> Yeah , im <disfmarker> in the menu . Yeah . Seven . <vocalsound> So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or <disfmarker> Yeah . Five . Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah . Yeah . Five or six ? Five . Okay five . Five . Yep . Five ? Alright . Let's not diss our remote . Yeah . <vocalsound> It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yep . Just one button . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well it's different . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . But <disfmarker> Uh yep . Yeah . Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . Yeah , it's still <disfmarker> Yeah , I say two . <vocalsound> We still have the fruit and vegetable print . I say two then . Yeah . Yeah but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question . Oh , that's the next . <vocalsound> Fr Oh I mean the <disfmarker> Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost . <vocalsound> This one . I think a two . No . Two . Two yeah . <gap> . I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech <disfmarker> Yep . Yeah definitely . What ? Oh not the bold one . It's way more practical , yeah . Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . <vocalsound> It should have been two questions . <vocalsound> I realise now , because <vocalsound> sponge-like material is dropped . Yeah . <vocalsound> But the look and feel <disfmarker> You still have rubber d Or no . Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . No you got a plastic . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . The button has also colour . Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> The one button we have . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . The one . Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve . Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet . Mm mm . Yeah . You only have one <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah we have single curve now , And and colour . and no and no material Yeah . S . So maybe in the middle or something . Four . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I mean it's Yeah or three . <vocalsound> Uh <disfmarker> worth the <disfmarker> Yeah . We have something . Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . Yeah . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . New . Yeah . Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . Red . <vocalsound> Oh red . Yeah . You like both . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> I like bold . <vocalsound> Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo . <vocalsound> Um oh yeah . <vocalsound> Mm yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Of course . <vocalsound> I just couldn't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You just have to draw it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um , just one minute . Yeah but it <disfmarker> It's the white part uh <disfmarker> be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the <disfmarker> <gap> . Yeah . Yeah . So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But <disfmarker> We have a we have a <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , <vocalsound> if there's only one thing . Hell yeah . If we have only one button . Yeah . So I will say that is very true . <gap> . Mm-hmm . And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , doesn't it ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> The remote control is easy to use . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Well I would say <disfmarker> <vocalsound> No . Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . <vocalsound> The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . Ah i Yeah . And that you only have to control one button . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah exactly . It it it has a nice screen . But <disfmarker> Yeah . It gives visual feedback . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six . <vocalsound> I would say six . I think a five . Five . <vocalsound> What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? It's really not easy to use . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Cause you're putting everything <disfmarker> No not anymore . So a six , more . Yeah . Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Most votes count . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um well , another question , Yeah that looks uh great . uh the remote control is durable . <vocalsound> I don't know if that's the correct word . Yeah . Nah <disfmarker> Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic But uh <disfmarker> In use , both battery as casing ? <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah ? Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever . True , true . And the the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . And the casing is plastic , <gap> ? Yep . Yeah . If you don't drop it too much , it's uh should last pretty long . Yeah . So I would go for one . Yeah ? But uh I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate Yeah . S Yep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay yeah . than <disfmarker> Wow . <vocalsound> Yeah . Logo . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay I will go <disfmarker> go for two . <vocalsound> Uh the last one ? The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . <vocalsound> Oh . No m No we put the electronics into the fashion . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah well <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> I would g <vocalsound> <gap> uh <disfmarker> <gap> turn around . Yeah . But um <disfmarker> I would go for four . Yeah ? No <disfmarker> Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . It's not <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , true . Yeah okay . So a four . It's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . Yeah . But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah yeah . Yeah , four is okay . Alright , yeah . Right . So <disfmarker> So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . That's it . Ooh . And <disfmarker> Yeah ? What ? Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh <disfmarker> Alright . Word document , the <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah we have to count them . That <disfmarker> Count them . Uh <disfmarker> Add them ? Or <disfmarker> Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . Could somebody start calculator ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Mm . <vocalsound> I all made it po I I all made it Ah we can do the math . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . Mm-hmm . I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , Yeah , yeah . You have to <disfmarker> uh <disfmarker> Yes . 'Kay . Yeah . So four and <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Did you make this questionnaire or what ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Thanks . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Nice work . Okay . Oh . <vocalsound> Three plus ? I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . O one . Plus one . Plus five . Plus five ? <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> Easy . Bo <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Question number four , yeah ? Uh two . Yeah . <vocalsound> F Four . Oh . Wait a second . Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's it's gone wrong . <vocalsound> How hard is it ? Okay . It's your turn . <vocalsound> Yeah just use <disfmarker> Pretty difficult . Start over ? No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads . You can <disfmarker> No . That's why it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a it's a bit uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together . Yeah . I think you can just count them by a <disfmarker> Just count it to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Um let's move over . Okay . Three , four , nine . Three , plus one , four . Nine . Uh <disfmarker> Uh , yeah . Are you here ? Eleven . Eleven . Eleven , Fifteen . Fifteen . fifteen . Sixteen . Sixteen . Sixteen , yeah . Seventeen . Seventeen . No sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six . Oh what ? Twenty two . <vocalsound> S Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> How hard is this ? <vocalsound> Twenty two . Twenty two , yeah ? Never mind . Twenty four . Twenty six . Tw Twenty four . Twenty eight . Oh , sorry . <gap> . Twenty <disfmarker> Twenty eight . <vocalsound> Oh my . That was the last one . That was that . Twenty eight . Yeah . Okay . Twenty eight . So divided by nine . Twen Uh okay . By nine . Hmm . That's uh three uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Or le less than a three . So <disfmarker> Yeah the lower the <disfmarker> The lower the score the better , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Twenty eight Yeah but <disfmarker> Divided by nine . di divided by nine So thr t two . makes three point one one one one one one one . So we're better than average . But <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> I Are you sure we <disfmarker> this number actually tells us somethings ? No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . Some questions are <disfmarker> Yeah . So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low <disfmarker> the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question <disfmarker> Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . No ? Good example . Durable use . Durable , that's good . Easy to use . This <gap> is good . Easy to use . <vocalsound> Fancy look and feel , that's good . Yeah . <gap> . Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . Also good . Re relevant most used function . Yeah okay . I guess you did do it . And hides these functions . <vocalsound> That was also a good thing . Oh yeah . Yeah . Oh yeah yeah . No <disfmarker> And then matches the opera of the <gap> user was also a good thing . Yeah . Okay . Okay . So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So <disfmarker> Yeah true . Yes , so the <disfmarker> It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess . Oh great . Things , yeah . Yeah definitely definitely . Okay . Because now it's just an average <disfmarker> It's remote . Yeah . Nah it it's it's better than average , but <disfmarker> Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh <disfmarker> Yeah . So th It's still <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . Has some shortcomings . it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . No . <vocalsound> The colour and the screen . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um this we had , this we had . Product evaluation . We have to do a product evaluation . <vocalsound> Uh prototype presentation we dropped . So <disfmarker> Uh the finance we looked . We have redesigned . Uh not on that , but <disfmarker> Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay it's your turn now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . <vocalsound> Shall we try ? <vocalsound> With some casing around it , yeah . Black . Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? Yeah uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh <disfmarker> The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . Yeah . he only needs one button . One scroll button and <disfmarker> It's plastic . <vocalsound> And single curved . Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or <disfmarker> Yeah . Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED . <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> oh no . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well . For what ? Okay . Yeah . So that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Do we have to do other things ? Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . Or just redesign ? <vocalsound> Alright . And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . Yeah . So I <disfmarker> So you made a start , right ? Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . Should give it some time ? Yeah . Yay . Uh <disfmarker> Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? I was here . So <disfmarker> It's just one <disfmarker> Have to take this away also . Alright . yeah . Ah <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And this um <disfmarker> Uh that's the infrared uh <vocalsound> thing . <vocalsound> Oh yeah , of course . The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . Yeah . Um pen yeah ? Format . Current colour red . The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour Oh <disfmarker> Yeah we did our special colour for the <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . Line widths , now that's a ten . That's conceptual , yes . That's enough to get started with , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Um , uh it's just a scroll <disfmarker> Mm . It's gonna be one str scroll . How many pages ? <vocalsound> Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ? Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion . Alright . I think <disfmarker> Y you have you have done the first two . Horizontal's easier too , Yeah . 'cause you can <disfmarker> Okay , and and the look and feel is <disfmarker> Yeah . Is it more natural than this ? Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance . Yeah , yeah . So let's say <disfmarker> Whoops . 'Kay . Yeah . Yes . Basically . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It doesn't look like uh <disfmarker> The items we had to drop . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh it <disfmarker> it's it's not <disfmarker> Yeah . It's not very fashionable anymore . But uh it's okay . It's really ugly . Yeah . Where did we start with price ? Twenty six and a half . Maybe m make it bigger ? Or <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Or not ? Or twenty six ? Something like that . Yeah . That looks little bit more uh <disfmarker> Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it uh special ? <vocalsound> Oh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> This ? What do you mean ? Like a other colour than this one ? <vocalsound> Or or speckles in it ? I dunno . Uh <disfmarker> Speckles ? <vocalsound> Yeah can we do it uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> uh can we do a print ? I'm not sure . I think we have to choose , yeah ? ... . I don't think so , if you see the options . But <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Okay special colour . We do have special colour . Does it mean uh that <disfmarker> Yeah red is already a special colour , I think . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's not very special , but uh <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? Yeah . Purdy . Just uh put the purple uh purple on it . <vocalsound> Yeah . Some some big dots . Purple ? That's trendy . Yeah . Yeah yeah . Oh no my remote has acne . ... . We have the original balance sheet , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Woah . No . That's why we have that button . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh yeah . It's so cute . Hmm . Oh what ? Doh . Woah . <gap> ? <vocalsound> Just cut . Control Z_ . Oh no . <vocalsound> Is that that ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> No no . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . How the <disfmarker> We <disfmarker> did we do that ? Oh it's it's just one computer ? Or <disfmarker> Just dual screen . <vocalsound> No . But can we delete it , just with delete ? Or <disfmarker> We can try . <vocalsound> That doesn't respond also to the undo . It looks like it's <disfmarker> Crashed . <vocalsound> No , <gap> <disfmarker> Oh , no . <vocalsound> Very nice . Okay . <vocalsound> Where do you want some more dots ? <vocalsound> Yeah , over here . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Hmm ? You can't even draw anymore . <vocalsound> Yeah . Y y you you <vocalsound> Even children can draw . <vocalsound> What's this ? you push the button or something . Or <disfmarker> Can you just push pen and then keep on <disfmarker> Oh yeah . Oh that's the select button . It's uh <disfmarker> Hmm . Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know . No , it looks <disfmarker> It's not so random huh ? Lot of options . It's okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Specially the the R_ . <vocalsound> Yeah , the R_ and another R_ . <vocalsound> Yeah okay . It's called the Real Remote , right ? Yeah . Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote . Yeah just on the the m um the L_C_D_ display . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Welcome . <vocalsound> We can make a l a logo . This is your Real Remote . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Like uh <gap> put it like the shape . Yeah . D designed by <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Something like that . Okay . I mean it's not too uh <disfmarker> That's not their logo , is it ? No . Do they have a lo <disfmarker> Oh , the <disfmarker> here . This i this is the logo . Yeah . It's a <disfmarker> Two R_s and a one <disfmarker> Yeah . You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials . <vocalsound> <gap> . You can copy and paste the picture if you want . How <gap> <disfmarker> Shall we do the logo in black or not ? Mm . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> What is that ? Look more <disfmarker> Looks more like a campfire . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Are you dissing my drawing ? <vocalsound> This one ? Yeah . <vocalsound> It looks like a ribbon . <vocalsound> <gap> Yeah . Okay . So who wants to draw ? This is actually quite fun . Do we need to do anything ? I hear you people are typing . Are we uh ready ? Uh <disfmarker> Or <disfmarker> Type in your report . Oh , okay . I don't see any new messages . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Luckily . Hmm ? Luckily , yeah . Is this uh the last assignment ? Or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's uh Final <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah . It's almost four . What time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> At four , yeah , <gap> ? Or before that ? Okay . And copy this . Just compare uh <disfmarker> Just a minute . This is really bizarre . It's <disfmarker> It looks like there's a <disfmarker> It looks like a butterfly . Um bug . Bug . It's somewhere <disfmarker> I d It isn't inside . <vocalsound> No it's in inside the <disfmarker> Yeah , and don't know how it's <disfmarker> or eject it . No it's on the on the beamer I guess . No it <disfmarker> Oh . <vocalsound> No , but it i It's not a bu a beamer . From up there ? No . B It's a normal T_V_ screen , kind of thing . Hey , you've got it uh read only . Yeah it's somewhere in here . So you have to uh <disfmarker> Save copy . Yeah . Strange . This something what's projection from behind , I guess . Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> . <gap> . It's too uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh . Yeah there is some kind of projection I think . Yes . Yeah it it's a beamer , but then with a <disfmarker> With a with a mirror , huh ? Or something . within a mirror , yeah . Yeah . <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> . So it looks like a big screen , but <gap> <disfmarker> in fact it isn't . So are we gonna change anything to this ? It is <disfmarker> I mean is it gonna <disfmarker> Well it's it's single single curved . Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's now single curved . So <disfmarker> Th this is flat . Yeah . This is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly . It's flat . Oh no . <vocalsound> Okay . It doesn't matter . It's it's <vocalsound> <disfmarker> But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . <vocalsound> I mean you see more of this than of that . Yeah . Yeah , more like that . Yeah . And this is also gonna be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's not very uh ideal . <vocalsound> Nope . Do like this . But sometimes then uh all of a sudden it does work . Yeah . What's this ? <vocalsound> That's the detector uh for the <disfmarker> Ooh . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Maybe <disfmarker> But I don't see a detector over there . Yeah . I don't know . <vocalsound> No it's <disfmarker> I think you only need two points . Or not . No , you sh I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something . Maybe that's why it's it's not working , because it's more <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Slanted yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Or just messed it up . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well maybe . Oh . <vocalsound> Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing . Yeah . Yeah but it wasn't good . <vocalsound> You've to make it s uh ninety degrees . Yeah it it has to touch the corners , I guess . But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here . <vocalsound> Um now you probably have to recalibrate . You have <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . Oh . Oh we're always long . <vocalsound> And the recalibration is done using this icon here . Yeah , Ooh . can we t can we get to that <gap> i <vocalsound> Oh it's not working anymore . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah yeah , it's it's okay . It's working again . Yeah well I just <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah , it's it's working , it's working . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . It's better than before . <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . We're improving uh <disfmarker> Yeah . You go ahead . Yeah that's improved uh pretty much . Yeah . Yeah it's only a bit like to that side , Yeah . but that is that one by the way . Yeah but it's better , it's better <disfmarker> 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . No it <disfmarker> So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there . Mm . No . It's better than it was I guess . Mm-hmm . I will take this away 'cause it looks messy . <vocalsound> Silly . Yeah . Works pretty well . Five minutes before the meeting's over . Yeah . Yeah . And then ? We have to present <disfmarker> Then I have to uh uh write this , and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far . Alright . Maybe we will . Maybe we get a a final mail . So it <disfmarker> after the <disfmarker> after after these five minutes , you have to <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report . What's this anyway ? So cake . <vocalsound> Alright . After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or <disfmarker> It looks like candle wax . Yeah . Alright . And we uh <disfmarker> And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or <disfmarker> Right . Chill . <vocalsound> oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . Huh . You can just if you ma finish my presentation please . Uh over there . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah ? The presentation is still open . So if you finish that then you'll see uh <disfmarker> Yeah next . Next slide . Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly . Yeah ? Uh <disfmarker> How do you do it ? Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Alright . So how were <disfmarker> did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh <disfmarker> Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or <disfmarker> Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth . Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . Yeah . Yeah . And the third time yeah , I mean <disfmarker> And we move more to to working together as team , No . because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <gap> . No . Yeah , yeah yeah yeah . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , Mm-hmm . and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So <disfmarker> The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . Yeah we <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Especially after the first meeting . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah , especially if f f if you see <disfmarker> uh you se And <disfmarker> you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess . Yeah . Yeah . Definitely . Okay and was that due to my leadership ? Yeah yeah yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that <disfmarker> Yeah ? Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing . Yeah . Yeah . That okay ? <vocalsound> Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ? I guess so . Yeah . Yeah but only the the financial parts uh <disfmarker> I mean <disfmarker> Li Limiteded afterwards , Yeah . but <disfmarker> If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . I Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh We were pretty democratic . the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . So and the <disfmarker> uh about the board <gap> digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm uh I think in in essence Ooh . <vocalsound> the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . I mean uh uh I've made <disfmarker> Yeah it works . <vocalsound> yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . Yeah . So it it's better a better device than uh Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Maybe <disfmarker> Yeah . than the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . <vocalsound> It's uh it's <disfmarker> The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . <vocalsound> Use the pen . <vocalsound> And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . Yeah . But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . Or uh something like that . You can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the the logo and everything . Yeah yeah . And <disfmarker> I don't know . Yep . Blink . Oh . <vocalsound> Warning . Finish meeting now . Finish meeting . Okay , are are there <vocalsound> any new ideas about this ? All I think <disfmarker> I didn't really receive , yeah . Well , it <disfmarker> It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . <vocalsound> Uh uh w uh <disfmarker> And and S sorry uh <disfmarker> the <gap> screen and stuff like that . Mm-hmm . I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . It has to be uh <disfmarker> yeah . The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . Yeah . You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an <disfmarker> a small audience , and then to <disfmarker> Yeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But <disfmarker> Yeah . These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Yes . Check your email . Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> You also . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . Ah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Woah . Alright . Right . Okay . Uh okay . Okay . Alright . Yes boss . Well , s see you in a second huh ? <gap> . That's the management . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well see you soon . Oh . Okay . Hope so . <vocalsound> Yeah . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> we have to pull it this way , huh ? Wait .
Okay , good morning . This is our first team meeting . Good day . Morning . Morning . I'll be your Project Manager for today , for this project . My name is Mark <gap> will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off . <vocalsound> That's my uh that's the agenda for today . Well , of course we're new to each other , so I'd like to get acquainted first . So let's do that first , I mean <disfmarker> Let's start with you , can you introduce yourself ? You're our Marketing Expert . Yes . <vocalsound> Um my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld . Um I will be uh <gap> Pr Project <disfmarker> the Marketing Expert . And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project <disfmarker> product . <vocalsound> Okay , excellent . And you are User Interface <disfmarker> Nick Broer , User Interface Designer . Yeah . I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view . Excellent . Okay . My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is uh the apparatus made of , Hmm . and the third is what should it look like . What should it look like ? Okay . Hmm . Oh , let's kick it off . Oh , there we go . So , our new project is about <disfmarker> we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . It's <disfmarker> I think well it sums up what we need to do . We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need to <vocalsound> um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . Yeah . Yeah . So <disfmarker> So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design . Yeah . And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about <disfmarker> So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this . Uh . Okay . Every meeting we <disfmarker> everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have <disfmarker> we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's <disfmarker> actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . Like you see here , I'll just take the <disfmarker> take <gap> here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want . It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just <vocalsound> either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . So it should be really easy . Okay . This is to take the <disfmarker> just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be <disfmarker> it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out . <vocalsound> Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . So next , been here . <vocalsound> Well , <gap> gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . I think the creative genius should go first . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The creative genius ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thank you very much . So , draw us your favourite animal . <vocalsound> Well , <vocalsound> I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so I'm not really good at drawing animals , Draw us a technical animal . but uh the animal which I <gap> <disfmarker> Oh . Yeah , it's still erasing . <vocalsound> Pen . <vocalsound> Uh format . Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like <vocalsound> a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see . A head . <gap> actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very <disfmarker> Uh high-tech . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Bit low-responsive though . <vocalsound> So that's what we don't want . Prefer pen and paper . We want a high-responsive product . So <disfmarker> It looks more like nuclear bomb . <vocalsound> Very nice dolphin . It <vocalsound> <vocalsound> doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> This thing isn't doing what I'm <disfmarker> What I want . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> Let's go easy on it . <vocalsound> Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , <vocalsound> Anyway , but then again , this is all new for me . it should <disfmarker> It <disfmarker> It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it <disfmarker> that it represents . Uh-huh . Like the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an <disfmarker> What do you like ? Okay . Well , Now we can forget this ever happened . our Marketing Expert . Show us an animal . Um an animal . I like the elephant . <vocalsound> <gap> Pick a <disfmarker> pick a <disfmarker> pick a clean sheet . Oh . Take a clean sheet first . What ? Yeah . Um <disfmarker> Just press next . That's it . Oh yeah . Oh , a blank . Okay , next . Free , I like the elephant . It's big , it's strong , so uh uh <disfmarker> Oh , it's a little bit <disfmarker> It's not really that responsive , no . <vocalsound> You have to hold it , right ? <vocalsound> Mm . Hmm . <vocalsound> <gap> It's a beautiful animal . <vocalsound> Oh , you have to p press it pretty hard . With a smile on it , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a cute elephant . it's very important . Yeah . <vocalsound> And uh not to forget its tail . Oh . It's a nice beard . Yeah , it's okay . Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And you was making comments on my dolphin . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I will beat the dolphin . <vocalsound> No . Okay , so it's just a bee . Yeah . So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market . The big and strong player in the market . Yeah . Yeah . This would be good . Okay , excellent . On to the next one . <vocalsound> Okay . Uh yeah . Okay , you should press next . <vocalsound> Yeah . Press next . Yeah , it's up there . <vocalsound> Okay . That's it . Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger . <vocalsound> You picked a hard one , didn't you ? <vocalsound> Experience with the tiger . My drawing skills are really bad , so . <vocalsound> What ? They are <disfmarker> They are really bad , my drawing skills . Okay uh-huh . <vocalsound> Sure looks smooth . Oh . I'm not sure how the legs should go , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh these are stripes . Got it . <vocalsound> I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources . What does it want ? Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . Okay . And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , Mm . security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use . I agree . Okay . <vocalsound> Yay , I'm supposed to draw the animal next . I introduce to the world the amazing ant . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh hard worker . Great team-workers . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . So I'm gonna give it a smiley face . Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Oh . Not sure where the p <gap> . Just put 'em here . Whatever . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Think it need shoes . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's the coolest ant ever . You've done this before , haven't you ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . Anyway <disfmarker> Nah . <vocalsound> Just <disfmarker> I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take <disfmarker> just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us . Yeah . Just <disfmarker> Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway . <gap> another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now . Uh put this down . Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but <disfmarker> Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . So what do you guys think about <disfmarker> The first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? Well , I basically had a question . What <disfmarker> Do <vocalsound> uh <disfmarker> Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in Uh <vocalsound> <disfmarker> The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . Just for T_V_ remote control . Yeah . Yeah , I guess so . Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . But <disfmarker> Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . Yeah . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it <disfmarker> revolutionary changes , Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess . yes . <vocalsound> Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , <gap> and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ? Yeah , we want <disfmarker> I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So <vocalsound> I think <disfmarker> I mean , really disabled people , yeah , <vocalsound> might be a problem , but I think it's a little <gap> take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ? Hmm . Uh . Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . That's <disfmarker> Yeah . it speaks for itself , but some uh <disfmarker> It should be light , okay . Yeah . Yeah . Um , let's see , where did I <disfmarker> Let's skip that . Oh , this is it . Sorry , I skipped this sheet . Selling price . What do we <disfmarker> This <disfmarker> Quick <gap> <disfmarker> What we're going to <disfmarker> Selling price , twenty five Euros . That's for you . The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . <vocalsound> Okay . Just go go for that . We'll reach the uh reach that profit . Okay . Okay , well <gap> international . that's not that much to work with . <vocalsound> No , it's not much to work on . I'm sorry , I skipped it . <vocalsound> Anyways , that's <disfmarker> Yeah , this is it . Do you have anything you you came up with yet ? About uh marketing transfer , whatever ? Um about what ? Marketing ? Marketing <gap> I'm not sure what you what you came up with yet . You have anything to share ? Or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short <vocalsound> Um no , not really yet , since we're supposed to stop . but I've some ideas Okay . and I will uh say it uh <disfmarker> Anyways , the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything . So we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes . Okay . Okay . I'm sure we have that . Good luck everyone . Yeah , thanks for attending . <vocalsound> Mm , good luck . I'll see you back here in thirty minutes . Okay . Yes . <vocalsound>
Hello . Hey guys . Hi . Hi . Hi . I see my bunny is still standing . Yeah . No one drawing it . It's too beautiful . Yeah , true . <vocalsound> Uh I figured uh that much . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Too wicked . Mm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A minute please , my uh laptop is uh <disfmarker> oh , there it is , thank you . So welcome back . <vocalsound> At the functional design meeting um the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . I will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . <vocalsound> Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um <vocalsound> uh I had an email from the from the management board <vocalsound> uh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important . First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . <vocalsound> Uh second one is also important uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , <vocalsound> so uh that's one thing to keep in mind . <vocalsound> Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh <disfmarker> would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . Uh and uh I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . <vocalsound> So , we have uh forty minutes , so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh <disfmarker> whatever you want . So uh Tim , can you start ? Okay . Yeah ? <vocalsound> 'Kay , welcome . I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level , Mm-hmm . which I will show you . <vocalsound> The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . Um <vocalsound> one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . Um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . Um , we have three audiences of <disfmarker> two audiences , <vocalsound> I'm sorry . Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five <gap> age . Uh the second one is from sixty four <disfmarker> uh forty six to sixty five . Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent <disfmarker> um sixty five . Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . Mm <vocalsound> and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . I don't think that's uh really appropriate . Um , <vocalsound> and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh <disfmarker> Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . Second findings <vocalsound> out of the questionnaire um are the opinion <vocalsound> the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer . Okay , third findings . According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um <vocalsound> following buttons are most important . Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . Um , <vocalsound> persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , Mm-hmm . and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . Um , when you multiply them , you get the <disfmarker> these three points . Switching channels , um yeah , that's pretty uh pretty normal , that's what you do with a remote control . Um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want <disfmarker> wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . But it's strange that the the manage board <disfmarker> the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . Yeah , okay . So that that's strange . Yeah , okay , but uh at the moment uh teletext is <disfmarker> Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information . Yeah , okay . So uh , Yeah . when you ask people , what do they use , <vocalsound> they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . Okay . Yeah , okay . That's ridiculous . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's a ne i it <disfmarker> It's a new technology , but it's not incorporated right now . Yeah . Okay , my personal preferences . Um , I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . <vocalsound> Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . Um , yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . Um <vocalsound> second point , <vocalsound> we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . Third point um that came out of the uh <disfmarker> of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_ Yeah , that's a cool idea . where you can put the the remote control in . <vocalsound> Um , that's about it , I think . Yeah . When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that Uh not not the r not the functions , what what are you think about ? but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . <vocalsound> Uh , the funtionability . So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , yeah it's <disfmarker> Yeah . Ah okay , so focusing more on the used buttons . Yeah , they have to be on it Yeah . j just to t to get it done if necessary , <vocalsound> but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or <disfmarker> Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . Yeah , perhaps . Just for the minor functions perhaps . Thank you . Yeah , ma perhaps , just just an idea . Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . Yeah . Yeah ? 'Kay , that's it . Thank you , Tim . <vocalsound> Janus , can you uh <disfmarker> Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure . Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . Um right . Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh <gap> a cheap uh remote . Well uh as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth <disfmarker> Well it may be possible , but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in <disfmarker> within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . F because uh <disfmarker> well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth <gap> or or radio waves , <vocalsound> although <disfmarker> What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ? Yeah , actually I have t So it's in the wrong product . Yeah . Yeah , I actually <disfmarker> I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh <disfmarker> the infrared function . So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , Yeah . Yeah . but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost <gap> that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore . Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . Uh first you have the energy source . The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use <disfmarker> you could just go out and buy a new one . So we didn't <disfmarker> and we don't have to do all uh <disfmarker> to be too complicated about that . Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch <disfmarker> there is a switch uh between these . When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh <disfmarker> immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_ , so is is something wrong or something . So that's just to uh to to explain the <disfmarker> of <disfmarker> to to uh make it clearer to the user . Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . Uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh <disfmarker> well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use <disfmarker> you don't use them , so why why should we invent uh <disfmarker> w spend more time on those . Uh I I think we should stick by <disfmarker> with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . So uh no input from the television . So I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such . So I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and <disfmarker> Um , yeah , maybe another problem uh , I think current T_V_s can even send infrared . Yes , but what should we uh s I I I f I agree with you , but should we spend money or <disfmarker> and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? Huh . Mm-hmm . 'Cause that would be <disfmarker> I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control . Yeah . Yeah . These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . So I I <disfmarker> my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . Um , well Yeah . we should uh look into the design and the functionability . Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh <gap> stuff . And uh don't overbuild , we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . So that was my uh my personal opinion . And that was my uh my presentation uh <disfmarker> Okay . Okay , thank you Janus . Yes , I can go ahead . You do ? The last presentation . Last presentation . Okay . You have plenty of time , Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes , <vocalsound> so uh take your time . <vocalsound> <gap> If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh <vocalsound> warn you . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , <vocalsound> so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh <disfmarker> if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's that's some of the main points . And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time , Hmm . 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , Hmm . since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . Um well , of course I I hope this is all clear to you . If you <disfmarker> you can use remote like this with all the functions , <gap> many functions , but <disfmarker> Well , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . You have to be very careful what you push , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um <disfmarker> yeah well , where is it ? Where the hell <disfmarker> he here I guess and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . For example if you want to use a play and back and stop , that's very important . Um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it's no longer uh applying . <vocalsound> Well yeah , I prefer to use it only for T_V_ and um n uh not to give too many options and and if possible , uh the buttons should give <vocalsound> a dr direct action , not first select <disfmarker> Uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , Yeah , so uh and so that's where the difficulties lie . Yeah , you you want to keep it simple , but <disfmarker> but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one . Yeah , Yeah . Yeah , this <disfmarker> so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . but <disfmarker> Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , Mm-hmm . Okay . or do we want to use um many buttons . Yeah . So um weighing those factors . Hmm <gap> it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ <vocalsound> or a touch screen um , that in the middle are the the main keys , like displayed on the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh yeah . The <gap> doesn't <gap> . <vocalsound> <gap> . Yeah , this ? No ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Something like that . Okay , just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching , Yeah . and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or <disfmarker> that you can drop down . Yeah , but when all the questions I had <disfmarker> Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . Mm . Uh so that's my recommendation , Nah . if you use many options in one buttle <disfmarker> button , um display the menu on the T_V_ Mm-hmm . and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , Yeah . is too complicated for most users . Yeah . I think so too , Yeah , but <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ . Yeah , that will be a problem . Yeah . Well you d you have to <gap> keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not <disfmarker> our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . Yes . And that would be uh a considerable problem . So if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this . Yeah . Use big clear buttons . Not too many . So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important . Um <vocalsound> especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen . Not embed Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could <disfmarker> could make more menu up <disfmarker> pop up or something . And yeah , if you want to uh uh s put <gap> on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . Not first change menu options or switch something . Yeah . Um , well yeah , as you already told , give some feedback . Yeah . If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . And um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple . So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function <gap> on the the television , some you you'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it's uh important Yeah . if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important <disfmarker> um well you <disfmarker> we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . Yeah . Uh , I think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . Um , because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um and that's a big ad advantage I think , because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . Mm-hmm . It's uh very visual intended . <vocalsound> What was I to say more ? Maybe that's an option . Um keep the primary buttons visible . Yeah . Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . <vocalsound> But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear <vocalsound> and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um <disfmarker> Yeah okay , but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea Yeah . then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? The extra functions . The extra functions , Yeah , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , but l like menu functions or <disfmarker> Yeah . and then all all the options will become available Ah okay . and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . <vocalsound> Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet Yeah , I think so . and uh I'll just make um <disfmarker> uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with <disfmarker> or sub-items , sub-functions . Yeah . Well um then I'd like to make a proposal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> If you make one big touch screen , Yes . use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available Yeah . Yeah . and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . Yeah , yeah , Yeah . like like the iPod idea that that we just saw . Yeah . <vocalsound> You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several <disfmarker> you can also improve uh later on . Yes . Uh uh I think that will be great . Okay . So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . Yeah , I think so . Yeah , I wou I would actually go for the <disfmarker> Jirun ? Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . Yeah , of course . Yeah . Yeah . And so um an elder designer picks up th the <disfmarker> of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah . Yeah , I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um , Mm-hmm . like building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh Yeah . but children uh <disfmarker> if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or <disfmarker> Yeah wh Is that possible to use or no ? That is possible , that <disfmarker> well Th there's just <disfmarker> that actually depends on the television , but I think <disfmarker> I figure that would be <disfmarker> Well , yeah well , does it have to depend on the television ? Ju just a simple log-in , something like that . Well , Yeah . y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , Yeah . the the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in a preset order , Yeah . so uh if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay . so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern . Yeah . Yeah . Well , I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh <disfmarker> make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh <disfmarker> change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume Yeah . and uh <disfmarker> Yeah , th that kind of stuff , but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels Mm-hmm . Yes . and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , that's uh vi violent channel , Oh , something like that . Yes . uh m my ki my kids uh <disfmarker> I don't want my kids to watch that , Yeah . then you set the priority to only parents , <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay , yeah . Well Yeah , b but make it a separate option in the menu , for example . that would b But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , that . so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh <disfmarker> displayed here , Yeah okay , but but <disfmarker> yeah , that's just so uh that's an a an added feature . parents uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay . But let's not uh go too wide about the <disfmarker> those things , that's that why we're here . Yeah , <vocalsound> th th those things are nice . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel <vocalsound> later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p Partial . yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals Yeah . uh and uh <vocalsound> the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , Mm-hmm . but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . Yeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers Yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style . that's just as e just as easy . Uh . I I do <disfmarker> You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true . Uh I do agree , Yeah . because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button , Yeah , okay . but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . Yeah , it's different . W we are aiming for younger people Yeah . Yeah , that's true , yeah . and they they chose <disfmarker> Yeah , age b below forty . Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep . So that's that's probably uh a <disfmarker> And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , Mm-hmm . They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true . so <disfmarker> A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . Mm-hmm . Mm <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay , I th I think we can do that too . as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh <vocalsound> are done . <vocalsound> Done . <vocalsound> Uh I've uh added the <disfmarker> this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . Mm-hmm . Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . Uh so that can be uh can be read out . Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um <disfmarker> Moment . Ooh . Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh <disfmarker> we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't <disfmarker> uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh <disfmarker> um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically <vocalsound> each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the <disfmarker> done by the remote control and not by the television . I think that's the point what uh Mm-hmm . Yes . we discussed . Yeah , yeah , some of them . The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ . Well you can use um <disfmarker> when you <disfmarker> <vocalsound> uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ , Yeah , but that's not possible . then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume Mm-hmm , mm yeah . and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from <disfmarker> ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable <disfmarker> the <vocalsound> capable from the t Yeah , but you have uh uh an <disfmarker> Add th that that's an opportunity <gap> . yeah , but you have an international market range , so you have I think a big range of <disfmarker> Well there are universal d um um remotes Yeah . and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . Yeah . Okay . But they <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> And it's not too complex to do it . <gap> Well No . they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ Yeah . and that that is bit of a tricky job . Yeah . I actually use one of those when <disfmarker> They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , Yeah . Well <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh um mo and that's well <disfmarker> No no no . no , you can just say uh the c <vocalsound> He he he he me he means just just one other thing . Just build it in . Yeah . Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press <disfmarker> yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ . Yeah . Yes . In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . You look up , I have a Philips H_ fifty five Yeah . Yeah . and it says press code four five five Oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh <disfmarker> and you press code four five five on the <disfmarker> uh in the remote Yeah yeah yeah . and it displays all your uh menu options . Oh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah . Yeah . Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in <disfmarker> just just in the memory , Memory in the in the remote . Yep . Profiles . so that if you <disfmarker> yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh Yeah . the memory uh pops up the options . Yeah . Yeah , that would be possible . Yeah , sure . Okay . I th don't think that's uh <disfmarker> that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . No , that wouldn't be uh <disfmarker> Yeah , a few variables . Yeah , well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up , Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . so uh I think uh it is possible <gap> . Ah it is . It is definitely po But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote <disfmarker> We have five minutes to go . Yeah . Well then you have to buy a new one , it's very good for marketing New remote ? Maybe , or an update , software update . A firmware upgrade or something , Firmware update , you say . Yeah , firmware upgrade . but from where ? Ah . Maybe w That's maybe the cup holder . No m may no , Yeah . maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . Well , not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home . Well the most most people have , Well , but not not everybody at <disfmarker> uh you can go back to the shop and <disfmarker> and uh they <vocalsound> <disfmarker> Yeah , like a s kind of service centre . Yeah . Yeah , ser o Yeah , maybe something like service cen and they can download it for you . Yeah . Or you could <disfmarker> well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T_V_ uh connections , Yeah . you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they <disfmarker> we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh <disfmarker> Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh <disfmarker> well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , Receiving . Oh yeah . Yeah . we could actually look at <disfmarker> into it , Yeah . but <disfmarker> I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs <gap> uh with with it Difficult . and <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> I I think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop . Yeah , that would be probably best , yeah . Yeah yeah , uh s I think some <disfmarker> I think it's good idea , yeah . Yeah . Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask <disfmarker> well I'll <disfmarker> It's it's it's not a lot of work , just one uh docking station where you put it in , Yeah . press start , bling bling , updated . Yeah , that would be best , yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so . Okay , No no . Exactly , so <disfmarker> let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh <disfmarker> Um m for which one are we going ? <gap> My mistake . Let's vote . That one or uh <disfmarker> Yeah , my vote goes out to the right <gap> . Your vote and your <disfmarker> My vote too . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> And your vote ? Well , I was uh doubting about which one to take , but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do . Yeah . Yeah . And also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open . Opens up Flips open . is too difficult or uh <disfmarker> Uh too difficult , um maybe uh it's easier to break it . N yeah . Break it , I don't get <disfmarker> Yeah , th th th that i uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . It's very sensitive . Oh so <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Like my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too . Yeah . Yeah . Okay well uh it's almost at the end . So we have now a lunch break , finally , Ah . yeah . <vocalsound> Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes . Uh I will put my minutes <disfmarker> uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too . Thirty minutes ? Thirty minutes , the <disfmarker> How minutes ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Failure . Uh <vocalsound> uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will <disfmarker> all will receive uh at the uh the the email . I don't think I can uh say much about it , so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes , and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes . One question , Yeah ? uh how late do we have to get back <disfmarker> be back here ? Uh well uh thirty minutes . A quarter to one maybe ? Uh , yeah . Thirty minutes lunch break ? Thirty minutes lunch break , yeah . Okay . I thought forty five . Oh . Forty five ? Yeah . Uh then would it be uh one o'clock . Yeah . Okay . Or we we ask our personal coach . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Thank you . Thank you , uh that was a very uh good session I think , <gap> Yeah , we uh we <disfmarker> is it possible to store this on the share documents or what <disfmarker> Yeah , me too . Uh ye well <disfmarker> Save as . Yeah , because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh X_D_K_ Yeah , v and that's in <disfmarker> But but you can open a <disfmarker> from your pr from your laptop . 'Kay , save it as an image on the res Yeah , maybe . Save as . Export . Maybe not export function . No . No . Export . Well I can I can uh <disfmarker> Export H_T_M_L_ . No , and use an image if possible . Huh , image ? J_ PEG . <vocalsound> G_ <disfmarker> yeah , J_ PEG . J_ PEG . Yeah , it's better Paper size A_ four . Uh screen size . In this directory . Yeah . N oh . Oh yeah , it's not connected to the You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work . to our P_C_s . No ? Yeah , it is connected . It's connected ? Yeah , I think so . To room . Deskt Huh . No . I'll just uh saved in my documents . Oh . <vocalsound> Yeah <vocalsound> in my own uh <disfmarker> in my own messenger . Yeah . Project documents , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . It gives the na Oh . Yes . Okay , nice . Okay , thank you . The questionnaire , fill in <disfmarker> uh we fill out d after lunch or uh <disfmarker> Uh well , it's it's simply filling <disfmarker> oh no , it's uh it's also filling out <disfmarker> no , I'd do it after lunch I think . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Aye , cheers . <vocalsound> I'm hungry , so do it after lunch . Yes . <vocalsound> Thank you all . Thank you . You're welcome . We can leave the P_C_ on I think , yeah and return to the <disfmarker> Yeah , of course . Yeah . Well I bring it to my uh personal room . <vocalsound> Yeah , bring to <disfmarker> To my exave executive <disfmarker> <gap> I gotta bring it home . My executive uh big room with the with the panting . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A big office . <vocalsound> Yes . Aye . Yeah . Okay . <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> <gap> <vocalsound>
Okay everybody is ready ? <vocalsound> Good morning again . So , today we are going to have a f second meeting . Oh Michael , hi . Yep . You're late . You have a good reason for that ? <vocalsound> Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Very good <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today . <vocalsound> So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to <disfmarker> through the minutes of previous meeting . So uh <vocalsound> basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for <disfmarker> about that topics . I goin I'm going to share with you . <vocalsound> And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . Yep . You showed us <disfmarker> you ar you you prepare something for us ? Yeah . Yep . The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs . Mm . Alright <vocalsound> so <vocalsound> so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of <disfmarker> to give a name to the project . So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should <disfmarker> we could discuss quickly . Any ideas ? Mm-hmm . Uh the Powerstick . <vocalsound> Powerstick , yeah . <vocalsound> What else ? What else ? Uh . <vocalsound> Maybe a Spanish name would work well . Mm I was thinking of the <disfmarker> Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . Mando . Mando . What is that ? Mango ? Mango ? Mando . Mando . M_A_ ? M_A_ ? A_N_ yeah D_O . M_ D_O_ . Mm , okay . It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me , What does it mean ? but maybe for a Spanish <disfmarker> for I <disfmarker> for <disfmarker> Oh . What does it mean in Spanish ? Control . Control . Hmm . Nice . Okay . 'Cause it also <disfmarker> like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote But <disfmarker> mm , yeah . so it might <disfmarker> Mando sounds Latino . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The Mando . Okay . <vocalsound> So , let's go for Mando ? Yeah ? No objection ? Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's <gap> . Great . And we could have some like you d So <disfmarker> you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like <disfmarker> Okay , I think this is <disfmarker> Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though , Okay . do you ? So <disfmarker> Yeah they are the most T_V_ watcher . So we should be careful . Yeah . Okay , I think this is more a question of of <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> yeah Marketing . it uh <disfmarker> I I think this is more a question of of look and feel . Something that should be addressed later We should we should go to other <disfmarker> for the other topics . Yeah because if the product will be international <disfmarker> Well that's the thing . We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a <disfmarker> Yeah okay , so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name Um . and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . So let's go for the three presentations right now . So , who want to start ? <vocalsound> Maybe maybe I should uh start . So maybe we could start with the market , yeah . Yeah . Mm . Okay . Okay so I have your slides somewhere ? Yeah . Should be in participant four . Participant four . <vocalsound> This one ? Yeah , yeah . <vocalsound> Uh . S that's coming . Uh <gap> Yeah . Yep . okay . Great . Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting . Mm-hmm . For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . And also I di I did a study with <disfmarker> for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been <disfmarker> have remained the same for the last five , ten years . There is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Sh next slide ? Okay . Well <vocalsound> <vocalsound> more <disfmarker> most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a <disfmarker> with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . They are also <vocalsound> <disfmarker> they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to <disfmarker> any beep any alarm or something incorporated to <disfmarker> with the remote control every time it it get lost . Mm-hmm . And also I found that young people <disfmarker> the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . Okay . So <vocalsound> <vocalsound> in my opinion the Mando <disfmarker> this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like <disfmarker> the the liklier it is to get lost . Liklier or more likely ? More likely . <gap> <gap> likely . Okay . Uh <vocalsound> people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but <vocalsound> they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . So it may be interesting to to think in a <disfmarker> in both prototypes , for right and left handed people . Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe <vocalsound> Yeah . cut out some <disfmarker> a lot of your market . I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some <disfmarker> a a small fraction of of this remote controls . Well maybe it could be a universal design . Sorry ? A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . Yeah . Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ? Yeah ? That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , Yeah . but but <vocalsound> don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ? Sorry ? The first and the third point , they are clashing . Well it can still be a <gap> , you can still extend past the hand . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Like uh <disfmarker> Uh . So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then . Well it means <disfmarker> like , this remote here is kind of <disfmarker> is very thin and long so instead of having <disfmarker> you know you might have it kind of <disfmarker> a bit bigger Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Yeah , like <disfmarker> or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something . Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . <vocalsound> So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? <gap> Little sleek , longer ? <gap> No no And it should fit the hand . I was thinking of so like something <disfmarker> Something with the shape of the palm ? yeah . Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . Some finger grips maybe . Yeah . You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , On the sides . Yeah yeah . It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . but <disfmarker> Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm . Not anymore . That's what <disfmarker> yeah . And then finally <disfmarker> And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget would be large enough . Yeah . Yeah . First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff But most of <disfmarker> yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . because uh because <disfmarker> Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh <vocalsound> to bring you to some new uh new informations . We had the new requirements from the <disfmarker> so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted <disfmarker> so they want to um <disfmarker> they would like to be restricted to T_V_ . Yeah . Okay , I dunno if you had this information already . No . No , so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations . Um they want also uh <disfmarker> Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls . Excellent . So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now and uh finally , <vocalsound> it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . <vocalsound> I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point So <disfmarker> because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price if if we're <disfmarker> maybe I can get to this in my presentation though , but um yeah . Yeah yeah . Sure sure . So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . Yep . Okay . Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that <disfmarker> this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco Yeah . I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think <disfmarker> if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Sorry , what is your <gap> ? Uh participant three . You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so . Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so <disfmarker> yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ <vocalsound> sound turns off . <gap> <vocalsound> Yeah uh channel fifty . Yeah . No it could be command control kind of thing . It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . Means you say <disfmarker> you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . Yeah . Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . Yeah . So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . Mm . Yeah . It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . <vocalsound> Otherwise it's just lying idle . Okay Michael . Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe <gap> be easier to <disfmarker> Sorry ? could I use the mouse , or <disfmarker> Um yeah . Mm . Thanks . Okay . The wheel doesn't work . <vocalsound> Great <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really <disfmarker> it's by no means uh mm you know <vocalsound> on it's own in being so expensive . There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . <gap> Looks like a P_D_A_ <gap> ? So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> yeah it doe it's <disfmarker> well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions <disfmarker> d different functions on the screen at different times . But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which I think is <disfmarker> it's a really kind of important design aspect um is <disfmarker> it's <disfmarker> 'Cause the thing is what a <vocalsound> what we <disfmarker> the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . Change the channels . Yeah . Now um uh the <disfmarker> I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . I usually use the up and down Yeah yeah . because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh <disfmarker> it's annoying . So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability . Mm-hmm . One possibility , if we <disfmarker> now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . So if you think about <disfmarker> it's kind of like a <disfmarker> you know in mobile phones now you don't use <disfmarker> you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . <vocalsound> So this would be pretty <disfmarker> kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price . So , I mean there are <vocalsound> there are uh cheaper <disfmarker> this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions . It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . And <gap> was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . But there is one problem <gap> then the user has to understand each of that functionality . So <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah well we w Because the same button is doing too many things . Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> I I would <disfmarker> if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . Mm-hmm . They don't really do anything . Maybe you know I <disfmarker> although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . Um <disfmarker> H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the <disfmarker> see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to <disfmarker> very different build <disfmarker> very different to the traditional <disfmarker> It does sampling out of the <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well I guess that depends on how you market it . If you <vocalsound> if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . If y Okay , can you continue , please Mi ? So , but <disfmarker> <gap> yep . Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this <disfmarker> a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh <disfmarker> something that would be worth implementing . Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . I think even that , <vocalsound> I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , Mm-hmm . um but I think that would be quite useful as well . And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one <disfmarker> maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of <disfmarker> you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's <vocalsound> extensible to do other tasks . Say you have like um <vocalsound> a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you <disfmarker> also , selling the potential of the device . Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as <disfmarker> at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay , thanks . <vocalsound> <gap> you want to go ? Yep . So <disfmarker> yeah . <gap> <gap> So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I <disfmarker> This one ? yeah , it should be . Great . No , not that one . <gap> you are two . Two . Alright . <vocalsound> Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing <disfmarker> doing some he is knowing about that technology . So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being <disfmarker> sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . That's right . So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , Okay . so th that is a possibility . These could be other kind of interfaces . Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . <vocalsound> So spe buttons are something which is very <disfmarker> everybody is familiar with . So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , Mm-hmm . and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking . Otherwise we are just like others in the market . So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . Yeah . That increases the the cost also . Uh that's right . But uh means we have to see how much <disfmarker> what kind of microphones and stuff like that . Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well <disfmarker> of such technologies is enough ? Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . Okay . Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones Hmm . That's right . because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . No it it could be little d yeah it could be <disfmarker> So it could be s a few centimetres . <vocalsound> Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , That's right . That's right . because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries . Yeah . So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for <disfmarker> Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and <vocalsound> it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller . Yeah . Okay . Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide . Yeah , that's right . Yeah . So we can This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion . That's right . Yep . Okay , next . Yep . Uh that finished ? No no . Components . No ? Components ? Yeah . So , will you go to the next slide ? <vocalsound> Yes sure . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . We are having a power button and the switch <vocalsound> , which is not much , <vocalsound> and then we are having the <gap> which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . And then there are two kind of things which can be <disfmarker> so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> So we could not put that . So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . Okay . So this is the easiest design the there could be . So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in <gap> . To have different technologies . So this was the <disfmarker> my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know <vocalsound> turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button Yeah . <vocalsound> like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah . So these are the slight problems . So your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ? Because <disfmarker> yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means <disfmarker> though I don't have much idea , but as he <disfmarker> the uh Marketing Expert presentation was <disfmarker> I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo <vocalsound> everyone will s will buy it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Actually I'm not so sure <vocalsound> So if we go with just the <disfmarker> I'm sure . because I'm the <disfmarker> you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm <disfmarker> instead of pressing up on on a remote control . You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , Yeah . so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . <vocalsound> Okay so <disfmarker> Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well it depends if it's a remote control th it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . <vocalsound> If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be <gap> . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . Alright . Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . We are targeting T_V_ . <vocalsound> We need <vocalsound> we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . Um we have <disfmarker> With a good shape for the <disfmarker> or good shape , yes . We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . Maybe this is something we can stick to it . And um <vocalsound> also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the <disfmarker> one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ <vocalsound> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ <disfmarker> in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback <disfmarker> to to give some feedback informations about what we could have . Well it depends though <disfmarker> well it depends . If we we don't <disfmarker> unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of <disfmarker> something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . So that's an extra <vocalsound> Yeah that's right . Don don't you ha cost . don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or <gap> well systems that exist that we can use ? Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . Are we still <disfmarker> you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? Yeah . 'Cause that really makes a big difference . 'Cause <vocalsound> even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . Yeah . That's good point . It's it's not really gonna <disfmarker> What's what cou what could be the cost of uh <disfmarker> well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ? For twenty five Euro ? <vocalsound> I think it's impossible . Yeah . It's not possible . It's impossible . But but I dunno , Yeah . I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that <disfmarker> any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh Uh <disfmarker> of increasing the unit price . What would be <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is <disfmarker> which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um <disfmarker> in terms to had <disfmarker> to have really an added value ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah because <disfmarker> Okay , yeah . so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is <disfmarker> Wha but what would be <disfmarker> one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ? Well th What what kind of information ? 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the They have tele teletext . Well , because they have teletext on it . the n Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel . Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays . They have t most of them have teletext , Yeah . but we want to get rid <disfmarker> well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . So to to uh You can get a lot more information on it . to browse more easily the teletext . For instance through uh through your remote control . So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh <disfmarker> o You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something Okay . so you can quickly just kind of <disfmarker> even without reading <disfmarker> Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also . Well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . Are <disfmarker> They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . There's <disfmarker> dependi it also depends on the country . Well because <disfmarker> <vocalsound> for the same reason that we cannot uh <gap> informations on the T_V_ <gap> . We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there . No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh . So <disfmarker> so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to <disfmarker> But <disfmarker> Yeah . Well I I think if we're gonna <disfmarker> I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . <vocalsound> I dunno . We need to find that out . Okay . <vocalsound> We need to close the meeting . Um <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> But <vocalsound> just a small thing , what kind of market we are targeting ? Very quickly . Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or <disfmarker> because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . That is very important . No . Mm . If it's a really small T_V_ maybe <vocalsound> . Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their <gap> , <vocalsound> Broke . Okay . Okay . and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay . So this is <disfmarker> that we z that that we should target . So the com the um <vocalsound> the uh <vocalsound> the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . Mm-hmm . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . It is up to you to go through this um <vocalsound> uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . So I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the <disfmarker> than the L_C_D_ . It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ . Yeah , but not sure . Maybe it's cheaper , but we have no <disfmarker> Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . You need a internet connection . You need m more things . <vocalsound> But for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop You just say channel fifty , and that's it . I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a <disfmarker> you know . But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , Means th yeah twenty five Euros is <disfmarker> yeah , that's right . Well this is what we need to find out . it's <disfmarker> Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 'Cause otherwise we need <disfmarker> Okay this is <gap> <disfmarker> this is an open question for you . Yeah . This is uh up to you to tell us . But I'm definitely not keen on to to <disfmarker> To move to another target ? no no no , I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . I'm not confident enough . I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work . I uh that work <disfmarker> It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna <disfmarker> It's real yeah . How to guarantee such performances is really hard . <gap> <gap> the expert uh said ninety five percent <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> Ninety five percent is not good enough though . Well this is still <disfmarker> is is very bad . <gap> So , this is the end of this discussion . Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . Um <vocalsound> so you have to work on the component uh concept . Okay . Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . Okay . So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing . Um uh we <disfmarker> I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . Thanks . Yep . Bye .
Hello . <gap> . <gap> . Yes , I made it . English from now on <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . <vocalsound> Drawing or <disfmarker> Yeah just testing . Yeah . Mm ? Just kidding . English . <gap> . So annoying . Break is over . Ooh it works . Whoo . <vocalsound> Spicy . <vocalsound> Spicy . Where are are all the other presentations ? I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be <disfmarker> The conceptual or <disfmarker> yeah I think so . Yeah , conceptual design . Ah . Because I see only my own presentation <vocalsound> <gap> What or whatever does it <disfmarker> No no no , <vocalsound> can you go back one ? yeah . Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it . This ? <gap> I'll just put it in there . So , he's coming . <gap> . <vocalsound> I did get a bit more done than the last time , Or not . Okay . Oh okay . 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ah , I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but <disfmarker> Ah . She <gap> . You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . Move to meeting room . <vocalsound> Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , Yeah . Oh . and also with <disfmarker> I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . Yeah me too , <gap> . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I've got the same problem as well . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Here we go again . Welcome . Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh <disfmarker> f the remote control has to support . Thi So who wants go . Mm-hmm . Yes . Who wants to start ? Yes ? Me first again or <disfmarker> Yeah sure . Doesn't matter . Oh . No . Yeah . No problem yeah . Alright . Did you open it already or <disfmarker> No . no . Ah . Ah . Yes . So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . Um this time about trendwatching . <vocalsound> Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . Uh it shows a number of developments . Uh I will address them uh in a moment . Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . So um the developments I will address them <disfmarker> <vocalsound> oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . So to give you an idea . Um well the developments ? Uh development one . <vocalsound> Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , Sound . so I don't expect that to be a problem . Yeah yeah uh uh . And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . Um <disfmarker> Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . So um that kind of gets you this ratios . Mm-hmm . So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention . <gap> . Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . So my point of attention is especially this part . That this will be a crux . Yeah . So that was the marketing uh presentation . I had only one document left . And shall I go first ? Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind . So I <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> So kind of this <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah yeah sure . No . Yeah ? Do you want to go first ? Okay . <vocalsound> So a k a small example . <vocalsound> Yeah . Kind of this this look . <vocalsound> Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours Yeah . I dunno . <vocalsound> Just made a quick design . <vocalsound> Cool . It's better than than my uh drawing . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ? Alright . <vocalsound> Yeah okay but I have to design the <disfmarker> Uh components . Yeah layout . Yeah . Oh no . Yeah okay . Yeah . It's okay . You probably opened it . Yeah true . Um <disfmarker> F_ five . F_ five . <vocalsound> Alright . So <vocalsound> I'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . That's why I had to , wanted to go first . Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type . If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can <disfmarker> and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . There is a lot of um <vocalsound> factors involved in choosing the components . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . The basic battery . Uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . Yeah . Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . <vocalsound> Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . And uh of course solar cells . But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . Wi an indoors . So uh my <disfmarker> Oh . Yeah okay . yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . Calculator's can do it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . So that's not cool either . Mm-hmm . So um <vocalsound> for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . Or the double curved . Um <vocalsound> I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . Yeah . Uh the case materials . Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . Yeah . Um poo , this is a lot of text . I wasn't able to organise this yet . We have yeah several uh interface designs . Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . Yeah . Pushbuttons . Yeah . So that's not really interesting . Yeah . Electronics ? Yeah , <vocalsound> maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use <gap> the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . I think this is about it . Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . As an optional uh feature . Yeah . Or combine uh both with a with one uh I guess we can only choose one . Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the <disfmarker> Yeah maybe we <disfmarker> Okay . I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . Yeah . And it's more fun . Yeah I didn't receive any info uh . And it's also more fun yeah . I always chuck my uh remote control around , so <disfmarker> Yeah , just playing with it Yeah . and <disfmarker> especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , S yeah it's safe . <vocalsound> And throw it <gap> . Yeah y exactly . so it's a perfect combination I guess . You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . So that's the end of it . Yeah . So <disfmarker> Uh go ahead . 'Kay next . So double curved is like this , this , this , or <disfmarker> No it means curved in two dimensions . So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . Mm . Yeah . And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah . Also in in height ? Uh <disfmarker> Yeah okay . Okay . Yeah . Can we uh <disfmarker> One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . We were going to use that . Yeah . Yeah . So um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control . Design ? Well the visual representation is not there with speech No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and <disfmarker> but you can <disfmarker> Yeah . So okay . Just <disfmarker> yeah . I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . Yeah . Okay . So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . Yeah with the programme . But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? Both . For for everything , also for the advanced options ? Okay . Yeah . Uh we have this <gap> very uh basic uh trendy design . Everybody says it so that's what's uh <disfmarker> yeah um <disfmarker> Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . That's yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control . And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options . And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess . Yeah . Yeah . Um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout . Yeah . Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . That would be the back . I'm <disfmarker> The back . Yeah . Back and okay . <vocalsound> Back and okay . Back and okay yeah . Uh <disfmarker> You did read the minutes I wrote ? What ? You did read the minutes I wrote ? A little bit I think but not not everything w I <disfmarker> Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So <disfmarker> Okay . Oh <vocalsound> I uh didn't read that . I hate doing work for nothing . <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons . Um <disfmarker> I wanted to to categorise everything . Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . Mm-hmm . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous <disfmarker> so that's an a also an option . Um that was it . <vocalsound> That was it ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Okay . Uh <disfmarker> <gap> again . Ugh . <vocalsound> Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . No . Uh the case would be doubly curved . So <disfmarker> Rubber material . And rubber . Rubber material . Rubber material . And that's the only thing we have left . Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function . Oh okay . No it's easy . <vocalsound> So that's uh <disfmarker> is that is that the advanced chip ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Advanced chip . Okay . Wow . Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more . Yeah . Alright . Kinetic . Double curved . I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , Too <gap> . to be able to m Uh I didn't get any info on this . So <disfmarker> <gap> . So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . That's gonna be difficult huh ? The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? I have total here . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah I don't know . I didn't get any information about that so <disfmarker> <gap> . We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem . Yeah . <vocalsound> Child labour man , we love it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , so it's cheap . Who doesn't . Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ? Um well the interface type supplements . Yeah the interface , maybe can <disfmarker> Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh <disfmarker> yeah . Ooh . No . Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . Um let me see . Wait a sec . If you go to your homepage or something , you should Yeah I'm going there now . get your own information . Inspiration . I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Ah you didn't draw it yourself . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> No . <vocalsound> Ah . <vocalsound> Too less time . Um <disfmarker> Yeah , also the menu . yeah maybe it's <disfmarker> Yeah that that w Yeah . This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at . Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . Maybe it's easier <disfmarker> Yeah . Arrow . Arrow yeah . So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah perfect . So <disfmarker> Yeah . <gap> . Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . 'S the target group . S yeah . S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . Oh yeah . Yeah sure . <vocalsound> It's like really basic . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . This is what we're looking for . And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . Oh okay . I see . Not only like this but it has to be <disfmarker> Yeah also like this . So you can hold it . exactly . It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know , where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And <disfmarker> Yeah . But it has also to <disfmarker> it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So <disfmarker> It ha <gap> . The children's story . Yeah I've got it . Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , Distinction . Yeah . 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . And <disfmarker> Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , Yeah . The colour <disfmarker> Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with <gap> LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . you know , with the <disfmarker> If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it . Mm-hmm . Mm . There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . Yeah . Maybe we should consider this function . Mm-hmm . To customise it and so <disfmarker> I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours Yeah . and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour Different . Mm-hmm . like uh for example this uh photo th camera . Camera . Yeah . <vocalsound> Cool . S underwater uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah submarine . <vocalsound> yeah . Personally I think it's really ugly . <vocalsound> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Just give me the thing that it's inside there <gap> Yeah . maybe I'm too old for this stuff . Very cheap uh cheap look . Yeah but this this the <gap> is for the <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Okay . So those I think are all my <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> <gap> . oh . Ah yeah bright colours . Yeah . Also a kind of rubber uh <disfmarker> And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . Yeah . That's singly curved . Yeah . Yeah ? Okay . That should be nice . Well we could make a compromise between that . But I don't know if it's worth the effort . A compromise between what ? Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . So s This , this would be uh single curved uh ? Mm-hmm . Yeah there's only in in this dimension . Yeah . Like this . So curvy or not <gap> . Yeah . Also . Yeah . <vocalsound> Exactly . Exactly . Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? Yeah that would be an option . I don't know what you think . Yeah . I think the <disfmarker> I mean our aim is to make something different right ? To make something new . Yeah . Mm-hmm . I would go for the double curved . Okay . And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . Yeah I'd agree . Mm-hmm . So it kind of holds nicely , something like that . Yeah Yeah . but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . Well this is really your decision but <disfmarker> If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . Yeah . As well . You can make a trigger button or something like that . Yeah . Something to shoot at your television <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , Mm-hmm . Yeah . that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . That's <disfmarker> yeah . Mm-hmm . That would be a nice way to use it but <disfmarker> I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that <gap> that you can able to use in one hand I think . Different . Stands out . Or <disfmarker> Oh yeah a one hand uh solution . Yeah . So from top view it looks kinda like this . But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have <disfmarker> <gap> can turn it maybe . To switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little . <gap> . Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . <gap> . A little upwards . So that the screen is more Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it . towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . How about <disfmarker> Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here . Mm-hmm . Oh . Something like that . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but <disfmarker> Yeah I understand what you mean . That's uh that's <disfmarker> How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . If you can uh flip . So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or <disfmarker> And then if you want <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh so you have a the the side view . Yeah . Something like that . But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . But I dunno if that's too expensive . So and you want to be able to I mean maybe it's too much <disfmarker> Yeah . make this No uh like <disfmarker> <gap> . I would draw it like this . Let's say this is the side view . That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . If you know what I mean . Okay . Yeah . So that it would come up like that . Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . Yeah or <vocalsound> preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . Yeah . Oh the advanced buttons . Right . Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea . That's <disfmarker> Yeah . the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu . Yeah . Yeah . But you you want <disfmarker> F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? okay . You just want to hide them all ? Yeah . So w w The <disfmarker> oh . Yeah . No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . But you can hide the okay and the back uh button . Yeah yeah yeah . And the menu button also because when you flip it open <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . Oh <disfmarker> Activate and th the <disfmarker> yeah . <vocalsound> So <disfmarker> okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . Why ? You could just make it mechanical . True . True . But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . You know a simple uh <disfmarker> with a <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your <disfmarker> That's <disfmarker> but it's it's not Yeah . Exactly . it's not very uh very strong uh <disfmarker> yeah if you drop it one time <gap> . True . It uh c it can go open . Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . If you cover it with rubber . An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that . Okay . Mm . And <disfmarker> Exactly . Exactly . Yeah . So it can bounce . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . Yeah , uh <disfmarker> It's very no it's very strong . Th it's very solid yeah . Yeah okay so that that may work . Yeah . That actually will offer some extra protection for the <disfmarker> Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , What kind of <disfmarker> it this is your th Harder . Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there . <gap> . Okay . If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . With your uh wrist . <vocalsound> That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . Yeah . Uh yeah . Yeah of course . Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . Maybe can design two versions . Yeah . But that's that's very expensive uh <disfmarker> Like like you drew here . Yeah . And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . Give it <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . And ergonomical shape . Yeah . I would give it a female shape but uh yeah . Anyway . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> The female shape yeah . With two uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Obviously . <vocalsound> Make it more appealing to guys . Yeah . We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh <disfmarker> I mean <disfmarker> Oh yeah . Some uh k esk uh <disfmarker> yeah . and so if you <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess . I mean , we have to make <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is <disfmarker> so it has to have some sort of basic shape . Some <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah we we better so choose one <disfmarker> Yeah yeah . And also the screen , you cannot mould it . You know kind of thing . No no no no . <vocalsound> Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . Okay . Yeah . But that's the kind of the idea , so it lays good in the hand , <vocalsound> And then you can <disfmarker> and then on on the side with with your thumb , You can place the screen here , which can come <gap> . you you can you can use , yeah , you can use the button option <disfmarker> Yeah . So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? And <disfmarker> but then I w I would <disfmarker> Spongey . I would do the arrows here , kind of thing . Spongey can be reached by means of <disfmarker> Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , <gap> . so that <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ? I Uh y eah that's what I mean . No the arrow's over here . The arrows over here , Yeah . Yeah Yeah . and here the s simple uh <disfmarker> and then numbers . Buttons . Okay . Yeah . Alright . I think that uh it's a nice design . Uh pretty nice design . Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's cool . <vocalsound> Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . Yeah . <gap> or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> . I dunno . Yeah that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh bananas <gap> wierd shape and other fruits also , so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . Yeah . Yeah I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? we could make <disfmarker> Like some soft <vocalsound> green or something ? Orange or something . Or <disfmarker> and then <disfmarker> Or blue ? Dark blue or <disfmarker> Oh yeah yeah , dark blue and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , <vocalsound> an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , We should use <disfmarker> Yeah . with very uh bright tones I guess . Mm . Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . So you have something like <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . Yeah . Yeah okay yeah . If you we uh <disfmarker> yeah . If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , <vocalsound> also for the for the more uh yeah for the <gap> people . Mm . <vocalsound> Huh cool . <vocalsound> That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess . No it's <disfmarker> <gap> . Oh . What's this ? Yeah it's text . <vocalsound> Right . N no you have to exit . <vocalsound> Hm . <vocalsound> You could also make line with uh <disfmarker> So that's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah . Two hours further . Yeah . <vocalsound> <gap> thickness . Oh . So that's blue . Oh . Wh why not go for the twenty ? <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah . Yeah . That's what I call painting . Mm . Y <vocalsound> So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . Yeah . Yeah and then on top of that . It's pretty nice . And then uh <disfmarker> Oh <disfmarker> Some yellow . Yeah with some some yellow banana <disfmarker> Banana colour . Like <disfmarker> <vocalsound> . <vocalsound> And how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> the you know that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . Yeah ? So it <disfmarker> not not only in in the colours <vocalsound> of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or <disfmarker> How do you mean ? Um <disfmarker> Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . Some some <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Exactly . Well I think it's a bit too much but <disfmarker> Maybe a <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah an orange . Well alright well this is more like purple I guess , Yeah . but <disfmarker> it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So uh yeah . That would be a nice uh nice device I guess . And which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? Uh <disfmarker> Or <disfmarker> Who ? I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? Yeah . Yeah . Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six <vocalsound> five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . And then you can use yellow or semething . Why not ? <vocalsound> Aye . So just just a <vocalsound> a blue blue backlight or something like that . Yeah . Mm . Yeah . Green is too old-fashioned . But blue , blue's okay . J As long as you loo <vocalsound> use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . Yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? So that people with uh with Like this . White backlight , and dark . Dark uh letters , yeah . Yeah . Whatever which is visible . Yeah . <vocalsound> I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno . Yeah . And also for people who are a bit colourblind . Colourblind yeah . Yeah . True . No so that's mostly red and green I believe . Which which uh colour should the buttons be ? That's adjustable . Woah . Why adjustable ? All all buttons ? Yeah ? Or not . Okay . No uh <disfmarker> That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . Or is it uh too expensive ? <vocalsound> But <vocalsound> maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? <vocalsound> It's difficult . And if the background is very dark blue <disfmarker> Blue . Maybe green . But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? Yeah you can <disfmarker> Like the pictures I showed you guys . Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . Yeah ? Mm-hmm flashy . So more like <disfmarker> Mm bzz . Doesn't work very well . Uh . More like this colour . Yeah something like that , something that stands out more . And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . Mm . Yeah . But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or <disfmarker> Red maybe . And it it looks quite cheap , that colour I think . Uh <disfmarker> Black . It's it's not <disfmarker> The green ? Yeah . I dunno . Yeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side . Why ? Yeah . So <disfmarker> It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . It's it's trendy okay . Yeah . But <disfmarker> My couch is in that colour . Mm . Ooh . <gap> . <vocalsound> Yeah . Well it works pretty well . Yeah . <vocalsound> And then time was up . Uh not yet . Uh <disfmarker> <gap> . Do you get a pop-up if we <disfmarker> Yeah within five minutes yeah . <vocalsound> That you have five minutes left or <disfmarker> Alright . Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out . So something like this . Yeah . That should be pretty nice colour . But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . Yeah yeah . No Because the <gap> of the green . that's actu But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? Yeah . They have LEDs but they have a colour . <vocalsound> Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . Yeah ? They will see one of each as grey . Yeah . But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . I think . So red buttons are okay ? I think so . Okay . That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons . You can make them red . Yeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light . <vocalsound> How do you mean ? Yeah . Uh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think . Okay . Yeah I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and <disfmarker> 'Cause you have to print on them <disfmarker> you have a background No that's that's too busy I guess . Yeah . Each number is transparent . Yeah . Uh partly but you have to print on the number . Or the the sign . Okay . So you can't <gap> change the colour so <disfmarker> You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . Okay . Yeah . So just an extra Bit of light . You can <disfmarker> bit of light and attention . what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . Bit of feedback . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So that the whole button will shine Mm-hmm . as the colour the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> <vocalsound> And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , <vocalsound> but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Okay with <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> Don't mean to discourage you but <disfmarker> uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . Next thirty minutes to design something so <disfmarker> Ah , right . Alright . And the <disfmarker> You will do the evaluation . Of the product ? Yeah . Which we don't have yet . Yeah uh about <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> So wh how should I do that ? Yeah I don't know . Oh okay . <vocalsound> You probably get a mail . Or you you or you send it to me . Or just <disfmarker> because you are going to design it on this board right ? Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah . Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation <disfmarker> you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , I don't know . Yeah . so I make another presentation I guess . Yeah . I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so <disfmarker> About . Yeah . You have the basic idea . I've a basic idea . And you two uh are going to do this . Yeah . So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? Look-and-feel and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Good luck . Alright . Thanks . Yeah . Alright so that's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So I <gap> uh make new page and uh be creative . Yeah . Alright . But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? Yeah you have uh Thirty minutes . thirty minutes . Okay . Then we have to uh see something which we can uh Yeah . Yeah . Alright . Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? show to the management . Yeah . Shall we uh make a new uh <disfmarker> I would yeah . Yeah Yeah . l let's just uh delete all these uh <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> Yeah . Next . <gap> . Yeah , I just <vocalsound> make a new one . Oh , next <gap> . Yeah . Alright . Oh and save this uh board . Huh ? Just save it . Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there . Yeah okay but just press save and uh <disfmarker> Yeah . It'll be fine . On the left . S so , yeah . Uh sorry . <vocalsound> You can also include clip-art . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Current colour ? So if you'll rather draw in paint or something <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So um <disfmarker> Okay . Uh <disfmarker> Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? Yeah . Because <vocalsound> I I <disfmarker> And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . <gap> then look . Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . This ? Yeah . Yeah . So how it's gonna look . And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . Uh pretty accurate . So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . Oh we skip this I guess . Sound <gap> button press . Yep . Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches . Yeah . You can also include it . It's not much work . Light only button user ca user interaction . Oh no it's it's okay . <gap> so we kind of want the girlish <vocalsound> Yeah . That's included . Yeah okay . Yeah . So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . So <disfmarker> figure . I'm not so good at drawing . Excuse me ? Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on <gap> when when they are usable . Yeah . Yeah . No uh uh . Maybe you should draw it very large <vocalsound> like this . Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly . Yeah . Sensitive . Oh right . How do we uh uh Erase ? or insert text ? I dunno . Maybe just start typing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's a bit uh large . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh that's a bit big . Yeah . <vocalsound> You also do the other sides . Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . Yeah . Ex exactly . <gap> . L let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your <disfmarker> Jesus . What do I write down ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . <vocalsound> Much easier , yeah . Yeah . 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and <disfmarker> Yeah . The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . Mm . I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . No so I just work here a few minutes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah the display , Uh don't you think ? we yeah we can put a display . So the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable . Yeah . The <disfmarker> The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah . The th Exactly . Oh . This is hard . <vocalsound> What do <disfmarker> <gap> don't have to draw it exactly do we ? No it's it's uh it's okay . Wait . Let me try it one more time . Maybe I've uh <disfmarker> it's easier if I draw it in once . Okay , of course it will become way more ugly . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> You can make it m larger . <vocalsound> Maybe it's easier to to draw uh <disfmarker> Yeah . This'll take forever . It's fun to work with this pen . <vocalsound> Um so , larger . Oh . Yeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah . <vocalsound> Wrong one . And <disfmarker> yeah . So side . Five minutes left before the meeting ends . 'Kay . Um other views ? <vocalsound> Alright . Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . That's the question . <vocalsound> Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . But we we <disfmarker> Yeah . So this is gonna be from the I is it <disfmarker> if if this is from the side <disfmarker> uh from <vocalsound> woah . Steady . From the <disfmarker> yeah yeah . Sorry . Because there the screen goes up like that right ? Yeah . So then it's like this , or <disfmarker> that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the <disfmarker> Yeah ? it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ? Yeah I'm I'm <disfmarker> The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble . Okay . Because it do doesn't have to flip then . Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D . Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Because here <disfmarker> It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . True . But why why do we need uh the flipping uh <disfmarker> <gap> you can adjust the angle to which it flips . So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . Okay . Yeah . You can flip it up to there if you want . Yeah . So w yeah . But we still keep the flipping mechanism . Think so . Yeah . Yeah we keep the flip ? Keep the flip live . Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . I dunno . <vocalsound> Uh the the shape is okay but <disfmarker> yeah ? I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . <vocalsound> I thought it would be cool . <vocalsound> Yeah . Because we <disfmarker> Okay yeah . It's it's for for for more trendy uh <disfmarker> Yeah but maybe <disfmarker> Yeah but maybe we we should then <disfmarker> Because we have enough space . H here we got uh the basic functions , Yeah there the middle <disfmarker> the the arrow uh yeah button . Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? Yeah and then h we sh mm . And then like i oh th <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> doh . Come on . So this is the shape . Oh . It hasn't <disfmarker> <gap> . It doesn't aim so well . <vocalsound> Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . Yeah , then it's <disfmarker> So there's a layer of rubber on the side . Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely . <vocalsound> So no flipping but just <disfmarker> No flipping or <disfmarker> No flipping ? no . <gap> you wanted the flipping so <disfmarker> Yeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right ? But if you if you <disfmarker> If you drop it it it just breaks . And it has to be very strong because of the <gap> . Yeah kind of <disfmarker> Throwing and the kinetics . It's shaking . Yeah . Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually . Yeah true true . Yeah . Yeah just light on top . Yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics <disfmarker> And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . Yeah . Safer . Mm . Yeah okay that <gap> the target group . Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes . But there are more <disfmarker> Yeah okay . That's true . Okay . Yeah ? Well . I just uh ended the meeting . Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . You two go design . Okay wi Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . Oh . By the way . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah . <vocalsound> I uh thought up a name for our product . Yeah ? Oh right . Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote . <vocalsound> Ooh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> With a copyright sign after Real . <vocalsound> Alright . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> The Real Remote . Yeah . I like it . Okay . This can go . So maybe you can include that somewhere . Good . Yeah . We should work in our own room right ? Or not ? Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well . I don't see any power cables here so <disfmarker> Let's see . Yeah . Yes . What the hell's that ? <vocalsound> I think uh it's the sensors . 'Kay . See you two in half an hour uh <disfmarker> Okay . Uh <disfmarker> Good luck . <vocalsound> Yep . Okay that's the side . Ah it's it's okay . But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? Yeah . I think we do . Or just leave it ? Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button . <vocalsound> Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . For menu . Or <disfmarker> Yeah ? I dunno . We w kind of wanted to stick with the <disfmarker> Yeah . No , yeah . Yeah I'm just thinking , <vocalsound> if we i we wanna make something different <vocalsound> right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . Yeah . I think . Mm . Yeah you are going to design it so <disfmarker> <vocalsound>
Good morning , Flores . G good morning . Marketing Expert . Oh yeah . Right . Are you ready ? You should put the laptop uh right into the square . <vocalsound> For the cameras For i for the cameras , yes . Alright . Good morning , Sebastian . Good morning , <vocalsound> Mister P_M_ . <vocalsound> <gap> <disfmarker> I'm fine . <vocalsound> How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . <vocalsound> Geez . So <disfmarker> Do you want to open it as read-only . <vocalsound> Um I guess I should close it here . You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um <gap> sen oh stand-by . <vocalsound> Okay . Close the the window . Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . So <disfmarker> That's right . Ruud . Um project kick-off . Is there a schedule for this meeting ? Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting . Good morning , Ruud . Good morning . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Uh it's important um <disfmarker> I shall close the door . yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Um we're here to develop uh a new product . Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . Mm-hmm . Um <vocalsound> and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ? That's correct . Mm-hmm . Okay . Um <vocalsound> we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind . Alright . Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ? There is ? Yeah , there is . Okay . <vocalsound> No problem . <vocalsound> Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . <vocalsound> Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . Okay . The market , we should have a look at the market . Um <vocalsound> we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages . Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the <gap> <disfmarker> the the progressions , yes . Progressions . <vocalsound> Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific <disfmarker> uh specification of that . Um <vocalsound> the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think . It's for the vision . Yeah . Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it <disfmarker> keep it with the functional design . <vocalsound> Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . <vocalsound> Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um <vocalsound> to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . <vocalsound> Um yeah , I will show that now . Um you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh Sensors . sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um well , it <disfmarker> it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button . Okay , so not too fast writing . Um <vocalsound> you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . <vocalsound> Um you can use the eraser to make something go away . But we all use the same white-board file Yes . So we can work together on it while we're <disfmarker> or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? Yeah . Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . Yeah , okay . It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . Yeah , alright . Yep . Um you can choose the format , um <disfmarker> sorry . Uh <disfmarker> Let me see . Um <disfmarker> Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected . Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um <vocalsound> to um <disfmarker> oh well , I'm <disfmarker> I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training <vocalsound> um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected . Okay . <vocalsound> Um green . <vocalsound> An animal . Okay . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh a wee rabbit . It's a bunny . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A rabbit . <vocalsound> Alright . Okay , well great . Um Roo , could you do the same please ? <vocalsound> But of course , Flores . But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . Blank . Sebastian is thinking about the animal . I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal . <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah , I'm think about it too . <vocalsound> Format <gap> . Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but <vocalsound> it works , <vocalsound> Well , I'll give it a try . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . right ? It it should be a cat . Okay ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . <vocalsound> I'm guessing a horse . <vocalsound> Very good . <vocalsound> With a very small <vocalsound> legs . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I was very good in drawing . <vocalsound> You should feed that uh that animal . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , I guess you uh get the idea . <vocalsound> Yes , okay . Beautiful . <vocalsound> Beautiful . <vocalsound> Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions <disfmarker> well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um <vocalsound> the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , <vocalsound> um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh Limitations . influations influences . Okay . Okay . Okay ? Okay , great . <vocalsound> Okay . Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . <vocalsound> Uh I also will propose some uh um uh some implementations for that , but <disfmarker> well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . Okay . I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device <disfmarker> diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment . And for a cell phone ? Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . Yeah , okay . Yeah . I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh <vocalsound> is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth . But <disfmarker> Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . Mm-hmm . But it's cost-effective . But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so Yes . Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all . y you you can <disfmarker> So that's the point . Most of them . So <disfmarker> Or you shou sh use a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss Yeah . and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , Yeah . but take these things into account when you start the discussion . Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability , Yes , so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , and <disfmarker> Okay , and and uh <disfmarker> and the way of communicating with these equipments . Okay . Okay , good . Okay . Um <vocalsound> that was your presentation ? That's it . Okay , okay . Um <vocalsound> okay . Great . Um <vocalsound> I'll go back to my own presentation . Um <disfmarker> Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . <vocalsound> Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um <vocalsound> how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Mm-hmm . Um so let's start with you . H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ? Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um <disfmarker> Yeah uh , what is it , devices ? Yep . <vocalsound> Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . Yes , I think it should be something like that . It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , right ? Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , not <disfmarker> we're we're <disfmarker> it's not a <disfmarker> Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh <disfmarker> We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? don't have the information for it . No . No . No , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , No , okay . so it should fit to every device . Yeah . Yeah . Uh Ruud , y do you agree ? Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah . Okay . Okay . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> Well , the techni fu technical function uh <gap> <disfmarker> what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function . Yeah . So that was my <disfmarker> really my part for uh this session . Um <disfmarker> So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well , that's just the fu the technical function is <vocalsound> pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . Mm-hmm . It just should change the T_V_'s state . Okay . So that's it . Um but furthermore <disfmarker> And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? Yeah . Yeah , with buttons . Or are there any o other controls ? Are there only <disfmarker> any other cont Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or <disfmarker> Well , <vocalsound> But <disfmarker> I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . Yeah . Uh-huh . You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch <disfmarker> They're very vu vulnerable . w yes , Yeah . to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea , I don't know . Yeah . And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , Mm-hmm . so you must <vocalsound> point everywhere , so maybe infrared is <disfmarker> Okay . Maybe not even pointed . Yeah , just don't even point it , Yeah . so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that . Mm-hmm . Okay Uh is that uh <disfmarker> <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited . Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or <disfmarker> yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think the range should be a problem to that , Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in <disfmarker> outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Okay . Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting But <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah . um <disfmarker> Two more things . okay . Um You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . Okay , s yeah . Yeah . And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um <vocalsound> in dark too . So when it's dark <disfmarker> Okay . Those are two really uh user interface <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> <disfmarker> That's perfect . <vocalsound> Is tha <vocalsound> Okay . Okay . Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . Do do you <disfmarker> Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the <disfmarker> such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ? Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices . Mm-hmm . And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue . Because ? Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . Mm-hmm . But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So <disfmarker> we'll probably have to implement that . Okay . Okay . Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , but I've seem to forget them <disfmarker> <vocalsound> forgot them . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark . Um Yeah . uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ? Which makes it easier to operate it . Yeah . Well , maybe I um <disfmarker> but it it can be quite simple , I I don't know . you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . Mm-hmm . Okay . The uh the the digits in black . Mm-hmm . Uh then it's already visible in dark . Okay . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy <vocalsound> <disfmarker> well , it can be for design , of course . Okay . Okay . Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . So <disfmarker> Well , that's more <disfmarker> Yeah , Yeah . twelve Euro fifty , yeah . So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . The cost price is very low . Okay . Um <disfmarker> Just remind something . The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . Okay , okay . Okay . Very good point . Yeah . You have a m uh <disfmarker> Always have s the soft buttons , always uh clear the the the paint on it . The marks . Okay . Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily Mm-hmm . Okay . um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> So um maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or <disfmarker> But um <disfmarker> Necessary , yeah . yeah . I dunno , it's uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> that's more Sebastian's uh um <disfmarker> Yeah . Hmm . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's use uh a lot of uh <disfmarker> Yeah , Well does it ? well <disfmarker> I know it from the cell phone . I'm not sure . Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's <disfmarker> it seems to work uh quite okay . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah . So uh technically it will be possible . But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . No , you cannot . Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . Does it <disfmarker> <vocalsound> It's over ? <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Um Okay . <vocalsound> so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so this was it . Okay . See you in thirty minutes . Great .
Good . Beep . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . What ? So well uh welcome everyone . Yeah . Um as you may have noticed I uh <vocalsound> <vocalsound> created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . Yeah . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . That's new one ? We didn't make any uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Uh , we should save that one . <vocalsound> Oh in <disfmarker> Then I'll move this one . Didn't we just do that ? Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project . Oh . Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . Oh , okay . Hmm hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And we have a evaluation left here . Okay . Agenda . Well not main documents this time . Hmm ? Oh uh yes . I have it open myself I guess . Um well the detailed design meeting <disfmarker> Huh ? We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , Oh , sorry . and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? <vocalsound> <gap> We could . <vocalsound> Aren't you ? Yes , you are . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Yep . Yep . Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , Oops . <vocalsound> how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two . Yeah . Okay . Get up stand up . <vocalsound> Well uh <gap> just <disfmarker> we made a prototype . 'Kay . We first start with the overall uh <disfmarker> This is about the total remote control . View . We made it green . Just example colour , so uh Yeah . there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . It's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue . Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh <disfmarker> Okay ? Any questions so far ? <vocalsound> Big microphone . <gap> yeah , just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . Yeah . Oh okay . That's the place where it's going to be , not the size . <gap> Uh well , Yeah . it's an idea in a <disfmarker> so . Oh y you <disfmarker> perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh <disfmarker> Do not forget it . Uh <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . Yeah , okay . Of course . Hmm . The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . Mm . Mm , th yeah . Small . Okay um <vocalsound> we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um <gap> <disfmarker> You push the scroll button Yeah , you push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a <disfmarker> <vocalsound> and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . Remote settings , et cetera . Yeah . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see <disfmarker> oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , Yeah , and and use the the the scroll thing as a <disfmarker> with your fingers . that's c Yeah . Indeed . Yes . Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh <disfmarker> which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh <disfmarker> Yes . In an apart uh <disfmarker> Yeah . So a separate button for for text , In a separate button , yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . okay . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah . A sign , yeah , just like <disfmarker> Okay , indeed . Yeah . Okay , we can uh modify that later . Forgot . <vocalsound> Okay . Would you like to make any comments about next uh <disfmarker> Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but <disfmarker> It's the button where you can switch channels . <gap> just when you are one and you go to two , you can <disfmarker> or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . Previous page , yeah , indeed . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , Oh my God . I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute . Uh battery indicator . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's quite large . <vocalsound> It's <vocalsound> it's a bit big . <vocalsound> And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext . Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh <disfmarker> uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh <disfmarker> when you uh <vocalsound> when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . Huh . 'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , so <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . Yeah . Well this about it , I think . Okay . Huh . Yeah . Thank you . I will put it back on the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> on the nice green . Looks good . <vocalsound> And I just missed when I was typing <disfmarker> The R_R_ stands for ? <gap> That's the logo of the <disfmarker> Logo , okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Full screen . I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course . <vocalsound> Shit . Yeah . <vocalsound> Alright . <vocalsound> Sorry . <vocalsound> 'Kay . <gap> Okay , the evaluation criteria , Oh full screen , yeah <vocalsound> <gap> . Huh . huh ? Evaluation . 'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we <gap> <disfmarker> requirements from the <disfmarker> of the users . My name , my job , okay . My name , my job . <vocalsound> The methods . <vocalsound> Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . Right . One means absolutely not true , seven <gap> <disfmarker> means true . Yeah . The three important things of refa <vocalsound> <gap> are uh from th of this year is <disfmarker> are , <vocalsound> Sorry , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> you used the PowerPoint <gap> <disfmarker> is the remote control fancy enough , Yeah . is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . And then evaluation itself . Uh . What ? <vocalsound> So . <vocalsound> Bling . Okay . Yeah . First question . Is the design fancy enough ? Well <disfmarker> Project Manager , what do you think ? Well it's <disfmarker> looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , <vocalsound> Yeah . But does it <disfmarker> huh ? Yeah . Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? <vocalsound> Now uh It uh <disfmarker> oh it's in the background . Oh . the single curved idea was uh <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , you ge um <disfmarker> Y you should make uh a sideways uh view . Yeah . The sideways view , uh that that that ma It will be , I guess . Oh , we can <disfmarker> Ho not that pen . <vocalsound> Not that pen . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> Oh <vocalsound> Well g <vocalsound> I would <vocalsound> <disfmarker> smart board . it might work one time , huh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Suppose so . <vocalsound> Uh can I draw here or uh <disfmarker> Think . Ooh . Ah . Oh my God , Yeah , yeah , you can . So it works . it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ? Yeah , that's the single curve indeed . Yeah . So if you v flip it like this . Yep . Okay . Here's <gap> yeah . That's not very <disfmarker> i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , Yeah . So so uh <disfmarker> you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays a bit o Yeah . Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe . No . With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think <disfmarker> Yeah . I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , Yeah . Yeah . so if you could <disfmarker> Okay , indeed . Yeah . Yeah . 'Cause otherwise I think i Okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? Yeah , we have to rate . Is it fancy enough ? Okay . True is one , false is seven . So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . I think it does . I think so . I think <disfmarker> I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . It's pretty fancy . <vocalsound> Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , <gap> you get th Yeah . it's only design . Mm-hmm . I think it does . Yeah . And the design . Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . Yeah . Yeah . I don't know whether older people will use it , but <disfmarker> Very new thing . Well <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Fancy <gap> the old people will . I would make it a two or something . <gap> A two ? Yeah . <gap> It's true , it's a one . <vocalsound> Very fancy . Huh ? Alright , it's a one . <vocalsound> Oh it's a one . <vocalsound> No , it's a two . <vocalsound> Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ? Yeah , Yeah . I n used <disfmarker> I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> But it's a one uh <disfmarker> Okay , no Maybe uh <disfmarker> it's two ? True is a one . Yeah . Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ? Well Well I'd say two on a scale <disfmarker> they think it's very true , but uh <disfmarker> It's very true , Yeah , I think two . because we designed it to be very fancy , <vocalsound> Yeah , so <disfmarker> but <disfmarker> It's very fancy , I think . We should perhaps <disfmarker> Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? No , okay well , No , okay , that's true . <vocalsound> so so it's fancy . That's fancy enough . That not . Yeah . Then ? Okay , one two . That doesn't matter that much , Okay . so make it a one . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ? I think it is , Enough . because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . Yeah m And uh uh the scroll is rubber , We have for the search function . It's from rubber . Yeah . <vocalsound> so s The scroller a bit <disfmarker> Eno enough to <gap> I think . I think it's it's a one yeah . <vocalsound> It's a one I think . <gap> True . Also huh uh-huh <disfmarker> the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people . <vocalsound> Yeah , because they're right on your screen . So you can use the b the the arrows . Huh . They're right on your screen , so I don't know where you'd search . With the ones <gap> Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons . Yeah . <vocalsound> Well , I think they are . The options are it <disfmarker> uh little bit harder , Yeah . but if you touch the options then it's uh <disfmarker> Take a harder look , yeah , sure . I think th it's It's easier than the regular uh remote control . easy t Yeah , Yeah , I think this is easy now . and you use these buttons the most , I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to huh ? Yeah . So <disfmarker> No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find . to handle . True . I would rate it a <disfmarker> Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what <disfmarker> which sign or icon means on uh every button . Oh . Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true . Yeah . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most <disfmarker> So which <disfmarker> But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text . So Yeah . which number are we going to fill in ? I would say yeah . I think it's uh it's a two , at least . Yeah . Yeah , A two , yeah ? you can make it a two . Two , three and <disfmarker> Yeah . It's not perfect , but <disfmarker> what do you think ? <vocalsound> I think it's a three . A three ? Okay , so And why is that ? we have two , two , three . I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You can touch it . You can touch it . Yeah . It said bo both the options . You you can touch options . Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? Yeah . Yeah . Okay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah . You can touch options and it's comes out . A two , okay , Yep . A two , a two . because we have to <disfmarker> <vocalsound> The uh the um <disfmarker> Below . It's the box below it , Uh the next question the next question . huh ? <vocalsound> Oh my God . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Otherwise we have two results in one question . <vocalsound> It's different . <vocalsound> Okay , next question . It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . For young people I think it's easy to use . <gap> Young means sixteen to forty years . Yeah , I was <disfmarker> uh <disfmarker> Yeah . And elderly from forty eight to their death . Yeah . I think it's <disfmarker> I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In the entire mankind . Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , Also if you're sixty years old <disfmarker> Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , huh ? li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . So it's t I think it's really easy to use . Yeah . You want these options to <disfmarker> Also As well for the for the older people ? Yeah , as well Uh sure . as your <disfmarker> if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand <disfmarker> Yeah , but uh <disfmarker> Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , No , right ? but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , So <disfmarker> And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? so it it it has to be <disfmarker> Yeah , okay , but so they could <disfmarker> Uh I think it is . If they read a manual . Because that might <disfmarker> <vocalsound> If you read the manual , Perhaps that is one of the most uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , alright . <vocalsound> <gap> always . M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use . Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . Uh because a lot of <vocalsound> <disfmarker> You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , Channel one , channel four , yeah . then you say the question and the answer . <vocalsound> And that's everything it does , the speech recognition . Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . Yeah . I think it would make it uh <disfmarker> Yeah , I think it does . So <disfmarker> Because all the people who can't uh <disfmarker> I would make it two . Also two ? Yeah . Uh a two . Sure , two . Not a seven for this <gap> ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Three ? Oh . I'd say three . I would also say three . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . Okay , so You ? we have three three two two or <disfmarker> Two . Oh . Well <disfmarker> So what are we going to do ? <vocalsound> Two and a half . <vocalsound> Okay , a three , I see . Uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Give me more . Three ? No . <vocalsound> Another question . Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . No . No . No . No , that that's that's <disfmarker> But um I mean , yeah . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . that's definitely one . That's definitely our uh <disfmarker> Oh nee , oh seven is it ? It is . No ? Oh yeah . Yeah , uh the remote score . A false , yeah . Yeah . Yeah , but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , It's not overwhelmed . Yeah . so <disfmarker> Yeah , indeed . True . Okay , Yep . a one , because we designed for that , Remote control has uh colours that different <disfmarker> that meet different target groups . huh ? Yes . <vocalsound> <gap> 'Cause we make them in different colours , so that they uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah , Yeah . is optional . That's true . Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . Huh . can't you ? Also with rubber ? Uh I think you can . Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood Yeah , okay . but <disfmarker> It it feels like rubber , You can make a print on rubber , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> can't you ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah ? Well So that's a one then , but then when you scratch it it does come off . huh ? <vocalsound> That's a one ? Okay . Yeah , it is it is harder to So that's a bit <disfmarker> Do you have many questions ? Uh I have <disfmarker> to like <disfmarker> Oh , okay well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh we have time . <vocalsound> Geez . Yeah , but we have <disfmarker> We also <disfmarker> We have to get to the money . <vocalsound> We're getting paid . We're getting paid . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> The material used is spongy , <vocalsound> What ? that that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber . What <gap> spongy . Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . Uh . Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing . Oh but not <disfmarker> it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . I think it's a three . Yeah , it's a three , Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah . because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , Hard but <disfmarker> Yeah . because it has a L_C_D_ screen . <vocalsound> You can <vocalsound> break it . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Remote control is hard to lose . Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find . Y yeah , you could you could call it . Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh <disfmarker> set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose . It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally . Two . That it's hard to lose ? No . Yeah , it it is <disfmarker> there's the <disfmarker> Isn't hard to lose . Yeah , it's a six , you think ? <vocalsound> so isn't hard to lose you . <vocalsound> Isn't hard to lose , yeah . <vocalsound> Isn't hard to lose . So it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't <gap> <disfmarker> Yeah . You can't lose it . you can make it a three I <gap> <disfmarker> It does have an <disfmarker> a built in function . Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands <disfmarker> Yeah , but a har A hard to lose is good . So it should <disfmarker> this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . Nee . Hard to lose . Oh right . Yeah , this this is hard to lose . It is hard to lose . Yeah , <vocalsound> so then this is <disfmarker> it is almost true , This <vocalsound> <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> yeah , I think also . A two . so a two . A two . Two , yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> <vocalsound> And most all because of the option to <disfmarker> Huh ? Whoa . Ooh . <vocalsound> Yeah , it's okay . That happens above also . Oh . Uh . But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , Yeah ? Oh , okay . but <disfmarker> Yep . No . Oh , Oh well , it isn't , it doesn't . well okay . <vocalsound> <gap> put the cor cursor <gap> on the <gap> . Remember . <vocalsound> Okay okay okay . Remote control mainly be sold to younger people . Click . True . I think it will , Yeah ? True . <vocalsound> yeah . True ? Very true ? Uh yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Uh well No , I don't think very true because the colours . There . I <disfmarker> a a two . <vocalsound> We have the colours . Um we have the buttons is <disfmarker> aren't that that much . Materials , yeah . Nah , the material isn't that <disfmarker> It's it's much more younger . Uh okay . So I don I think So ma uh make it make it a two . I think it's a three . Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , Yeah . Yeah , I think it's a two but I uh <disfmarker> didn't we ? but <disfmarker> Okay , okay . What do you think ? I think because <disfmarker> Questions ? A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too too . Two . Uh-huh . <vocalsound> yeah ? Two two two . <vocalsound> Let's make everything a two . In the features ? Dissatisfy younger people . Um <disfmarker> Younger people . It has <disfmarker> Well perhaps not . What did <disfmarker> Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . Yeah . Well Well , that <disfmarker> it doesn't . n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , <vocalsound> Yeah bu but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> but it's for a remote control I think it i <vocalsound> it would satisfy those needs . I think they like the speech . Yeah , the speech possibility , You could call to your uh <disfmarker> L_C_D_ screen and scroll . yeah , and the screen , the colours . Scroll options , yeah . yeah . I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations . Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something . Right , No . that that that <disfmarker> It has relatively few features , those are features . It's three features , basically , with <disfmarker> the L_C_D_ <gap> touch screen is feature . Yeah . The microphone is a feature . No , aren't the features <disfmarker> the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , Yeah . and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah . Yeah , okay . Ours had other features with <disfmarker> I think <disfmarker> yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . The easy volume up button . Those are features . Remote <disfmarker> younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . <vocalsound> Turn uh turn up the volume . <vocalsound> Yeah yeah . <vocalsound> Enough features ? So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one . Personally , yeah . I think once you've <disfmarker> 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the <disfmarker> you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . Yeah . Okay , you think one , what do you think ? I think two or three . You . <gap> three , yeah . Two . I'd say three , so two it is then Yeah . Yeah uh Make it make it a two . a two a two . <vocalsound> Just another two . <vocalsound> or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> One two three . <vocalsound> Or make it uh a fucking two . We like two . <vocalsound> Right . You can see the remote control is <gap> R_ and R_ . Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . Uh . Yeah . Yep . <gap> Has <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . oh yeah , do did have <disfmarker> nah y you have the black one . Yeah . And we'll probably make also a yellow one . Yeah , Yeah . but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . Yeah , maybe maybe two . Well m th Maybe two . but the logo is on on the front , Okay , true , yeah . so <disfmarker> a two , yeah , One d on i it's the colours and the <disfmarker> X_ marks spot . <vocalsound> that's <disfmarker> And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . <vocalsound> I think it is , but I don't know what you think . <vocalsound> I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , Yeah , tha that's so true . because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . Mm-hmm . Yeah , uh <disfmarker> And you can navigate easier , Yeah , you can navigate . Uh . because wi with the <disfmarker> you have to push the the the arrows and <disfmarker> with a normal T_V_ uh remote . I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . You're not satisfied , okay . No , I'm not not convinc . <vocalsound> Let's start over again then . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Let's make a different remote . Well <disfmarker> Let's go th for <vocalsound> <transformerror> <transformerror> <transformerror> <vocalsound> Menu . I think it would be a t yeah , two . <vocalsound> A two ? <vocalsound> Now lower . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> A two . Oh , well We only have twos . <vocalsound> that's that's pretty good , huh ? Oh yeah , I think so . Yeah . Uh just twos . One three and a few ones . So okay , And three . we have one three , a one , that that have to got up . <gap> Two threes . Two two two two two . We m mostly have twos , So two , yeah . The average is a two . so it's pretty good . Yeah . That is quite good The average . <vocalsound> Yeah . I think so too . in my opinion . Yeah , I think so . That <gap> We can be happy . Ooh . Save . <vocalsound> <gap> Ooh . <vocalsound> Yeah . What is it ? It's like a bug or something . It's a fly . A fly , yeah . Oh m A f butterfly . Top . Yeah . That's it . Okay . That was your evaluation uh show , Yes . okay , so <vocalsound> Sure . we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . No , it's two . The average is two . Okay , good . It's good . Yeah . Um let's see <disfmarker> oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already <gap> Yeah . Exactly . Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it . And this <gap> Everything okay . Well , the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that . Yeah . <vocalsound> Redesign . No . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . <gap> <vocalsound> <gap> look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , Yeah . and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty , we're good , Yeah . and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , So we're going to erase features or something . but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if I Do you have the cost or uh <disfmarker> put the Excel sheet in the <vocalsound> Let's hope . n not in the <vocalsound> <gap> f fifty five Euros . <vocalsound> We're going to be here at eight o'clock . <vocalsound> folder . I think it's I think it's still in my own documents folder . <vocalsound> We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . I doubt it . Oh shit . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet . Yeah mm yeah , maybe . So <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No , The microphone . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . it was in my uh my information , It i It wasn't too much . so uh <disfmarker> Yeah ? <gap> Yeah . maybe you're going scrap scrap it . As well as the L_C_D_ screen . Whoa . <vocalsound> Okay , well Well , if it doesn't work <disfmarker> this is it . Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , I want to fill it in , but uh <disfmarker> No prob . and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . Ah . But you should uh direct <disfmarker> Count it ? Li like write it be Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . Count it . But you have to fill in this column , huh ? You got Excel to count . <vocalsound> <gap> The number of <disfmarker> No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay <disfmarker> Oh okay . Well Ah , okay , cool . and there are different screen shots , so <disfmarker> or different different screens , I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , Huh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it . Um <disfmarker> because I draw the uh so <disfmarker> We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? Yeah . I would do a battery <disfmarker> we do . Solar cell . Right ? No it took a battery ? A battery . One battery , We'll wait . No , no solar cell , no no no no . right ? Yeah . No hand dynamo . Yeah . <vocalsound> Electronics , simple chip <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Hand <disfmarker> <vocalsound> We have <disfmarker> advanced chip , right ? No , we have sample speaker . On advanced chip . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do Yeah , yeah . Yeah , so this one and this one . Uh we ha we have um single <disfmarker> Oh , we already on nine . what ? Are we ? Oh yay . We have double curved . <vocalsound> The single . Single nee single curved . Single . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . But it isn't three dimensional , This one is <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Oh it isn't curved in a l the the <disfmarker> it's not going to work uh people . We have rubber . This one is curved like this , right . I'll just fill it in . It's curved like this . No no no , single curved is like this . Um rubber indeed ? Yeah , Uh that's the only curve you made , bu what <disfmarker> not th uh curved like that . That's uh <disfmarker> Oh , but we have curves like it and it . There are two curves , Thirteen ? right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . Huh ? With a scroll wheel , right ? Rubber . Yeah . Is he integrated ? No , eh ? I don't know . Push button . Yeah , No , we don't have push button . we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s Oh yeah , right , we want it to <disfmarker> it's not it's not <disfmarker> no . <vocalsound> L_C_D_ display . Not going to work ? Okay . Okay um <disfmarker> Yep . Fifteen , oh , too bad . <vocalsound> Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ? But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements . Oh , we don't have any buttons , so <disfmarker> Eighteen and a half , Yeah , damn . we need to uh We have to lower it with six points . Damn . No , Okay . uh we have fifteen and <disfmarker> Twelve and half . oh , right . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> We could lose the curve . Nah . We could use <disfmarker> Yeah , I would lose the curve . We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . But you can't push it , so you have to tap . Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh <vocalsound> with uh the button . Yeah , alright . Yeah , I think that will be our best bet . So normal scroll wheel ? Normal scroll wheel . And I think we should lose the curve . I think we should scrap the sample speaker . Lose <vocalsound> <disfmarker> It's four pri it four units . Yeah , but if you <disfmarker> would i it is a new feature , it it's something special . Okay , so we don't exactly need the single <disfmarker> We don't need a curve . But w d wha No , 'S possible to lose curve . the curve doesn't really <disfmarker> Curved then it will be square . No , then it will <disfmarker> won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> Was that <disfmarker> does that mean to it , single curve ? Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . Yeah . The curve is uh in a dimension . Okay . If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . So <disfmarker> We would lose this one ? Yeah , but tha that that only is one . Yeah , okay . Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit . No , two . No , one . Sixteen point three . Oh , okay , indeed . So we don't <disfmarker> So we still <disfmarker> Yeah , we also have to <disfmarker> Is it possible to make <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . No ? Ma y you just can't do that , or uh <disfmarker> No . And what did you change ? You changed the uh scroll wheel We changed th and <disfmarker> Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved . Single curved . Oh , Flat . but it's just one Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think <disfmarker> point , No . so maybe you should should uh <disfmarker> Scrap sample speaker ? Yeah , That that's uh <disfmarker> you should you should drop the speech recognition . The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . Yeah , but it's t Yes , four points . Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , And then you can keep the curve . it is something special . Or can't you ? Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the <disfmarker> Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? F You have to <disfmarker> we have to scrap four points . <vocalsound> I don't know . Yeah , that's difficult . <vocalsound> Yeah . Or make it on a hand dynamo , but <vocalsound> I don't think that will work . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? No , that's <disfmarker> no . Make it w uh Uh . when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? <vocalsound> We could make it titanium instead of rubber . <vocalsound> You don't make a remote control of <disfmarker> Ah . Yeah , it it i Yeah , mm-hmm . Yeah , it also <disfmarker> uh it also takes one point less . Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , Oh . Oh can I ask something ? What is special colour ? yes ? Yeah . Is that the wood uh wood uh <disfmarker> I think it is . this , we have to have that one too ? It isn't . What ? Yeah . Yeah , but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . Yeah . Sample speaker . To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor . Th then we still have too much Yeah , okay , if we use the uh <disfmarker> three . Point three . But m yeah , course , but <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , we we scrap that one ? What we'll have . <vocalsound> Huh ? Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . <vocalsound> Point twelve <gap> . See , a po three . <vocalsound> We need point three . <vocalsound> That's a scroll wheel . <vocalsound> Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood . A colour . Yeah , but a wood <disfmarker> Make it uh <disfmarker> we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it Yeah , a all kind of colours ? special colours , fruity colours . It's also green Is it also <disfmarker> or uh <disfmarker> no that that's just normal colour <disfmarker> fruit colours . Yeah . Normal colours , yellow <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . Yeah . You don't say here's green rubber . They don't sell green rubber plants . <vocalsound> Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . Alright . Yeah , you can , you should <disfmarker> you have to lose <disfmarker> But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess . No no no . s advanced chip . No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? Five ? If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen Then we have two . S A push , touch . yeah . <vocalsound> then it's possible to make . Then we can make <disfmarker> add two colours on it . And then you can <vocalsound> and then you can add to the colours . Yeah , two colours <gap> it . Special c Switch colours . Okay , if you lose uh <vocalsound> if you lose the <disfmarker> It was such a great idea . <vocalsound> You lose this one , you got eleven point five They can add two colours . and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add or <disfmarker> How d uh uh how many colours ? What do you mean ? Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p Yeah , but we we we are <disfmarker> we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . Ah okay . Oh . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , I suppose . 'cause you have to add it . Yeah . Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black . Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . Yeah b Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow <disfmarker> uh red , and then you add <disfmarker> you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . Nee we we also want to make ano another colour . Oh right , yeah . Yeah , Yeah , we should u but m Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . Yeah , because we have more colours than only black . That's what it means . Yeah , Yeah . but isn't it per remote that you pay ? I <disfmarker> then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special <disfmarker> Oh right , yeah . Half ? Is it per remote ? I think you pay half per remote . Yeah . Yeah , that's right , So each remote with a special colour . and you <disfmarker> one colour per remote . Yeah , indeed , yeah . So then it is one . You don't need four of those <vocalsound> uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . Yeah , okay okay , true . True , true . No . I hope . <vocalsound> We have two points spare . So the battery , Nee one point . we have um advanced chip on print . One . <vocalsound> So it would be curved , single curve . Because of <disfmarker> thing <disfmarker> Or not ? Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . Hmm . So Yeah , single curve . y you just can't make a nice remote . <vocalsound> Because that was very important , It's too bad for the speaker . huh ? So it's curved , it's still that <disfmarker> so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , Mm yep . or not ? We dropped the scroll wheel . Could you copy it ? And make it uh <disfmarker> And the rest is the same , huh ? Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . Am I right ? Yes . The entire uh <disfmarker> Uh . Huh . Yep . Perhaps you can then copy page or so . Ooh . No . Okay . Oh you you made the entire <disfmarker> could you <disfmarker> Undo , undo . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh Undo . not <disfmarker> Well <gap> . So , 'kay . Twenty minutes ? Would you ? By the <disfmarker> Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page . Select all . No , but you c yeah . Alright , something went wrong . Tap . Okay , but this this new remote we can afford . <vocalsound> It doesn't work . Let's forget . It should've work . Okay , so you had this list at start ? <vocalsound> Hmm ? Alright . No , I hadn't . When did you receive this list ? I just received it . Ah okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Oh ignore that . <vocalsound> They don't work so hard at the finance department . <vocalsound> Ah okay . <vocalsound> Well , so <disfmarker> I suppose this is a <disfmarker> Okay , so Too bad . we lose the scroll wheel , Yeah . the s The microphone . Yeah , and that's it . Yeah . And the microphone . A and we changed something , I guess , or not ? We <disfmarker> Oh no . Yep . Okay . Twelve Euro fifty . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work . It didn't work . So we could fix it like tha that it's like this . <vocalsound> Hmm . Strange . You could select it all , but then you can't erase . <vocalsound> Strange . Oh , you can arrange <disfmarker> You can only re erase ? Erase . Oh . When you saw th li uh <disfmarker> Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything . Uh , no . Hmm , can't you then just say copy ? Bling . New page . Paste . Yes . Ah . <vocalsound> Select none . <vocalsound> <gap> just tap somewhere . Just tap somewhere . <gap> just up somewhere b uh besides it , right . Okay , Yeah . and now you can erase . I don't think I can , but uh we can try . Uh , we already try . Well it should be possible . Oh , yeah , no , Oh no . ha-ha . Well No ? you can draw over it with white uh pen . <vocalsound> Yeah , we tried it earlier . Oh . It's very much work . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Sorry . <vocalsound> Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now Evaluation drops . which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh design . Doodle . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . And erase the mic . Yeah , goodbye mic . All I need is no mic . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Let's see , Oh , I already erased half of the line . we can save this now . <vocalsound> Bon chance <vocalsound> And move back to here . Too bad , oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Like this ? Mm-hmm . Still looks nice . And then all green . Okay , well thank you . Oh , Looks like a iPod . that's erase . Oh , no <gap> . No , Hey , add <gap> <disfmarker> but you can erase that . Yeah , that's a bit weird . Yeah . Uh-oh . Oh , S Difference between lines and text and the pen . now I'm <gap> line . Yeah . Oh . Right . <vocalsound> All I need is <gap> mic . <vocalsound> And you can't erase this ? <vocalsound> Hmm , strange . No , <vocalsound> it's weird . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save . Station page . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . Huh , looks fucking boring now . <vocalsound> We just did <gap> our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ? Deadlines were sometimes very short . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Bu but stressful . But <disfmarker> You think , no , my presentation isn't ready . And stressful . Yeah . I think we <disfmarker> it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . Yeah . Now we worked through each other , Yeah . And you could ask things . Yeah , something he said <disfmarker> you had information I didn't have yeah , and then uh <disfmarker> and you had information I also had , Oh right . <vocalsound> so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , Yeah . Yeah . so <disfmarker> Yeah . And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? <vocalsound> Yeah . And uh <disfmarker> So yeah , that <disfmarker> I don't think that is the best way to work at <disfmarker> for such project . Yeah . No . So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? Yeah . Yeah , you could <disfmarker> Why should we be separated from each other in those difference <disfmarker> uh different rooms ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Well , I think so too . probably to simulate the whole working uh process , Yeah . Yeah , but then you can work together too huh , th <gap> you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks . when <disfmarker> Yeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , Huh , oh right . but now we're completely separated from each other . No . A chat would also be uh <disfmarker> I don't think that was the best way , but <disfmarker> But the technology was uh fantastic . <gap> Yeah , the technology's okay . Well , I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think <vocalsound> . Work now ? Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because <disfmarker> Perhaps it is e It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase Yeah , or it doesn't uh <disfmarker> perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh <disfmarker> and lay it next to that keyboard over there . Yeah . Yeah . So you can draw uh <disfmarker> see it over th on the screen . Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , Yeah . Yeah . yeah . Yep yep yep yep yep . So But <disfmarker> you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful <vocalsound> It's useful , but not m or <disfmarker> Well Yeah , it is useful , but <disfmarker> it is useful , but it doesn't really work all the time . No . Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below . Th the pen doesn't <disfmarker> The line is a bit off . Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . Yep . Alright . Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be . But <disfmarker> The project uh <disfmarker> because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh <disfmarker> have , you didn't have time to uh <disfmarker> to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . Yeah . So you used uh this uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the <disfmarker> Oh . <vocalsound> That wasn't me . <vocalsound> Wasn't me . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh <vocalsound> so um the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ? I <disfmarker> I didn't use it at all . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I I used it , it it was <disfmarker> you can use it , it's quite handy I think . Yeah , well But I didn't <disfmarker> I uh <disfmarker> I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , Yeah , I used it to y to <disfmarker> huh ? Yeah , it did work pretty well . I used it too , but <disfmarker> oh well . I didn't use . Yeah . I don't think why you would want to use it actually , Yeah , No <disfmarker> because it shou yeah . but it it does work . <vocalsound> To make some designs , Yeah . It is it is <disfmarker> it is very easy . yeah , it is easy for <disfmarker> to design something and then load it in your computer . Yeah . Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody . Yeah . But to write it th yeah . Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to write . It doesn't really write normally . It's a bit <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah , it's too big , it's too fat . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Fat document , those . <vocalsound> Okay , um and what about the teamwork ? Team work was okay . I think it was great , Yeah . Yeah , well I think so too . yeah . Only thing that we worked through , past each other . <gap> we <disfmarker> Right . Yeah , With some things that was only problem , but that was <disfmarker> it was our assignment , Yeah , but <disfmarker> but it was because we didn't uh <disfmarker> huh ? Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah , but furthermore better . Okay , and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I thought it was good , but uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . yeah , no prob . Ah . Yeah well , <vocalsound> Yeah . okay . Not too much , not too too too too <gap> . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . And creativity ? Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , <vocalsound> <vocalsound> huh ? But <disfmarker> Well . Yeah , or the room for <disfmarker> it was the idea to be creative , There was room for <disfmarker> so <disfmarker> Yeah . You got some standard ideas in your head <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . and this what came out . And you get get stuff from the from the computer , Yeah . but <disfmarker> The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late Little bit uh lo yeah . Too late <disfmarker> or <disfmarker> Yeah . it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema You just sit there for ten minutes . Yeah . yeah . Yeah , <gap> where is that email ? I played I think seven times Solitaire something . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh You did ? Well , I didn't have time for that . did you ? Is it on there ? <vocalsound> Wha Is it on there ? I didn't find the <disfmarker> didn't look but uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> At some times I <disfmarker> Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment , Oh right , <vocalsound> Was searching and searching . it is there . I didn't look , but <disfmarker> No , I I never got that . and then <disfmarker> <gap> I got like one email after ten minutes or something . I always <disfmarker> <vocalsound> N yeah . I even got spam . <vocalsound> Or something like that . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> That's what we said . <vocalsound> So does this <disfmarker> I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , And it <disfmarker> not a lot uh <disfmarker> in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do . No , the first one . No , w I didn't know <disfmarker> Yeah , I didn't know uh <disfmarker> like I <disfmarker> with with the remote <gap> and I never new we have t we had to uh <disfmarker> yeah made a made a rec a remote control . Make a r yeah . nee . And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , Yeah , so <disfmarker> Yeah . so I went , right . <vocalsound> No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page . Yeah . <vocalsound> And I was working and working and work <vocalsound> Just looking at the screen and uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> No . Okay , well um So , yeah . <disfmarker> but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . Yeah . When we get uh <disfmarker> when we have <disfmarker> we would have gotten uh more information . Mm-hmm . Yeah , Yeah , more information about the costs . Faster . an Yeah . Yeah , that will be handy . First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh <disfmarker> first point , but uh it was possible <vocalsound> Yeah . uh <disfmarker> uh , yeah . Yeah , it only costs four units . Uh <vocalsound> yeah . Yea uh so Yeah . tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ? <vocalsound> Uh , I dunno . Um <disfmarker> Yeah . Think that's about it . Nothing . Hmm . I think we got it already . Heavier um <disfmarker> less heavy laptops . Yeah , Yeah . <vocalsound> Uh . Faster laptop . they're pretty heavy . <vocalsound> Yeah . Uh . They were they were just fine . But that's not really uh <disfmarker> And furthermore the the the network was okay . Yeah . Everything you loaded was also Uh . Yeah , everything worked . av available there . Right . And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , So <disfmarker> Yeah . is what you say . Yeah . Yeah , but that <disfmarker> Okay . It's now half past four <disfmarker> half past three , so <disfmarker> Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone . Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay . Then it pops up <disfmarker> pop up screen came . Mm-hm . Mm . Five minutes in the meeting . Yeah . Mm . No . <vocalsound> Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . Huh . Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes , You did ? so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , Well <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> yes , which is the closing . Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . I don't know if that's the best way to <disfmarker> when it isn't <disfmarker> is it <disfmarker> when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , Oh , right . but we had to do it , Well <disfmarker> huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . And we evaluated . Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results , <vocalsound> so uh Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . celebration , well , for the three of you , Champagne . <vocalsound> because uh I have to write the final report now . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . But uh <vocalsound> well , thank you very much for your co-operation , <vocalsound> and I had a very nice day so far . <vocalsound> Yeah , sure . No prob . Oh thank you . Mm-hmm . Okay . Do we get another email ? <vocalsound> Bling . <vocalsound> You're fired . <vocalsound> Um <disfmarker> I think you do . I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again , but <disfmarker> Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but um <disfmarker> well We do ? Mm . I at least . But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report . Yeah . Uh th that that one ? You cannot <disfmarker> you can save it . Yeah , maybe . You can just <disfmarker> <gap> wants to , but at least this one . Yeah , but it's <disfmarker> it isn't a picture or , well , is it ? I know , we should remove this , You s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG . but it won't h Okay . And uh please put it in the project folder then , huh . Can you find it as a J_ PEG ? No . <vocalsound> No , isn't possible . But you can make a screen shot , I think . <gap> Okay , well I uh <disfmarker> No . <gap> No . I hereby officially close the meeting Yeah . Okay . and uh I hope to see you uh soon . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> In about five minutes . Uh oh , <vocalsound> Well , export . I think we'll be a bit a bit longer , Ah . but <disfmarker> okay . Well , <gap> happy celebration , huh ? Oh thank you . Images . Whoo-hoo . <vocalsound> Celebra <vocalsound> Let's let's have party . <vocalsound> Or shouldn't I ? How big do you want the images ? Let's have some fun . <vocalsound> How big ? Uh Huh ? Yeah . <gap> not too big . <vocalsound> This one ? Six hundred . No , Whatever you think is good . I <disfmarker> yeah . No that uh is one thousand twenty four . <vocalsound> I think eight hundred six hundred is better . <vocalsound> This one ? Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> If it browse . Nah , name . <gap> Um <disfmarker> Desktop . <gap> Well it isn't on the desktop . Hey . Mm ? <gap> I do not know . You can only save it in my documents . <gap> Oh ? <vocalsound> Oh my God . Yeah . Oh . <vocalsound> Oh , alright . Yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . Three . <vocalsound> Ten . Can we stay here ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Ten . Yeah . Uh . Okay . Yeah , alright . Why can't we stay here ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <gap> Alright . Yeah . <vocalsound> Celebration time , come on . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Oh . <vocalsound> Peace out nigger . <vocalsound> Entree <gap> <vocalsound> <vocalsound>
<gap> . Hello <vocalsound> . 'Kay . You all saw the newsflash ? It's <disfmarker> Or you got the same message ? Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago . <vocalsound> Yeah sorry . I don't know . When I uh <disfmarker> I didn't see it yet I think . <vocalsound> Yeah . Newsflash ? D did I miss something ? Yeah . Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but <disfmarker> Yeah pretty much . Hey what's wrong with my computer ? Okay . Is it unlocked ? Mm . <gap> . No . Yeah that's my presentation . <vocalsound> Woah . I uh kind of opened it <gap> . Huh ? Mm . Mm ? What the <disfmarker> Oh right . Uh <disfmarker> I think you have to uh change your desktop uh <vocalsound> Okay . size . Ooh . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Everybody ready ? Not really . Well <disfmarker> Sorry . <gap> computer is uh not functioning ? No no no . Yes yes yes . Alright . Okay . Where do I find this ? <vocalsound> Okay . I'm not so g display huh ? Uh display . <vocalsound> And then uh settings ? Appearance ? Huh . Mm I'm not sure I <gap> . <vocalsound> You read the newsflash ? <vocalsound> No . 'Kay . Can we get started No what was it about ? Hmm . or is there some pressing issue ? Yeah my computer is not functioning properly . Oh no pressing . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? Yeah yeah . No but my screen is reduced in size . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . That's difficult . Yeah . What ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Feedback . Hmm . Okay . <vocalsound> Okay . <gap> alt delete . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Format . <vocalsound> Format save . <gap> . So it doesn't draw the attention away . This is dreadful . Yeah . I made uh uh my own map . No not this , but the task . Oh yeah sure . It's a <disfmarker> You have Playstation also ? <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> No that's okay . Yeah . No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . Ah . Uh <disfmarker> where was it ? In settings ? Okay . Alright . Thank you . Huh . Do you guys like your tasks ? Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . Yeah wa wa you actually <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . So frustrating . But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation . So <disfmarker> Yeah . I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . I have to do that so switch . Yeah <disfmarker> Yeah exactly . This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . Really annoying . Okay . So there we are again . By your humble P_M_ . Yeah . <vocalsound> Okay this is the agenda . Um we have three presentations , I heard . <vocalsound> Really . <vocalsound> Yeah really . <vocalsound> So who wants to start ? Yeah that's fine <gap> . Yeah . We have to start it right away ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Functional ? Yeah functional requirements . Uh this is you ? 'Kay . Alright . I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . Um <disfmarker> Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . <vocalsound> Users think they're ugly . Um <vocalsound> they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . Um <vocalsound> they are often lost somewhere in the room . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . And they're bad for R_S_I_ . <vocalsound> I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . Um <vocalsound> Ts there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . Um but they are used . I mean the <disfmarker> So they do need to be in the <disfmarker> Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . Yeah . I mean if you can't control the the sound settings <disfmarker> I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . Alright . So um yeah we have to . <vocalsound> <gap> often . By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but We c we c Yeah I mean w we can't <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Next generation does . <vocalsound> <disfmarker> okay . my my T_V_ has , No . <vocalsound> Alright . but we we can leave them uh away . Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . N not used anymore . So forget this one . Okay . Uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? Yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> I was wondering uh <disfmarker> I didn't get anything . Yeah , <vocalsound> on on the project uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Not by mail . I receiv the mail but you don't . So <disfmarker> No so it's a text file n in the project folder . But you you've got more information than <disfmarker> uh . So teletext can be skipped . That's in the presentation , so <disfmarker> Alright . Um there was some research on new features in a remote control . Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the the the targeted group . So it's above forty I guess . Uh below I believe . The new product ? Or below <vocalsound> Yeah below forty . because that's pretty relevant . Mm-hmm . I thought I read a <disfmarker> Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . Yeah ? And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . Below ? Okay well <vocalsound> But where did you get uh that information ? that's that's in the newsfla That's in a newsflash . okay that's a good to know . <vocalsound> Okay . <vocalsound> Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . Yeah . I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . So I think we can build that in . Um <disfmarker> Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting . Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . Um and and also there's <disfmarker> so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . Um <disfmarker> And I think <disfmarker> and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control <gap> in your room . It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . Yeah . So it's <vocalsound> the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh <disfmarker> Yeah . But it also needs to have corporate identity . Yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah , and the colours as well . Present and the colours . <vocalsound> So we can't change much of that . Do we have <disfmarker> Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . uh yeah <gap> . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much . Yeah . Okay . Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part . Alright . Yes . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Okay . It's open already so you can use <gap> to <gap> . Mm . find yours . It's <disfmarker> F_ five . F_ five . Okay . <vocalsound> Go Jurgen . Oh . What is this ? <vocalsound> Oh no . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> How do I uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> You pressed alt F_ four ? <vocalsound> No no no . I pressed the mouse button . Oh great . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> It's <disfmarker> th that's the self-destruct button . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . Okay . Yeah . Um if you all go stand around uh <disfmarker> Just <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . <vocalsound> Computer <disfmarker> Sure . Alright . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's nice . <vocalsound> No . F_ five . Yeah . Yeah . Okay . Alright . I uh had uh two examples . Mm-hmm . Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . Mm-hmm . This the easy one Yeah . I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? The mm yeah . Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . So we <disfmarker> Okay so so we have the option for more functions . So not not too much but <disfmarker> yeah . Um <disfmarker> yeah . And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech <disfmarker> And the speech recognition yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah . alright . Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah . But <disfmarker> Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option . Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . Okay one device . Yeah . So n it's very easy . Okay . I didn't see <gap> . So w Now yeah it's okay . <vocalsound> Okay and I also uh yeah . W yeah . So there are not extra options in this case , but uh <disfmarker> Okay . We have to make it fashionable . Like you uh said uh before . Yeah . Yeah . Uh yeah the basic functions . Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed . Yeah Yeah . so maybe you can hide them or something . Yeah . Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . Yeah you make a screen menu or something . And the and the <disfmarker> yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , Yeah . Yeah . and then the basic function just on the device itself . So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu . Mm-hmm . Yeah Yeah . and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . What does the screen do ? <vocalsound> Did I uh <disfmarker> Uh . <vocalsound> What are <disfmarker> wh Alright . Yeah . It's low power . did I break it ? <vocalsound> What <gap> . So what does the screen do ? They said they needed it but what does it do ? What do they want with the screen ? For for the advanced functions I think . Yeah that's what we make it up . Yeah well it <gap> yeah it didn't So but what did the marketing <disfmarker> it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . No . Well I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions . Yeah okay it's handy . With no predefined uh <disfmarker> Like searching for channels and <disfmarker> Yeah searching for channels , programming them . Ah look . We have your uh <disfmarker> Yeah . oh never mind . <vocalsound> We're back online . <vocalsound> Okay . That's uh <disfmarker> I'm al I'm almost finished so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Um the <disfmarker> Okay . <vocalsound> we have to to to watch out for the <disfmarker> i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable Mm-hmm . Content and form . yeah content and form . Yeah . <gap> . Yeah . <vocalsound> Now that that was uh was the end . <vocalsound> That was the end . Yeah . Okay . Yes . Okay . Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Well you can improvise right ? Uh which one is it ? Technical functions ? Yeah a little bit . Uh no . This one ? No no . <vocalsound> Functional requirements ? Yeah I think that would be it then . <gap> <vocalsound> No . So we we can go for <disfmarker> I have no idea . You didn't put it in ? Or <disfmarker> That w <gap> . <gap> it's not really English . <vocalsound> Let me check . I know . Uh kick off . Oh working design I got it . Yeah . So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . Here you go . Alright how do I uh skip pages ? Just uh press uh <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah . The keys yeah ? Yeah . Alright . Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . And well the info on the website which came too late . Mm-hmm . Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . Mm-hmm . Those were my uh starting points . Mm-hmm . Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Mm . And then make the Design ? the design , a the actual design , Design yeah . Yeah . but I never came around to do that . So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . Okay . I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . Mean you press a button um <vocalsound> the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , Mm-hmm . which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . Yeah frequency . Yeah . Mm-hmm . And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ Yeah decoder . and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . Um <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Yeah well this was actually <vocalsound> all I got around to do . <vocalsound> Blank . Yeah okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Work harder . <vocalsound> Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Whatever . Yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it . Yeah . 'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . Mm . And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . We have to make be clear what that is . <gap> group of users , or <disfmarker> Yeah users . because it says below forty I mean . <vocalsound> Yeah so I think it's easy but <disfmarker> I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female <disfmarker> But uh it's it's also for children or just uh <disfmarker> Uh six <disfmarker> Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to <disfmarker> the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . Okay . Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . Okay . Okay . So um <disfmarker> So below forty is okay . But we need an <disfmarker> lower level which to s uh focus . How do you mean ? So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? Uh sixteen to forty . Yeah . Yeah ? 'Kay . Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . We we have to <disfmarker> Yeah . So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess . And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . Yeah . Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . Mm-hmm . But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . Design . Mm . And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> And maybe y Experienced yeah . But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? Na I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . Yeah Yeah . like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So is <disfmarker> you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are <disfmarker> Uh you can make a <disfmarker> if you make a drawing . Yeah . Yeah . Aye yeah . Uh <disfmarker> Uh <gap> . Shall I uh <disfmarker> Uh black's okay . <vocalsound> And draw it very big . Oh . Yeah . It's okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> no , it doesn't have line control , so <disfmarker> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah we get the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah well , this is basically uh it's <disfmarker> The remote ? alright the remote ? The remote , yeah ? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess . Basic . Is on top . Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand . Yeah . L left top or right uh top ? Right . Right . T I s should said right . Right top . Yeah , right . I most people are right-handed so <vocalsound> Okay . Yeah definitely . maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . <vocalsound> If you put it like like here . Or something . I dunno . Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess . Mm-hmm . Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . Do the also with the thumb . So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . You you need to be able to hold it so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Okay for example <vocalsound> if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout . Yeah okay that's true . Layout . That's for the <disfmarker> Doesn't work too well . It's uh it's bent . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I can't help it . <vocalsound> <gap> . You broke it . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah . <gap> . <vocalsound> Right . Man . <vocalsound> Yeah okay . <vocalsound> Okay you get it . Uh for example if y if you put all the <disfmarker> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Right . <vocalsound> You want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ? Yeah . And might be easier huh ? Maybe this . <gap> kind of works . Yeah ? Like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , Mm-hmm . um and here one for for Uh . And the for flipping up and down . Yeah yeah . And volume control . Yeah that that usually uh <disfmarker> like here , here , here , here . Yeah I <disfmarker> Yeah . So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh <disfmarker> Yeah . And left to right . And those can also be used for the menu . Yeah exactly . I thought <disfmarker> but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things <disfmarker> And you you have <vocalsound> And <disfmarker> most of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu , Yeah okay . For the menu . Yeah . and then if you press it you <disfmarker> the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon Mm-hmm . Yeah . and then just <disfmarker> Yeah . mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . Yeah . So you scroll into it , okay . You select a function like v like uh bass . You just adjust it with these two buttons . Yeah . Then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . And then finally say okay , exit . Mm-hmm . Or or one button to exit it . Yeah . Uh in one time I dunno , that's not really my department . <vocalsound> And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or <disfmarker> <vocalsound> That's more your uh your department to to uh to <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . But it should be <disfmarker> if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , On the left uh top yeah . yeah . I mean it's uh <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . But it's essential that there is a screen . Yeah . Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than <disfmarker> I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . Yeah . And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . But um <disfmarker> Yeah so it should be <disfmarker> I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . Yeah . This would be uh <disfmarker> Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? I mean i No that's not s sure so <disfmarker> That's not sure Okay . but it's <disfmarker> uh we need a display . Yeah may maybe because you're <disfmarker> Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . Yeah okay but <gap> only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then <disfmarker> yeah . Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . Normal for logical t Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah they're used to it . Okay the <disfmarker> yeah . That's possible . So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . Yeah . I mean if you grab it . On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button . But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . Yeah , okay . Okay we put it on top . So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo Yeah . like over here . R_R_ . And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . If you look at your mobile phones <gap> are some stripes , <vocalsound> little little holes . Yeah . Mm-hmm . Maybe on the top or even on the side . <vocalsound> Yeah maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good . Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so <disfmarker> True . Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better . Yeah . I think that top is the best option . <vocalsound> But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side <disfmarker> I dunno . Should be able to work . Yeah okay . Yeah . <gap> . Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay . Never mind . Can we leave this up to you ? <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah it doesn't matter that much . So <disfmarker> but um the screen is on top ? Which functions did we have left ? I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . Volume . Up . Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . Screen is over there . Yeah . Yeah . So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen . If we <disfmarker> Yeah . That's uh that's a good one . Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh and image options right ? Yeah . Yeah <vocalsound> Like uh bass uh <disfmarker> so sounds ? Sound ? so we need kind of an equaliser . If you <disfmarker> Yeah . Equaliser . So if you have sound <disfmarker> But not too advanced . I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass . Yeah it it's just a remote control so <disfmarker> Yeah and they're <disfmarker> Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something . They're not used often so <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . It's uh pretty hard to write . <vocalsound> Ah as <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Mm . Yeah just <disfmarker> <gap> . Okay but you have sound ? Yeah sounds . Yeah just <disfmarker> Yeah . oh y you have digital uh <disfmarker> <gap> . better write it down over there yeah . Of course . So you have sound . I'm just a <vocalsound> secretary . <vocalsound> Yeah . <vocalsound> Coffee ? <vocalsound> Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ? Yes please . Treble bass . <gap> the mono stereo option ? Yeah . Also . Uh <disfmarker> And there there was something else also . And then pitch . Pitch I believe , yeah . Pitch . Yeah . But pitch , isn't that <disfmarker> yeah that's the the height of the tone . Yeah . The fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah . Yeah okay , Yeah and mono stereo . wh why would you use that ? Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching . If people like talk like uh <disfmarker> Mm . Yeah . And also the tuning part ? Programming part . Yeah programming . Uh so we have sound , So channel programming ? yeah ? Channel programming . And yeah in the functionality of the Television uh itself uh <disfmarker> no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ? Mm . Mm . I dunno . Mm . I think it g it gets annoying . I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but <disfmarker> Yeah . We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things . Yeah . But uh the the television itself has also the the options <gap> brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . So <disfmarker> Yeah . Contrast yeah . yeah . Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with <gap> only three buttons then it's very hard to Mm . No . Uh , so contrast , y yeah contrast and brightness ? Yeah . bright , Yeah those are the most used I guess . If you look at your monitor . uh <disfmarker> And the others were in your presentation right ? So I can just copy those ? Well <vocalsound> yeah well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess . Okay . <vocalsound> It's easy . <vocalsound> Yeah . But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . I will look it up . Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options . The sound , sound and image . And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . Indeed . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Yeah . So we need two menus kind of thing . Yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . Uh-huh . And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah . Yeah with the chip and then <gap> I mean <disfmarker> <vocalsound> So you <disfmarker> Uh <disfmarker> yeah . You have an additional processor and and software part . Well <disfmarker> yeah we have power button , whether that's present . Alright . Compared to o Mm-hmm . Channel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour . L_ s Yeah . Colour . Yeah I I call it contrast . Yeah con contrast is <disfmarker> Yeah I make it c colour . Yeah okay , colour and brightness . Yeah . Um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can um <disfmarker> Yeah and automatically um <disfmarker> Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it . Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ? Yeah , autoseek . <vocalsound> Uh name a channel , or <disfmarker> Well most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . Oh they get automatic names , okay . Yeah . So you only have to choose the position on your <gap> . It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote . Yeah . Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or <disfmarker> Help . If you already programmed it . Yeah . If you want to move it . Yeah that should be possible too . Yeah . How do you call that ? <vocalsound> Yeah how do you call that ? Mm ? Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . Channels ? Yeah . I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . Ninety nine or something . Yeah . Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . S swap channels ? Can I call it that ? Yeah . Swap channels . Swap's good option . Okay . Uh other functions ? So you <disfmarker> most of the time if you if you swap it <disfmarker> S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one . Mm-hmm . <vocalsound> Okay . Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer . <vocalsound> Yeah . It's it's pretty uh <disfmarker> Okay . yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu <gap> working design . Doch . on the T_V_ . <vocalsound> Also . That's <disfmarker> you're <disfmarker> <vocalsound> He only has to figure out how it has to look . And how <vocalsound> Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? Yeah . to use <disfmarker> And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe . Yeah okay . But <disfmarker> Yeah . You did your homework . But um <disfmarker> yeah . Okay . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? To programme the channels ? No no . It should be able to do any remote . No I don't think so . No that's <disfmarker> Uh . But I think the communication with the television is difficult . But that's not our part . Yeah . No . We don't have to design a protocol so <disfmarker> No . That's true . That's true . <vocalsound> Thank god . Yeah . Okay <disfmarker> So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem . I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , No that's the <disfmarker> and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved . It's easier , <gap> it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . Yeah . So we have to think of something for that . So but <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function Yeah k kind of structure into layers . I put them on the <vocalsound> <disfmarker> On the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the <disfmarker> yeah 'cause it's now <disfmarker> there are lots and lots of documents <gap> . Yeah . Yeah I can . and <disfmarker> I'll just try to reorganise uh things . So <disfmarker> Um <disfmarker> So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ? Uh um <disfmarker> And and the layout of of the thing itself . I think <vocalsound> th I think the yeah the layout of the screen The the layout of the remote control ? <gap> . and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the <disfmarker> Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ? <gap> . No I d I think that's more in <disfmarker> <gap> . Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . Maybe more on <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . I have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design . Okay . So he's layout and you're function . Yeah . Form function okay . <vocalsound> I think that's a that's a good separation . Okay . But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? Or <disfmarker> Yeah . Mm . Are you going to do that ? Yeah . Yeah I guess so . Yeah ? I I'm going to make <disfmarker> I think i that's your department yes , yeah o okay . Yeah . because w he already knows what <disfmarker> Yeah we have to kind of work together . Yeah . If if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , Yeah . But we're not allowed . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> <vocalsound> and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly . Yeah . Okay . Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . Yeah . Yeah . And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with <gap> pages and yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I think <disfmarker> yeah . With with some l with some layers in it . So some menus . Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , Yeah . because that's always the difficulty . Every device has its own <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Well I guess this this button , the the the okay , Menu okay . menu okay . Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . Uh like uh for your mobile phone . Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . Mm . And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . Back . Yeah . So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . Or the or the no button . Mm-hmm . To go one step back you <gap> it's only two extra buttons , Yeah . W we <disfmarker> but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen <disfmarker> Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . Um the <disfmarker> one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah but they're incorporated <gap> ? Yeah okay Yeah because this this is used for both . but we we have a m Up and down is <disfmarker> yeah but maybe that's that's not uh <disfmarker> yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display . Smart ? Into your screen . Okay . So you l should leave the menu button out of here . You wanna separate uh <vocalsound> Yeah . And <gap> and just put it under the screen , the screen <disfmarker> Put it on top . Yeah j just just group group the <disfmarker> yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . Mm-hmm . Yeah . So we make a yeah a line between them . But we should place the screen on top , right ? Well <disfmarker> F oh yeah . Okay yeah we swap uh <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . But that's uh J Jurgen's department . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So we make it a <disfmarker> You just you just find out and <gap> . You just make the layout . Okay . You <disfmarker> do we do the extra two buttons or not ? Uh <disfmarker> I think you should . Yeah . It's easier . If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . Yeah okay . That's true . Yeah . Yeah . So we have a a menu button and a s And to , okay and back , also . Yeah . Okay . Okay and back button . Yeah , or confirm and back . Whatever . And of course the four arrows . Yeah . No . But those are still y doubly used . Should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ? Both the L_C_D_ <disfmarker> Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . We have a menu button and <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . That that just to to activate the screen . So <disfmarker> That's the the one with the <disfmarker> yeah okay . Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . You can navigate . Okay . But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume . Okay so that that's not uh <disfmarker> Yeah that <disfmarker> Those are Those are both both <disfmarker> multifunctional . Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . yeah . Yeah . L l litten up yeah . Yeah . That's very good idea . Oh five minutes . N Alright . Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . Light uh <disfmarker> Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . Yeah sure . Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Um <disfmarker> So <disfmarker> Anything else ? Those buttons are are lit up . I think not . But just one thing . Should we use those two ? Them ? Or only this to to scroll ? And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? I've <disfmarker> Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ? Volume . Yeah . <vocalsound> Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . Yeah . And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button . Well we have those buttons . We use all four . No <disfmarker> The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry Yeah okay go ahead . Yeah ? sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . Yeah . Yeah . So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button . And one back . Yeah that was already decided . Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh <disfmarker> yeah m a multifunctional navigation button . Okay that's what we decided earlier on . Yeah okay . Yeah . Yeah . Right okay . So <disfmarker> You wanna close down huh ? <vocalsound> yeah I wanna close down . <vocalsound> Yeah . I have to , sorry . That's okay . Yeah . it's not because I don't like you but <disfmarker> yh we have lunch break , Already . and then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . Yeah . And then uh we'll see <disfmarker> Alright . How m how long is the lunchbreak ? I don't know . We have to ask . <vocalsound> Nobody told me . <vocalsound> Okay . But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now ? Or first lunchbreak ? No I th believe there's first lunch break . Because I <disfmarker> I've everything in my head now <vocalsound> so <disfmarker> Yeah . Or you can just <disfmarker> Mm . Okay . Yeah ? Yeah . 'Kay . Yes . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> 'Kay . I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and <disfmarker> This is <disfmarker> Yeah . Yeah . Yes sir . <vocalsound> Time pressure . <vocalsound> 'Kay . Yeah it's a lot of pressure . <vocalsound> Yeah . Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh . That's okay . Oh yeah . <vocalsound> Oh no no . <vocalsound> Yeah we'll kick your ass later . No . <vocalsound> Uh . <vocalsound> Bring it on . <vocalsound> I don't know if it works but it should be saved . Aye <disfmarker> Y you saved it ? Does it save automatically in the project folder ? Or <disfmarker> Yeah . It's uh <disfmarker> Okay . We'll see . Just put back my laptop . Should be here . Smart board . Alright . Don't know if you can use it but <disfmarker> Okay . Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that . And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered . Yeah . I try to organise it by these three . <vocalsound> <gap> . It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the <disfmarker> Yeah <gap> yeah yeah . <vocalsound> <vocalsound> I don't really mind . I just put the minutes here and we'll see . But you got some extra information uh <disfmarker> Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder . Okay . <vocalsound> Yeah . Yeah that's just basically what I just showed . But where do you did you get the newsflash ? Yeah . Yeah I got it by <disfmarker> You're the only one uh <disfmarker> okay . yeah . <gap> internet . I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so <disfmarker> <vocalsound> Okay . Alright . Alright . Yeah . <vocalsound> Make me proud . <vocalsound> I'll try to . <vocalsound> So first we have a lunchbreak now ? <vocalsound> Yeah . Alright . I believe so . <gap> just ask . <vocalsound> Mm-hmm . I dunno where she <gap> .

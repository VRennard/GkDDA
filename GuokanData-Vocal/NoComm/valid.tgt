The Project Manager introduced the project to the group. The group set an agenda for the meeting and discussed the materials sent to them by the Account Manager. They discussed and explained their roles in the project. The group began a discussion about their initial ideas for the product. They discussed several usability features: adding speech recognition and an option to choose what to watch by channel or by content, reducing the number of buttons by using the television screen to display options, and adding a light adaptation system. All participants were instructed to gather more information for the next meeting, the functional design meeting. All participants were instructed to gather information for the functional design meeting. The group decided to include an option for the user to choose what to watch by channel or by content or program type. The project agenda and the participant roles were not clear to all participants at the beginning of the meeting. The group could not decide if they wanted to include speech recognition in the design.
The User Interface Designer presented the prototype of the product to the group. The product featured an LCD display, a flip panel, and a customizable case back. The Project Manager displayed the cost of all of the components, and the group decided that the current budget would not allow the addition of the LCD display. The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the addition of the display. The Marketing Expert gave a presentation on sales projection and showed that the current projected sales point would probably not allow the project to reach its profit aim. The group also discussed the distribution and promotion of the product on the internet. The User Interface Designer expressed concern that there would not be time under the current plan to make changes to the product resulting from consumer testing; the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made. The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release. The Project Manager will negotiate with production companies and with management to decrease the cost of production. He will also present the new promotion plan to management. The Marketing Expert will begin his marketing plan after production has begun. The group will evaluate the product after real units have been produced. The group decided that the LCD display will be included in the design and that the microphone for the remote will be placed on the side of the device. The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the integration of the display into the design. The group will work with other companies to promote the product and have it released along with other products or with an event, such as a sporting event. The Project Manager decided that no additional changes will be made to the remote. The product evaluation will occur at a later time, after the production of some real units have been produced, rather than evaluating the prototype. The group will have to make many changes to their original budget plans after the final cost analysis showed that their current budget would not cover the cost of all components and that the current price point would not meet the expected profit goal. The group had problems agreeing on the project agenda, if more or less time should have been alotted for user testing and making changes to the design.
The meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly, telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house. The project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated, and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors. The marketing expert resumes, talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful. The industrial designer gives her presentation, talking about components, materials, and energy sources. They discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children, making the buttons various shapes, and putting a display clock on the control. The interface designer presents, talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a T-shape and add an alarm clock function. They discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases. They close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases. They cannot make a device that works on the whole house- will need a focus. They will eliminate teletext. They will maintain the corporate image by using the proper designs and colors. Their target group is basically everybody who owns a TV. They are concerned about making the control marketable to a wide range of age groups, and have discussed making removable plastic covers so that the look is changeable. However, they need to do more research on this topic. They do not know if their budget will allow them to include all the features they would like to such as a light emitter, clock, alarm clock, and child lock.
The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves by name and their role in the project. The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then had the team members participate in a tool training exercise in which each member drew his favorite animal on the white board and discussed what he liked about the animal. The project manager also discussed selling prices and the project budget. The team then discussed their experiences with remotes, focusing on various features they would like to see in the remote they will produce, as well as features they find unappealing in current remotes. The interface designer will work on the technical functions of the remote. The marketing expert will find the user requirements for the remote The remote will sell for 25 Euro. The remote will be sold internationally. The production costs cannot exceed 12.50 Euro.
The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting. The interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces. The group comments on her presentation, and then the industrial designer begins presenting. She talks about the technical electronic components of the remote, explains how a remote works, and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control. She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable, using a rechargable battery, and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip. The marketing expert presents, talking about user preferences for a small, simple, eye-catching, cute, appealing, and functional remote. Fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year, so a soft, spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable. The group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition, noting that if it is good quality it could be costly. They about the power source and review the objectives of the product. The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete. The marketing expert will do the product evaluation. The industrial designer and interface specialist will work together on a prototype using modeling clay. The industrial designer will come up with a user interface design. Their coaches will send specific instructions and answer questions. They decided that the product should be bright, colorful, trendy in design, strong, compact, have push buttons, and contain supplement features (possibly mute button, swapping button, voice recognition). The power source will be batteries because it is cost-effective. The group would like to include voice recognition as a feature, but they are not sure about how much it would cost. This will require further research by the industrial engineer.
The Project Manager gave new requirements for the product: the remote will not include a teletext function, will only be used for television, and must show the corporate image. The Industrial Designer presented  possible components to consider. The group then discussed hard materials to include in the design. The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan and showed that there is a demand for remotes featuring voice recognition and other capabilities; the group discussed how it could be integrated into the functional design. The Project Manager offered to help the Industrial Designer find companies to provide help in integrating this component. The designers expressed that they needed more information from the board on their expectations for the product. The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on product design from the user's perspective and emphasized simplicity in design. She also suggested that the group make a decision on which features to include in the final product design, but the group decided to postpone it. The designers were given their assignments: the Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept; the User Interface Designer, the user interface concept; the Industrial Designer, the components concept. The Industrial Designer will make a presentation on the components concept for the product. The User Interface Designer will make a presentation on the user interface concept. The Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept. The Project Manager will research companies that can provide the Industrial Designer with help on integrating voice recognition into her design. The group will discuss which features to include in and eliminate from the final design of the product at the next meeting. The remote will have a slim shape and a simple interface, include a locator function and voice recognition, and be made of a hard material. The group was not sure whether to proceed in the design process with all of the desired functions and eliminate them later, or to eliminate some features before creating the design concept. There was a lack of sufficient information from the board on their expectations for the design of the remote, whether they expected a simple device or a more costly one with many features.
The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the upcoming project to the team members. The team members then participated in an exercise in which each team member drew his favorite animal and discussed why he liked the particular animal. After the drawing exercise, the project manager discussed selling prices and production costs for the remote the team will design. The project manager also indicated that the remote will be sold internationally and that two million remotes are expected to be sold. The team then discussed their experiences using remotes in the past and what features to consider implementing in the remote they will produce. The team members discussed child proof capabilities, color options, how to adapt a remote for left-handed users, a "go back" function, the size of a remote, buttons, and LCD screens. The project manager closed the meeting and gave the team members their assignments and then one of the team members briefly went over his role on the team. The team members will work on the ideas which arose during the meeting and decide which ones are useful and which ones should be discarded. The team members will work on the technical aspects of the remote The remote will be sold for 25 Euro. The production costs for the remote will be 12.50 Euro maximum. The remote will be child proof. The remote will be colorful and will have different colored changeable face plates. The remote will be adaptable so that it can be used by right-handed and left-handed people. The remote will feature a button which allows the user to return to the previous channel he was viewing. Size of remote. Whether to include a screen similar to one found on a cell phone on the remote. How many buttons and actions to include on the remote.
The Industrial Designer gave her components concept presentation, which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design. She announced that their only choice for casing material was wood, so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases. The User Interface Designer gave her presentation on the user interface concept for the product, and gave a basic layout of the remote's key functions. The Marketing Expert presented the marketing concept and discussed including a display to facilitate use. The group discussed the unique, custom design of the remote, and quickly talked about finding a manufacturer that could make the custom cases cheaply that still paid fair wages. The group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design, and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design. The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer were instructed to begin building a prototype, and the Marketing Expert was instructed to work on the marketing strategy as well as research the cost of the display component. The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer will design the prototype of the remote control. The Marketing Expert will find out how much the display component costs and will present his marketing strategy at the next meeting. The group decided on the features that will be included in the final design of the prototype. The remote will have customized wood casing and ergonomic sizing, voice recognition, a locator function, rubber buttons in a simple arrangement, an advanced chip, and a battery life indicator. The group discussed including a display on the remote, but the prototype will be designed without a display until the Marketing Expert finds out how much it would cost to add it. The group decided to contact another company to manufacture the product that could do it cheaply yet still paid fair wages. The number of options for the material used for the casing was restricted; the group was left with one material that could be used for the product. There was a lack of information on how much certain components would cost.
The project manager went over the agenda. The industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source, materials and components. He recommended using kinetic energy, and having a double-curved rubber case. The group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy. The marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material. He explained that the remote should look fancy, and be technologically innovative and easy to use. He suggested using removable customisable covers, speech recognition, installing some games into the remote, and implementing a parental control feature. The user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons. Most features will be controlled through the menu. The group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition. After a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature. The project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management. The group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote, including having an animated logo on the touch screen. The project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting. The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype, using the SMARTboard.  The marketing expert will work on the product evaluation. The energy source will be a combination of batteries and kinetic energy. The case will be double-curved and made of rubber, with fruity-coloured removable covers. There will be a touch screen and not many buttons. The remote will include games and a simple parental control feature. It will not use speech recognition. The user interface designer had problems with his laptop while he was preparing his presentation. The group were unsure about how to implement a parental control feature, or if it would be worth the time and money.
The project manager stated the agenda and set the goals for the current meeting. The industrial designer discussed different options for batteries, case materials and shapes, chips, and interface components and also discussed the components necessary for a speech recognition capable remote control. The user interface designer presented his concept for the interface design which he called the "millennium remote control". The user interface designer also discussed with the team color options and how to make a "smart" remote which is in tune with the user's preferences. The marketing expert discussed current findings from trend watching reports which indicated that there is a desire for products to have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, be easy to use, incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme, and be spongy. The project manager gave the team members their assignments and then the team went over the decisions they had made and discussed whether to use titanium or rubber in their design. The user interface designer will work on the interface design. The marketing expert will work on the product evaluation. The user interface designer and industrial designer will work together on a prototype The remote will contain a speech recognizer. The remote will have some buttons. The remote will incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme. The remote will feature an LCD screen. The remote will use two regular batteries. Whether to allow the LCD or the remote case to come in different colors. How to account for the increase in production costs for a remote that comes in different colors. How to make a "smart" remote. Whether to make a remote out of rubber or titanium. Whether the team should invent their own trend.
The project manager opened the meeting and stated the agenda to the team members. The marketing expert discussed the findings of a survey which indicated that current remotes are ugly, difficult to use, have a number of unused buttons, frustrate users when misplaced, and contribute to RSI. The marketing expert also stated that young users like speech recognition and that users in general want buttons for power, channel selection, volume control, and a few lesser used settings. The user interface designer presented existing remotes to exemplify the need for simpler designs, discussed the use of components such as titanium and a back-lit LCD screen, and discussed other features to consider such as color options. The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and how to handle universal capability and speech recognition. After the project manager's closing, the project manager recapped some decisions and the team discussed how to handle the issue of locating a remote when misplaced. The industrial designer will focus on the components concept. The user interface designer will focus on the user interface concept. The marketing expert will work on trend watching The team will not work with teletext. The team will concentrate on making a remote only for televisions and then make their product more generalized later. An automatic on/off feature will not be used. Making the remote universal. Users habits in jumping from channel to channel. How speech recognition commands work. Allowing users in the same household to have their own remotes with personal settings. How to locate a remote when misplaced.
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes, one with an LCD screen and one without. They demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand. They discussed their modular design. They discussed the parental control module and the titanium casing. The production costs were below budget for the basic models. The Marketing Expert presented three important user requirements, and also the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. He then led an evaluation of the prototypes according to these requirements. The group did not feel that the remotes sufficiently met the criteria. They decided to continue working on the design and to take out the LCD screen and voice recognition. They discussed the modular design and its advantages in attracting customers. The group discussed how to incorporate the fashion trends; it was suggested that one shape was used, which could be customized with skins. The Project Manager led an evaluation of the group's experience on the project. The group was pleased with the teamwork and leadership, but one participant complained that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda. The remote will feature rechargeable double-A batteries and a charging stand. The remote can be customized for adults, children, or the elderly. The remote has a misplacement reminder that sends a message to the television screen to remind users to put the remote back in the charger when not in use. The remote features a modular design that allows users to add as many or as few components as they wish to the basic model. The group was unsatisfied with the design and decided to continue working on it, focusing on a fancier design. The remote will not feature an LCD screen or voice recognition. The group decided that the teamwork and leadership of the project were good, but that not enough information was given about each meeting's agenda. The group had difficulty deciding what would be displayed on the LCD screen. The group felt that too much focus was placed on the functionality of the remote such that they could not achieve a fancy look. The group did not feel that the prototype met the user requirements presented by the Marketing Expert. The group could not decide how to incorporate the fashion trends into the design. Not enough information was given about the agenda of each meeting.
The group introduced themselves to each other and discussed their roles in the project. The Project Manager opened a discussion about the project plan and asked the Marketing Expert to prepare an overall plan for the project. The Marketing Expert presented the initial aim of the project: the creation of a fresh, user-friendly remote control device. The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to create a functional design plan for the device, then asked the Marketing Expert about ideas for the sales strategy. The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan: to analyze the competition and to pinpoint the target marketing group. The Project Manager instructed all participants to work together on their respective design plans. The Project Manager decided that the design plans will be discussed at the next meeting, and that the next step will be to come up with a functional design of the device. The Marketing Expert will prepare a sales plan for the product and discuss the project budget and the sales strategy. The Industrial Designer will prepare an initial functional design. The User Interface Designer will contribute studies on user requirements to the functional design. The Project Manager will post his presentation to be available for all participants. The group will discuss the design plans of the three experts at the next meeting. The group will first work on a functional design of the device. The group did not receive sufficient information about the project in advance to be prepared to create a project plan in the first meeting.
The Industrial Designer presented options for each component. He suggested kinetic energy, a titanium case, and rubber push buttons. The group will ask if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. The User Interface Designer introduced the graphical user interface to the group and suggested using an LCD screen. He presented several existing products and suggested the following: large buttons; voice recognition; either push, scroll, or spinning buttons; and incorporating some customizable components. The group discussed including a help button; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated. The Marketing Expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost, complicated, and ugly. He showed that users were willing to pay more for a fancy remote. He suggested the LCD screen; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user's television as a display screen, but that they would inquire about cost before deciding. The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons. The group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children. They discussed the sensitivity of the voice recognizer to other noises; the group will ask about the capability of the recognizer. The group will find out if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and the scroll button. The group will ask about the capability of the voice recognition component. The group decided not to include a help button on the device because it would make the remote seem more complicated. There was not enough information about the capabilities of the voice recognizer or the kinetic energy source. There was not enough information on the cost of several components. No decision was made about whether or not the LCD screen should be included. No decision was made about including a locator function, or what form it should take. No decision was made about making the remote programmable for children.
The project manager stated that the goal for the current meeting was to decide upon a concept for the remote the team is creating. The marketing expert discussed his findings from trend watching reports. He found that current trends are such that a product must have a fancy look and feel, be technologically innovative, be easy to use, incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif, and must be spongy. The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for a remote that is easy to use. The user interface designer discussed the placement of commonly used buttons, the overall shape of a remote, and how to hide less commonly used buttons. The industrial designer discussed various components and energy sources the remote could include. The industrial designer focused on the use of a TFT screen and the use of solar cells to supplement the energy from two regular batteries. The team then discussed and made decisions regarding the option to use solar cells, the specifications of an LCD screen, how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif into their design, and how to hide lesser used buttons. The industrial designer will work on the look and feel of the design. The user interface designer will work on the user interface design. The marketing expert will work on the project evaluation. The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on a prototype The remote will feature a small sized LCD screen. The LCD screen on the remote will be a touch screen. The remote will resemble a banana. The remote will use infra-red technology. The remote will have a spongy outer layer. The remote will have a hidden layer containing the lesser used buttons. The remote will use speech recognition. Size of TFT screen and its impact on the size of the remote overall. Whether users will expose the remote to sunlight to recharge it if the remote contains solar cells. The size and shape of the remote. How to incorporate a fruit and vegetable motif into the design of the remote. How to have a fruit shaped remote with an LCD screen. How to hide the lesser used buttons.
The meeting opens with the group doing introductions by giving their name and role. Betty is the project manager, Francina is the user interface specialist, Eileen is the marketing expert, and Jeanne is the industrial designer. The project manager tells them they will be designing a new remote control that should be original, trendy, and user-friendly. They will be concerned with functional, conceptional, and detailed design. To try out the whiteboard, each group member draws her favorite animal on the board. They discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls. They seemed to agree that the remote should be compact and have a multi-purpose functions. They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors, materials, and shapes. They also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal, whether it is a beep or light. Then they close the meeting with the project manager going over the tasks they are to complete and telling them they will meet again in about thirty minutes. The industrial designer will work on the working design and technical function. The interface specialist will do the working design and functional design. The marketing manager will look for user requirement specifications such as friendliness Selling price will be twenty five Euro. Company aims to profit fifty million Euro. It should be compact, multi-functional, different in shape/color/material. Have a locator to help find the remote when it is lost. The group if not sure if they will have the budget to make the gadget multi-functional, but they would like to make one that would control basically all household machines.
The project manager opened the meeting and then the marketing expert discussed user requirements. The marketing expert also found that younger users want an LCD display and a remote capable of speech recognition. The interface specialist discussed the interior workings of a remote and stated a preference for using radio waves over infra-red technology. The industrial designer discussed particular components that a remote could include. The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and initiated a discussion in which the team discussed and decided on various features to include in the remote they will produce. The team will not work with teletext. The remote will only be used for televisions. The corporate image must be recognizable in the product. The remote will have buttons for channel changing, volume settings, numerals, and power on/off. The remote will feature an LCD screen. Lesser used functions will be able to be accessed on the remote but they will be hidden on the remote. The remote will not have a time button. Cost of adding speech recognition to a remote. Whether using radio waves will interfere with other technology a user owns. Cost of infra-red components. How to minimize the number of buttons on the remote while having buttons to access channels. Whether to include lesser used functions in the remote. Whether to have a power button. Whether to have a timer feature. Whether to have a display function.
The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design, features, and power source, type of chip and weight of the remote. They go through the evaulations, using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert. They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is, how handy it is, how functional, how cool it is, whether they would spend twenty five euro for it, and whether they would change their current remote for this one. Next they do a cost estimate for production. In doing this, they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries. They keep the regular chip, stick with plastic, put two scroll wheels and three push buttons, and make it a special shade of yellow. They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions. They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting. It will be shaped like a banana, with an base station resembling a banana leaf for it to sit on. The volume scroll wheel will be on the left, channel scroll on the right. Will contain a teletext button, when pressed teletext appears and channel selector can be used to navigate through the teletext. Infared port on top of banana as well as bottom front of base station. Weight of an actual banana but a special shade of yellow. Three push buttons. For pricing reasons eliminate solar cells - use rechargable batteries as power source, base station used for battery-charging which should last 8-10 hours depending on frequency of use. For pricing reasons they will use a regular chip for the control rather than advanced one. For pricing reasons the remote will have a single, not double curve. For pricing reasons they had to use a regular chip instead of advanced, single curve instead of double, rechargable batteries instead of solar cells, and eliminate the turbo button.
This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. It has on-off and volume buttons, an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours, which largely replaces the use of push buttons, and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface, which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness, technology, robustness, usefulness, size, colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype, although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. Finally, the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team, they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. After the team realised the prototype was over budget, they replaced the battery with a hand dynamo. When it became evident from the costs of components and materials that they would have to do without either the LCD or the speech recognition, they decided to change the given prices in order to accommodate them to their design and budget. The gratuitous presence of decorative rubber strawberries on a titanium case (even if they cover sensors) did not meet everyone's approval. Although, the attempt was towards keeping with the current fashion trends, the result did not satisfy the program manager. The prototype was more than 40% over budget. The team realised that their budget did not allow for all the specifications of their prototype.
The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements. The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of a remote control and showed a diagram of how they operate together. He suggested that field programmable gateway arrays be used for the chip controlling software functionalities, and it was suggested that the remote be used with a recharging stand. The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on the technical functions of the remote, and displayed the interfaces of two existing products for comparison. He showed that the competitors' remotes were too complicated. He suggested that the televisions that the remotes are used with connect to the internet to access downloadable programs. He suggested a simple design with few buttons, small size, and a locator function. The Marketing Expert presented several characteristics important to users. He discussed using speech recognition and ways to make it feasible for the project, small size, low price point, and incorporating teletext in different languages. The group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design, and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television. The remote will be used with a recharging stand. The group decided not to include a lighting adaptation system. The participants disagreed on how to easily move through channels using the design of the User Interface Designer, which included very few buttons. There was no resolution on whether or not to allow users to use the remote to access the internet through their television, as opposed to including teletext capabilities.
